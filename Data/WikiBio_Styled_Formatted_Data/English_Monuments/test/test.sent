paulistano, founded in 1900 and one of the oldest clubs in town and 11-time champions of são paulo, abandoned football due to the professionalization of the sport.
palmeiras, founded in 1902 and three-time champions of são paulo, intended after the end of the season 1929 to set up a professional team, but failed to do so.

paulistano brought to the union star players arthur friedenreich and araken patuska.
palmeiras' contribution was the stadium estádio da floresta, generally known as chácara da floresta.

the jerseys of the new club were derived from palmeiras, which were white and sported a black ring across the chest.
to the black-and-white of palmeiras was added the red-and-white of paulistano, and the ring became red, white, and black.

internal arguments and turmoil led to financial problems.
the club merged with clube de regatas tietê, another sports club from the town, and the football department was disbanded on 14 may 1935.
just after the merger with tietê, the founders and re-founders created the grêmio tricolor, which formed clube atlético são paulo on 4 june 1935, and, finally, são paulo futebol clube on 16 december of the same year.
the new club's first game was against portuguesa santista on 25 january 1936. the match was almost cancelled, owing to the city's anniversary, but porphyrio da paz, the football director and composer of the club's anthem, obtained permission from the board of education office for the game to continue.
another merger occurred in 1938, this time with clube atlético estudantes paulista, from the neighborhood of moóca, and the club finished as runners-up in the campeonato paulista.
in 1940, when the estádio do pacaembu was inaugurated, a new era began in são paulo state football.
são paulo futebol clube finished as runners-up once again in the campeonato paulista in 1941, and a year later the club paid 200 and a year later the club paid 200 contos de réis (equivalent to approximately r$162,000 today) to acquire leônidas from flamengo.
during this period, são paulo also acquired the argentinian antónio sastre and brazilians noronha, josé carlos bauer, zezé procópio, luizinho, rui and teixeirinha.
with these new additions, tricolor became known as the steam roller, winning the paulista championship five times, in 1943, 1945, 1946, 1948 and 1949. the club sold its canindé training ground to portuguesa to raise money for their new stadium the estádio do morumbi, for which construction began in 1952.
the run of success of the 1940s, came to an end in the early 1950s, and the club only won two state championships in the new decade, in 1953 and 1957. the latter championship was won with the help of the 35-year-old brazilian international zizinho and hungarian manager béla guttmann both of them becoming idols.
in the years that followed, the club struggled to compete with the rise of pelé and his club, santos.
with the construction of the morumbi stadium still ongoing, são paulo entered its longest period without a title in its history, which was to last 13 years.
since são paulo's budget planning was focused on the estádio do morumbi construction rather than the signing of new players, few expensive players were bought during the 1960s, although the club did acquire brazilian internationals roberto dias and jurandir.
in 1960, the estádio do morumbi was inaugurated, named after the late cícero pompeu de toledo, the club's chairman during most of the stadium construction.

sport club corinthians paulista (brazilian portuguese: [isˈpɔʁtʃi ˈklubi kʊˈɾĩtʃɐ̃s pawˈɫistɐ]) is a brazilian sports club based in the city of  são paulo.
although they compete in a number of different sports, corinthians is mostly known for its professional association football team.
the football team plays in the campeonato brasileiro série a,[nb 1] the top tier of the brazilian football, as well as in the campeonato paulista série a1,[nb 2] the first division of the traditional in-state competition.
founded in 1910 by five railway workers, corinthians was inspired by the london-based club corinthian football club.
since 1910, corinthians has become one of the most successful brazilian clubs, having won the national title seven times, in addition to three copa do brasil trophies.
corinthians has a record 30 state championships.
in 2000 the club won the fifa club world cup's first edition as the host team and in 2012 the club won the fifa club world cup for the second time after winning the copa libertadores de américa for the first time.
the club was listed by forbes as the most valuable football club in the americas, worth $576.9 million.
the club is one of the most widely supported teams in the world and the second most in brazil, with over 30 million fans.
since 2014, corinthians has played its home matches at the arena corinthians, one of the venues in the 2014 fifa world cup, having hosted six matches during the tournament, including the opener on 12 june 2014.
the club's home kit traditionally features white shirts and black shorts, accompanied by white socks, since 1920. their traditional crest was introduced in 1939, by modernist painter francisco rebolo featuring the são paulo state flag in a shield, two oars, and an anchor (representing the club's early success in nautical sports).
they hold many longstanding rivalries, most notably against palmeiras, são paulo, and santos.
in 1910, football in brazil was an elitist sport.
the top clubs were formed by people who were part of the upper classes.
among them were club athletico paulistano, são paulo athletic club, & associação atlética das palmeiras.
lower-class society excluded from larger clubs founded their own minnow clubs and only played "floodplain" football.
bucking the trend, a group of five workers of the são paulo railway, more precisely joaquim ambrose and anthony pereira (wall painters), rafael perrone (shoemaker), anselmo correia (driver) and carlos silva (general laborer), residents of the neighborhood of bom retiro.
it was august 31, 1910 when these workers were watching a match featuring a london-based club touring brazil, corinthian f.c..  after the match, while the group returned home, the men spoke of partnerships, business ideas, and general dreams of grandeur.
in the mind of each one surfaced a great idea: the foundation of a club, after several exchanges in a lively argument, a common ground led those athletes the same dream.
the arguments led to the conclusion that they would meet the next day to make a dream into reality.
september 1, 1910. in anticipation of heavy rains, the group agreed to meet after sundown in public sight.
that night at 8:30pm, on rua josé paulino ("rua dos imigrantes" (immigrants street), underneath the glow of an oil lamp the five workers reunited alongside their guest and neighbors from bom retiro.
that night the club was founded, alongside its board of directors, who elected miguel battaglia as the first club president.
corinthians played their first match on september 10, 1910, away against união da lapa, a respected amateur club in são paulo; and despite being defeated by 1–0, this match would mark the beginning of a successful era as an amateur club.
on september 14, luis fabi scored corinthians' first goal against estrela polar, another amateur club in the city, and corinthians won their first game 2–0.
with good results and an increasing number of supporters, corinthians joined the liga paulista, after winning two qualifying games, and played in the são paulo state championship for the first time, in 1913. just one year after joining the league, corinthians was crowned champion for the first time (in 1914), and were again two years later.
there were many fly-by-night teams popping up in são paulo at the time, and during the first practice held by corinthians a banner was placed by the side of the field stating "this one will last".
the year of 1922, the centennial of brazilian independence, marks the start of corinthians hegemony in the são paulo state championship.
as football was almost exclusively played at rio de janeiro and são paulo by that time, the two state champions were considered to be the two top clubs in brazil.
after defeating the rio de janeiro state championship champion of that year, américa, corinthians joined the company of the great teams in brazil.
the same year also marked the first of three state championships in a row, something that happened again in 1928–30 and 1937–39.
corinthians seemed destined to win state championships in threes; after six years without being a champions, they came won three more from 1937 the 1939. the 1940s were a more difficult time; and the club would win a championship in 1941 and would only win their next in 1951.
at the beginning of the 1950s corinthians made history in the são paulo championship.
in 1951, the team composed of carbone, cláudio, luisinho, baltasar and mário scored 103 goals in thirty matches of the são paulo championship, registering an average of 3.43 per game.
carbone was the top goalscorer of the competition with 30 goals.
the club would also win the são paulo championships of 1952 and 1954. in this same decade, corinthians were champions three times of the rio-são paulo championship (1950, 1953 and 1954), the tournament that was becoming most important in the country with the increased participation of the greatest clubs from the two most important footballing states in the country.
in 1953, in a championship in venezuela, corinthians won the small cup of the world, a championship that many consider as a precursor of the worldwide championship of clubs.
on the occasion, corinthians, substituting for vasco da gama, went to caracas, the venezuelan capital and recorded six consecutive victories against roma (1–0 and 3–1), barcelona (3–2 and 1–0) and selection of caracas (2–1 and 2–0).
the club would also win the cup of the centenary of são paulo, in the same year (1954).
after the triumphs in the são paulo championship and the rio-são paulo of 1954, corinthians had a lengthy title drought.
the breakthrough finally came when they won the são paulo state championship in 1977, breaking a string of 23 years without a major title.
under the leadership of sócrates, wladimir and casagrande, corinthians were the first brazilian club in which players decided about concentração, a common brazilian practice where the football players were locked up in a hotel days before a game, and discussed politics.
(in the early 1980s, military dictatorship, after two decades, ended in brazil).
in 1982, before the election of government of são paulo state, the team wore a kit with the words: dia 15 vote (vote on 15th), trying to motivate the biggest number of fans to vote.
in 1990, corinthians won their first campeonato brasileiro série a, beating their rivals, são paulo in the final at the opponents' own stadium, estádio do morumbi.
in the following year, corinthians beat flamengo and won the supercopa do brasil.
in the 1995, the club won the copa do brasil for the first time, beating grêmio in the final at the estádio olímpico monumental in porto alegre.
in the same decade, the club won the state championship in 1995, 1997 and 1999, and won the national championship again in 1998 and in 1999.
in 2001 and in 2003 and the copa do brasil in 2002, beating brasiliense in the final.
between 1990 and 2005, the club also won the ramón de carranza trophy in 1996, the rio-são paulo tournament in 2002, the são paulo youth cup in 1995, 1999, 2004, and 2005, and the dallas cup in 1999 and 2000.
the club's situation in early 2004 was among the most difficult in their history.
bad administration, lack of money and terrible campaigns both in the 2003 brazilian championship and in the 2004 são paulo state championship caused their millions of supporters to worry.
fortunately, some young players and a new manager tite helped the team to improve from their terrible start.
at the end of the championship, corinthians finished in 5th place and gained entry to the copa sudamericana (a minor continental championship).
this situation was one of the factors which enabled corinthians' president, alberto dualib, to convince the club's advisors to sign a controversial deal with an international fund of investors called media sports investment.
the deal granted the company a large degree of control over the club for 10 years in exchange for large financial investments in return.
this has brought many quality players to the team, such as carlos tevez, roger, javier mascherano and carlos alberto.
despite the msi investments, corinthians experienced a slow start in the 2005 state championship, but managed to improve as it progressed, eventually managing to finish second.
their start to the brazilian championship during 2005 was difficult, too, but after daniel passarella's dismissal (due to an unexpected 5–1 loss to corinthians' rivals, são paulo), the club finished the championship round well, and were eventually crowned brazilian champions for the fourth time, after a controversial annulment of eleven games due to a betting scandal.
the relationship between corinthians' managers and the msi president, kia joorabchian was not good, and after being eliminated in the copa libertadores, the club experienced a crisis which was responsible for the bad performances for the rest of 2006. eventually, the partnership came to an end.
on december 2, 2007, following a 1–1 draw away to grêmio, corinthians were relegated to the second division.
corinthians, who won promotion to the top division of brazilian football for 2009 by winning the serie b tournament, signed with three-time fifa player of the year ronaldo.
in 2009, led by ronaldo, corinthians won their 26th campeonato paulista and their third copa do brasil.
confirming the club's good moment, corinthians finished the campeonato brasileiro 2010 in 3rd place, granting their place on the subsequent copa libertadores.after being eliminated from the south american tournament by the relatively less traditional deportes tolima, though, corinthians saw ronaldo retire from football.
to replace him, the club signed with other 2006 national squad veteran adriano.
in 2011, corinthians won their fifth national title.
on july 4, after reaching the final of the 2012 copa libertadores undefeated, corinthians won its first title after a two-match final against 6-time champions boca juniors by drawing 1–1 in argentina and accomplishing an inaugural victory at the estádio do pacaembu in são paulo winning 2–0, becoming the ninth brazilian side to win the copa libertadores.
after this historical title, corinthians is considered the most valuable club in brazil.
the club won the 2012 fifa club world cup for their second time after defeating english club chelsea 1–0 on december 16, 2012.
even though the club has been recognized by the colors black and white for most of their history, the first corinthians' kit originally consisted of cream shirts and black shorts.
back then, the choice of colors proved wrong, because when the shirts were washed, the cream color would gradually fade white, representing a cost a recently created club could not afford.
thus, early after the foundation, the official shirt colors were changed to white.
in 1954 the traditional black with thin white stripes uniform was introduced, and became the alternative uniform since then.
the corinthians' shirt had no badge or crest until 1913, when the club joined the liga paulista, that mandated that every club in the competition should have one in their uniforms.
a simple composition of the letters c (corinthians) and p (paulista) was hastily created and embroidered on the players uniforms for the upcoming matches, thus being considered the club's first de facto badge.
unlike the kit, the badge went through several changes over the years.
in 1914, lithographer hermogenes barbuy, brother of then-player amilcar barbuy designed the club's first official badge, which premiered at a friendly against torino (italy), in são paulo.
in 1919, the round shield with the são paulo state flag was introduced, and modified in 1939 by modernist painter francisco rebolo, a former reserve player of the club in the 1920s, to include a string, an anchor and two oars, representing the early success the club achieved in nautical sports.
thereafter, the badge passed through small changes over time, specifically in the flag and in the frame.
in 1990, a yellow star was added above the badge to celebrate corinthians' first national title.
the same would occur when achieving the national titles in 1998, 1999 and 2005, and a larger star was introduced in 2000 after winning the inaugural fifa club world cup.
the stars remained as part of the badge until 2011, when the board decided the badge would not present any stars in the future.

the first field of the corinthians was in the neighborhood of bom retiro, where the club was founded in 1910. more precisely in the old street of immigrants, current rua josé paulino.
it was actually a stadium, but a vacant lot owned by a seller of firewood.
it was nicknamed "field lenheiro."
it was the time of the floodplain and the players themselves had to clean and flatten the lawn.
in january 1918, corinthians opened its first stadium, in great bridge (now the bridge of flags), on the banks of tiete river.
the land was leased from the municipality under the influence of the intellectual antonio de alcantara machado, one of the first to approach the club workers.
stood beside the chácara da floresta, aa das palmeiras (one of the largest clubs in the city so far)'s stadium and was built by the players and fans in a community helping system.
the corinthians played their games there until 1927. they played 138 games with 83 wins, 43 draws and 12 defeats.
in 1926, the club purchased parque são jorge, located within the tatuapé.
the parque são jorge belonged to esporte clube sírio, a rival in the disputes of the football season.
after purchase, then-president ernesto cassano decided to reform the stage, with financial support from the members.
while the reforms were carried out, followed the corinthians sending their matches in the area of great bridge.
once stopped reforms in the parque são jorge, in 1928, the field of ponte grande was donated to são bento (no relation to present-day esporte clube são bento).
the renovated parque são jorge, still without floodlights, was inaugurated on july 22, in a friendly game against américa-rj.
the land purchased with the original included a syrian farm - hence the nickname "fazendinha", still used today.
it was from here that the corinthians began to develop and could build up its headquarters.
in estádio alfredo schürig, the official name of "fazendinha", the club only played in 468 deals, with 346 wins, 60 draws and 62 defeats.
1312 goals were scored by timão and 480 conceded.
the last game played there was a friendly against brasiliense on august 3, 2002. currently, the parque são jorge is used for training and games of smaller categories.
the board has the idea of reforming it, but the plans never leave paper.
with the growing number of fans, corinthians began operating in major stadiums, in particular, the club has established a relationship with paulo machado de carvalho stadium, which belongs to the municipality of são paulo and is best known as pacaembu stadium.
some 50,000 fans attended the inauguration of the stadium on april 28 of 1940. the primary pitted palestra italia and coritiba.
then, the game between corinthians background, then current three-time champion são paulo, and atlético mineiro, corinthians won by 4–2.
the pacaembu was opened as the largest stadium in the latin america, with capacity for 70,000 people.
in 1942, little more than 70,000 people came to the stadium to watch the match between corinthians and são paulo, in particular by the attacker leonidas da silva, idol-pauline and are considered the best brazilian player in his time.
the game ended tied at 3–3 and the public was never beaten that game at the stadium.
currently, the pacaembu has capacity for up to 40,000 spectators.
former partner group htmf bought land in the raposo tavares highway in the late 1990s for the stadium construction, but the partnership ended soon after that.
in 2009 there were some conjectures that the government of são paulo could make a deal for a 30-year allotment of pacaembu, but it never materialized, even though it was the club's directors preference, with projects designed to that matter.
after estádio do morumbi, then named as the city's host in the world cup, failed to comply to fifa's standards, a new project to create a home for corinthians emerged as a possibility.
in august 2010 the president of cbf, ricardo teixeira, along with governor of são paulo state, alberto goldman, and the mayor of são paulo, gilberto kassab announced that the opening ceremony of the world cup of brazil would be held in the new corinthians stadium to be built in the district of itaquera, in the eastern part of são paulo city.
there are 32 bedrooms in hotel ct joaquim grava; 2 players per room during pre-season, 1 to a room while in season.
the auditorium in the hotel allows for lectures & team meetings.
the hotel restaurant seats 60. the hotel is complete with physiotherapy and massage rooms ; offices for the president and the board of directors, offices for hotel administration, a locker room for the visiting team, games rooms, an internet café and a reading room.

the corinthians fanbase is fondly called fiel ("the faithful"), starring memorable moments like the "corinthian invasion" (pt / invasão corinthiana) in 1976, when more than 70,000 corinthians fans traveled from são paulo to rio de janeiro to watch the match against fluminense at maracana stadium, in that year's national championship semifinals, as well as having one of the biggest average attendances in the country.
[citation needed] fans being famous for being passionate about the team and loyal supporters motivated the club to make a tribute documentary to their fans, named  "faithful" (pt / fiel), highlighting the fans' support in one of the most difficult moments in the club's history: the relegation to national second division in 2007. similar initiatives would be made in the next years, reflecting other moments in the club's history in that the fanbase was essential.

motto:  "lealdade, humildade e procedimento" (loyalty, humility & procedure)gaviões da fiel was founded on 1 july 1969, but its ideology began to be thought of before.
in 1965, young corinthians fans gathered in the stands in order to question the political and administrative life of the corinthians.
the members gathered in different locations, members homes, workplaces, & public squares.
this group was distinguished by a passion for the club and have characteristics idealizing and fulfilling.
the foundation of gaviões, on 1 july 1969, came during a bleak time for brazilians, amidst the military dictatorship.
at a time when freedom of expression was virtually nonexistent, these young fans began to attempt recover political and administrative control of corinthians.
the corinthians were under the administration of wadih helu, who for years tried to prevent the creation of the gaviões through several reprisals.
this persecution was not enough to make them give up and gradually his ideas were maturing.
"i had decided that the name of the club should contain faithful, as well as the fans were already known to the corinthians that even after 15 years without winning a single title, crowds took to the stage."
what was simply an utopia of young lovers and revolutionary thoughts turned into reality: gaviões da fiel was born.
currently, gaviões has 97,177 members (january 14, 2013), the largest organized fan organization in brazil.
motto:  "o jogador das arquibancadas" (the player of the terraces)camisa 12 was founded in august 1971, the non-politicized offshoot of gaviões da fiel.the greatest moment for the torcida came in 1976, during "invasão corintiana",  in a memorable semi-final against fluminense, camisa 12 actively participated.
when over 70,000 corinthians fans from são paulo made the 280 mile trip to rio de janeiro's maracana stadium with scores of flags, banners, & percussion ensembles.
the attendance for that match was 147,000+.
motto: "preso por uma só paixão" (holded by a single passion)it was founded on september 9, 1990 by nine timão fans in honor of the team football carandiru house of detention.
the symbol adopted was from the disney cartoon ducktales of its antagonists the beagle boys.
the torcida grew out of a social program carried out in carandiru penitentiary, once the largest prison in latin american (now demolished) & site of the carandiru massacre.
where a group of friends, young fans of corinthians, formed a team and promoting a charity football match against a team of carandiru detainees,  mainly composed of corinthians supporters, all from the ninth pavilion of the institution, hence its name.
this group, through raffles, promotions and sports culture contributions, began to raise funds for the making banners and flags to divulge its philosophy on games in the stadiums of the corinthians.
the idea of creating an organized torcida was and to mature on september 9, 1990 officially became a corinthians organized torcida, christened the pavilion nine.
motto: "raça e atitude" (bravery & demeanor)
motto: "a mais fanática do interior" (the most fanatical in the interior)fiel macabra, founded on october 4, 1993 in bauru, sp.
this torcida was founded by a group of friends that regularly met in bauru cafeteria.
after its initial 3 years, it opened an official headquarter in bauru, with 5 other offices following soon at the interior of são paulo.
with about 1,800 members, it is the team's largest ultras in the interior of são paulo.
motto: "torcer e beber pelo corinthians" (drink & root for corinthians)coringão chopp, founded on october 14, 1989. this torcida's origins begin in the 1980s on a greater são paulo courtyard.
the local was frequented by a group of friends who met casually to play street football & drink beers together after corinthians games.
in 1989, these friends decided frequent corinthians matches as a unit, they began by going in separate cars.
that year their group of friends grew, all them from greater são paulo, mainly the abc region & their courtyard became a "meeting point" for the masses of new friends.
that same year, the owner of the courtyard known as dinho was discussing the sheer volume of corinthians fans that considered his courtyard as a pre-match meeting point.
it was that moment when dinho & friends realized that they had the numbers to create an organized torcida.
the members of the newly created torcida, reached a simple agreement on what to name themselves.
they agreed that they both had a passion for corinthians & chopp (draught beer).
after years of growth in membership, respect, & acceptance, the torcida moved out of the courtyard & set up a headquarters in diadema.
many of the torcidas above have sub-sedes (branch offices) established by fans living outside of são paulo.
gavioes in particular has 10, 8 in-state, 1 out-of-state brasilia, & 1 international japan.
camisa 12 with 8, 6 in-state, 2 out-of-state minas gerais & espírito santo.
pavilhão nove with 10, 9 in-state, 1 out-of-state mato grosso do sul.
estopim da fiel with 10, 8 in-state, 2 out-of-state parana & minas gerais.
fiel macabra with 6, 5 in-state, 1 out-of-state rio grande do sul.
coringão chopp with 5, all in-state.

corinthians' official mascot is the musketeer, a symbol of bravery, audacity and fighting spirit.
the adoption of that character recalls the first years of the club.
in 1913 most of the leading football clubs in são paulo state founded the apea (paulista athletic sports association).
the depleted paulista league was left with only americano, germania and internacional, known as the "three musketeers" of são paulo football.
corinthians joined the three as d'artagnan, being the fourth and most adored musketeer, just like in alexandre dumas, père's novel the three musketeers.
to be accepted in that "musketeers universe",
corinthians had to show their bravery.
as there was many other teams who coveted the spot in the liga paulista, corinthians participated in a selective tournament against minas gerais and são paulo, two other great teams of paulista amateur football at that time.
the corinthian team beat minas 1–0 and são paulo 4–0, earning acceptance into the group and acquiring the right to participate in the special division of the paulista league in the following year.
an important symbol for corinthians is saint george/(ogum).
saint george is one of the most revered catholic saints in brazil, a nation with a blend of cultures.
the collusion between african & european cultures is seen in brazil's definition of são jorge as a mash between catholicism & western african mythology.
the comparison may be drawn the entities similar characteristics; st george, the soldier who protects those who pray to him; ogum god of war who serves the communities who believe in him.
it is this warrior demeanor that made corinthians fans indebted to são jorge.
corinthians began as a small team for the lower classes of são paulo, even though they obtained initial success.
lack of respect for the working class by forced corinthians to leave their são paulo state football league in protest.
after multiple championships timão made its largest leap in prestige in the founding of a corinthians' headquarters, 1926.  the creation of said headquarters became the first fusion of timão & são jorge.
the land purchased for the headquarters was formerly parque são jorge (st. george park) at 777 rua são jorge, tatuapé, são paulo, sp.
corinthians support for são jorge became fanatical during the decade of the 60's, between 1954 and 1977, corinthians failed to add to its gallery of conquests and the corinthian nation lived the hardest moments of its history.
while the stream struggled in the 60's, fan recanted that they were blessed by a "santo guerreiro" (warrior saint).
in the early 60's the lack of success lingered in the minds of fans & gave birth to a utilization of the blessings of são jorge.
this caused corinthians to erect a chapel in honor of the saint, in order to strengthen the clubs resolve via mysticism.
1969, after the death of two players lidu & eduardo, the funeral was held in capela são jorge, & strengthened the clubs identity at a time when championships were non-existent.
1974 paulista final, after a heart-wrenching loss to arch-rival palmeiras,  composer paulinho nogueira recorded "oh corinthians", a song that had popular commercial success at the time.
in the verses of the composition dedicated to the suffering corinthians could not miss the quote to the patron saint george:
"...oh, são 20 anos de espera.
mas meu são jorge me dê forças, para poder um dia enfim, descontar meu sofrimento em quem riu de mim".("...
oh, it's been 20 years of waiting, but my st. george gives me strength to be able to one day finally cashing in my suffering upon those who laughed at me.)"
corinthians 2011 third kit, was burgundy colored & featured são jorge slaughtering a dragon in a dark watermark across the right side of the chest.
the utilization of são jorge's image on the shirt is the practice of são jorge's prayer.
derby paulista is a crosstown fixture between corinthians and palmeiras, consistently cited as one of the greatest rivalries worldwide by sources including  fifa, cnn, and the daily mail.
palmeiras was founded by a group of italians who were formerly members of corinthians.
since 1914, when that treasonous act was taken upon these former supporters, a deep-seated hatred was born.
the derby atmosphere is fierce on and off the pitch, as violence is a norm between the clubs.
clássico majestoso is a crosstown fixture between corinthians and são paulo.
the derby dates back to 1935, at the final re-founding são paulo after being thrice defunct.
corinthians possesses the largest number of supporters in the state (25 million), whereas são paulo's lies in second place (16 million).
the clássico's most memorable match for corinthians is the 1990 campenato brasileiro finals, which led to corinthians first national title.
clássico alvinegro is a regional fixture between corinthians and santos.
'alvinegro' is given after the colors worn by both teams, black and white (alvi, from latin albus, white, and negro, black).
the classico reached one of its highest stages for corinthians supporters when corinthians met santos in the semi-finals of libertadores 2012. corinthians won 2-1 on aggregate.
derby dos invictos (derby of the undefeated), corinthians and portuguesa is a crosstown rivalry.
corinthians vs ponte preta is an in-state rivalry that peaked in the 1977 campeonato paulista final, which led to ponte preta's greatest paulista finish (runner-up).
classico das multidões (classic of the masses) is an inter-state rivalry pegging the two most supported teams in brazil: corinthians and flamengo.
corinthians and vasco led to great match ups and some rivalry recently, mostly after vasco winning the brasileirão in 1997 and 2000, and corinthians in 1998 and 1999. their greatest match coincided with the first fifa club world cup in 2000, with a corinthians victory in the penalty shootout.
corinthians also won the 2011 brasileirão in the last round of the season, two points over the runners-up vasco.
corinthians saved vasco from their usual runner-up fate by defeating the cariocas in 2012 libertadores quarter-finals.

thomas alva edison (february 11, 1847 – october 18, 1931) was an american inventor and businessman who has been described as america's greatest inventor.
he developed many devices in fields such as electric power generation, mass communication, sound recording, and motion pictures.
these inventions, which include the phonograph, the motion picture camera, and the long-lasting, practical electric light bulb, have had a widespread impact on the modern industrialized world.
he was one of the first inventors to apply the principles of organized science and teamwork to the process of invention, working with many researchers and employees.
he established the first industrial research laboratory.
edison was raised in the american midwest; early in his career he worked as a telegraph operator, which inspired some of his earliest inventions.
in 1876, he established his first laboratory facility in menlo park, new jersey, where many of his early inventions were developed.
he later established a botanic laboratory in fort myers, florida in collaboration with businessmen henry ford and harvey firestone, and a laboratory in west orange, new jersey that featured the world's first film studio, the black maria.
he was a prolific inventor, holding 1,093 us patents in his name, as well as patents in other countries.
edison married twice and fathered six children.
he died in 1931 of complications of diabetes.
thomas edison was born in 1847 in milan, ohio, and grew up in port huron, michigan.
he was the seventh and last child of samuel ogden edison jr. (1804–1896, born in marshalltown, nova scotia) and nancy matthews elliott (1810–1871, born in chenango county, new york).
his father, the son of a loyalist refugee, had moved as a boy with the family from nova scotia, settling in southwestern ontario (then called upper canada), in a village known as shrewsbury, later vienna, by 1811. samuel jr. eventually fled ontario, because he took part in the unsuccessful mackenzie rebellion of 1837. his father, samuel sr., had earlier fought in the war of 1812 as captain of the first middlesex regiment.
by contrast, samuel jr.'s struggle found him on the losing side, and he crossed into the united states at sarnia-port huron.
once across the border, he found his way to milan, ohio.
his patrilineal family line was dutch by way of new jersey; the surname had originally been "edeson."
edison attended school for only a few months, and was instead taught by his mother.
much of his education came from reading r. g. parker's school of natural philosophy and from enrolling in chemistry courses at the cooper union for the advancement of science and art.
edison developed hearing problems at an early age.
the cause of his deafness has been attributed to a bout of scarlet fever during childhood and recurring untreated middle-ear infections.
around halfway through his career, edison attributed the hearing impairment to being struck on the ears by a train conductor when his chemical laboratory in a boxcar caught fire and he was thrown off the train in smiths creek, michigan, along with his apparatus and chemicals.
in his later years, he modified the story to say the injury occurred when the conductor, in helping him onto a moving train, lifted him by the ears.
being completely deaf in one ear and barely hearing in the other, edison would listen to a music player or piano by chomping into the wood to absorb the sound waves into his skull.
the waves would then pass through the cochlea and into the auditory nerve and finally into his brain.
due to this method of listening, he could not stand vocal vibrato nor hear at the highest frequencies.
edison's family moved to port huron, michigan after the canal owners successfully kept the railroad out of milan, ohio in 1854 and business declined.
edison sold candy and newspapers on trains running from port huron to detroit, and sold vegetables.
although he frustrated teachers and went in and out of various schools in ohio and michigan, he read steadily and voraciously under his mother's supervision.
he turned a $50 a week profit by age 13, most of which went to buying equipment for electric and chemical experiments.
he became a telegraph operator after he saved three-year-old jimmie mackenzie from being struck by a runaway train.
jimmie's father, station agent j. u. mackenzie of mount clemens, michigan, was so grateful that he trained edison as a telegraph operator.
edison's first telegraphy job away from port huron was at stratford junction, ontario, on the grand trunk railway.
he was held responsible for a near collision.
he also studied qualitative analysis and conducted chemical experiments on the train until he left the job.
edison obtained the exclusive right to sell newspapers on the road, and, with the aid of four assistants, he set in type and printed the grand trunk herald, which he sold with his other papers.
this began edison's long streak of entrepreneurial ventures, as he discovered his talents as a businessman.
these talents eventually led him to found 14 companies, including general electric, still one of the largest publicly traded companies in the world.
in 1866, at the age of 19, edison moved to louisville, kentucky, where, as an employee of western union, he worked the associated press bureau news wire.
edison requested the night shift, which allowed him plenty of time to spend at his two favorite pastimes—reading and experimenting.
eventually, the latter pre-occupation cost him his job.
one night in 1867, he was working with a lead–acid battery when he spilled sulfuric acid onto the floor.
it ran between the floorboards and onto his boss's desk below.
the next morning edison was fired.
his first patent was for the electric vote recorder, u.s. patent 90,646, which was granted on june 1, 1869. finding little demand for the machine, edison moved to new york city shortly thereafter.
one of his mentors during those early years was a fellow telegrapher and inventor named franklin leonard pope, who allowed the impoverished youth to live and work in the basement of his elizabeth, new jersey, home, while edison worked for samuel laws at the gold indicator company.
pope and edison founded their own company in october 1869, working as electrical engineers and inventors.
edison began developing a multiplex telegraphic system, which could send two messages simultaneously, in 1874.
edison's major innovation was the establishment of an industrial research lab in 1876. it was built in menlo park, a part of raritan township (now named edison township in his honor) in middlesex county, new jersey, with the funds from the sale of edison's quadruplex telegraph.
after his demonstration of the telegraph, edison was not sure that his original plan to sell it for $4,000 to $5,000 was right, so he asked western union to make a bid.
he was surprised to hear them offer $10,000 ($226,000 in today's dollars), which he gratefully accepted.
the quadruplex telegraph was edison's first big financial success, and menlo park became the first institution set up with the specific purpose of producing constant technological innovation and improvement.
edison was legally attributed with most of the inventions produced there, though many employees carried out research and development under his direction.
his staff was generally told to carry out his directions in conducting research, and he drove them hard to produce results.
william joseph hammer, a consulting electrical engineer, started working for edison and began his duties as a laboratory assistant in december 1879. he assisted in experiments on the telephone, phonograph, electric railway, iron ore separator, electric lighting, and other developing inventions.
however, hammer worked primarily on the incandescent electric lamp and was put in charge of tests and records on that device (see hammer historical collection of incandescent electric lamps).
in 1880, he was appointed chief engineer of the edison lamp works.
in his first year, the plant under general manager francis robbins upton turned out 50,000 lamps.
according to edison, hammer was "a pioneer of incandescent electric lighting".
frank j. sprague, a competent mathematician and former naval officer, was recruited by edward h. johnson and joined the edison organization in 1883. one of sprague's contributions to the edison laboratory at menlo park was to expand edison's mathematical methods.
despite the common belief that edison did not use mathematics, analysis of his notebooks reveal that he was an astute user of mathematical analysis conducted by his assistants such as francis robbins upton, for example, determining the critical parameters of his electric lighting system including lamp resistance by an analysis of ohm's law, joule's law and economics.
nearly all of edison's patents were utility patents, which were protected for 17 years and included inventions or processes that are electrical, mechanical, or chemical in nature.
about a dozen were design patents, which protect an ornamental design for up to 14 years.
as in most patents, the inventions he described were improvements over prior art.
the phonograph patent, in contrast, was unprecedented in describing the first device to record and reproduce sounds.
in just over a decade, edison's menlo park laboratory had expanded to occupy two city blocks.
edison said he wanted the lab to have "a stock of almost every conceivable material".
a newspaper article printed in 1887 reveals the seriousness of his claim, stating the lab contained "eight thousand kinds of chemicals, every kind of screw made, every size of needle, every kind of cord or wire, hair of humans, horses, hogs, cows, rabbits, goats, minx, camels ... silk in every texture, cocoons, various kinds of hoofs, shark's teeth, deer horns, tortoise shell ... cork, resin, varnish and oil, ostrich feathers, a peacock's tail, jet, amber, rubber, all ores ..." and the list goes on.
over his desk edison displayed a placard with sir joshua reynolds' famous quotation: "there is no expedient to which a man will not resort to avoid the real labor of thinking."
this slogan was reputedly posted at several other locations throughout the facility.
in menlo park, edison had created the first industrial laboratory concerned with creating knowledge and then controlling its application.
edison's name is registered on 1,093 patents.
edison began his career as an inventor in newark, new jersey, with the automatic repeater and his other improved telegraphic devices, but the invention that first gained him wider notice was the phonograph in 1877. this accomplishment was so unexpected by the public at large as to appear almost magical.
edison became known as "the wizard of menlo park," new jersey.
his first phonograph recorded on tinfoil around a grooved cylinder.
despite its limited sound quality and that the recordings could be played only a few times, the phonograph made edison a celebrity.
joseph henry, president of the national academy of sciences and one of the most renowned electrical scientists in the us, described edison as "the most ingenious inventor in this country... or in any other".
in april 1878, edison traveled to washington to demonstrate the phonograph before the national academy of sciences, congressmen, senators and us president hayes.
the washington post described edison as a "genius" and his presentation as "a scene... that will live in history".
although edison obtained a patent for the phonograph in 1878, he did little to develop it until alexander graham bell, chichester bell, and charles tainter produced a phonograph-like device in the 1880s that used wax-coated cardboard cylinders.
in 1876, edison began work to improve the microphone for telephones (at that time called a "transmitter") by developing a carbon microphone, which consists of two metal plates separated by granules of carbon that would change resistance with the pressure of sound waves.
a steady direct current is passed between the plates through the granules and the varying resistance results in a modulation of the current, creating a varying electric current that reproduces the varying pressure of the sound wave.
up to that point, microphones, such as the ones developed by johann philipp reis and alexander graham bell, worked by generating a weak current.
the carbon microphone works by modulating a direct current and, subsequently, using a transformer to transfer the signal so generated to the telephone line.
edison was one of many inventors working on the problem of creating a usable microphone for telephony by having it modulate an electrical current passed through it.
his work was concurrent with emile berliner's loose-contact carbon transmitter (who lost a later patent case against edison over the carbon transmitters invention) and david edward hughes study and published paper on the physics of loose-contact carbon transmitters (work that hughes did not bother to patent).
edison used the carbon microphone concept in 1877 to create an improved telephone for western union.
in 1886, edison found a way to improve a bell telephone microphone, one that used loose-contact ground carbon, with his discovery that it worked far better if the carbon was roasted.
this type was put in use in 1890 and was used in all telephones along with the bell receiver until the 1980s.
in 1878, edison began working on a system of electrical illumination, something he hoped could compete with gas and oil-based lighting.
he began by tackling the problem of creating a long-lasting incandescent lamp, something that would be needed for indoor use.
many earlier inventors had previously devised incandescent lamps, including alessandro volta's demonstration of a glowing wire in 1800 and inventions by henry woodward and mathew evans.
others who developed early and commercially impractical incandescent electric lamps included humphry davy, james bowman lindsay, moses g. farmer, william e. sawyer, joseph swan, and heinrich göbel.
some of these early bulbs had such flaws as an extremely short life, high expense to produce, and high electric current drawn, making them difficult to apply on a large scale commercially.
:217–218 edison realized that in order to keep the thickness of the copper wire needed to connect electric lights economically manageable he would have to develop a lamp that would draw a low amount of current.
this meant the lamp would have to have a high resistance.
after many experiments, first with carbon filaments and then with platinum and other metals, edison returned to a carbon filament.
the first successful test was on october 22, 1879;:186 it lasted 13.5 hours.
edison continued to improve this design and on november 4, 1879, filed for u.s. patent 223,898 (granted on january 27, 1880) for an electric lamp using "a carbon filament or strip coiled and connected to platina contact wires".
this was the first commercially practical incandescent light.
although the patent described several ways of creating the carbon filament including "cotton and linen thread, wood splints, papers coiled in various ways", it was not until several months after the patent was granted that edison and his team discovered a carbonized bamboo filament that could last over 1,200 hours.
the idea of using this particular raw material originated from edison's recalling his examination of a few threads from a bamboo fishing pole while relaxing on the shore of battle lake in the present-day state of wyoming, where he and other members of a scientific team had traveled so that they could clearly observe a total eclipse of the sun on july 29, 1878, from the continental divide.
in 1878, edison formed the edison electric light company in new york city with several financiers, including j. p. morgan, spencer trask, and the members of the vanderbilt family.
edison made the first public demonstration of his incandescent light bulb on december 31, 1879, in menlo park.
it was during this time that he said: "we will make electricity so cheap that only the rich will burn candles."
henry villard, president of the oregon railroad and navigation company, attended edison's 1879 demonstration.
villard was impressed and requested edison install his electric lighting system aboard villard's company's new steamer, the columbia.
although hesitant at first, edison agreed to villard's request.
most of the work was completed in may 1880, and the columbia went to new york city, where edison and his personnel installed columbia's new lighting system.
the columbia was edison's first commercial application for his incandescent light bulb.
the edison equipment was removed from columbia in 1895.
lewis latimer joined the edison electric light company in 1884. latimer had received a patent in january 1881 for the "process of manufacturing carbons", an improved method for the production of carbon filaments for light bulbs.
latimer worked as an engineer, a draftsman and an expert witness in patent litigation on electric lights.
george westinghouse's company bought philip diehl's competing induction lamp patent rights (1882) for $25,000, forcing the holders of the edison patent to charge a lower rate for the use of the edison patent rights and lowering the price of the electric lamp.
on october 8, 1883, the us patent office ruled that edison's patent was based on the work of william e. sawyer and was, therefore, invalid.
litigation continued for nearly six years, until october 6, 1889, when a judge ruled that edison's electric light improvement claim for "a filament of carbon of high resistance" was valid.
to avoid a possible court battle with joseph swan, whose british patent had been awarded a year before edison's, he and swan formed a joint company called ediswan to manufacture and market the invention in britain.
mahen theatre in brno (in what is now the czech republic), opened in 1882, and was the first public building in the world to use edison's electric lamps.
francis jehl, edison's assistant in the invention of the lamp, supervised the installation.
in september 2010, a sculpture of three giant light bulbs was erected in brno, in front of the theatre.
after devising a commercially viable electric light bulb on october 21, 1879, edison developed an electric "utility" to compete with the existing gas light utilities.
on december 17, 1880, he founded the edison illuminating company, and during the 1880s, he patented a system for electricity distribution.
the company established the first investor-owned electric utility in 1882 on pearl street station, new york city.
on september 4, 1882, edison switched on his pearl street generating station's electrical power distribution system, which provided 110 volts direct current (dc) to 59 customers in lower manhattan.
in january 1882, edison switched on the first steam-generating power station at holborn viaduct in london.
the dc supply system provided electricity supplies to street lamps and several private dwellings within a short distance of the station.
on january 19, 1883, the first standardized incandescent electric lighting system employing overhead wires began service in roselle, new jersey.
as edison expanded his direct current (dc) power delivery system, he received stiff competition from companies installing alternating current (ac) systems.
from the early 1880s, ac arc lighting systems for streets and large spaces had been an expanding business in the us.
with the development of transformers in europe and by westinghouse electric in the us in 1885–1886, it became possible to transmit ac long distances over thinner and cheaper wires, and "step down" the voltage at the destination for distribution to users.
this allowed ac to be used in street lighting and in lighting for small business and domestic customers, the market edison's patented low voltage dc incandescent lamp system was designed to supply.
edison's dc empire suffered from one of its chief drawbacks: it was suitable only for the high density of customers found in large cities.
edison's dc plants could not deliver electricity to customers more than one mile from the plant, and left a patchwork of unsupplied customers between plants.
small cities and rural areas could not afford an edison style system at all, leaving a large part of the market without electrical service.
ac companies expanded into this gap.
edison expressed views that ac was unworkable and the high voltages used were dangerous.
as george westinghouse installed his first ac systems in 1886, thomas edison struck out personally against his chief rival stating, "just as certain as death, westinghouse will kill a customer within six months after he puts in a system of any size.
he has got a new thing and it will require a great deal of experimenting to get it working practically."
many reasons have been suggested for edison's anti-ac stance.
one notion is that the inventor could not grasp the more abstract theories behind ac and was trying to avoid developing a system he did not understand.
edison also appeared to have been worried about the high voltage from misinstalled ac systems killing customers and hurting the sales of electric power systems in general.
primary was the fact that edison electric based their design on low voltage dc and switching a standard after they had installed over 100 systems was, in edison's mind, out of the question.
by the end of 1887, edison electric was losing market share to westinghouse, who had built 68 ac-based power stations to edison's 121 dc-based stations.
to make matters worse for edison, the thomson-houston electric company of lynn, massachusetts (another ac-based competitor) built 22 power stations.
parallel to expanding competition between edison and the ac companies was rising public furor over a series of deaths in the spring of 1888 caused by pole mounted high voltage alternating current lines.
this turned into a media frenzy against high voltage alternating current and the seemingly greedy and callous lighting companies that used it.
edison took advantage of the public perception of ac as dangerous, and joined with self-styled new york anti-ac crusader harold p. brown in a propaganda campaign, aiding brown in the public electrocution of animals with ac, and supported legislation to control and severely limit ac installations and voltages (to the point of making it an ineffective power delivery system) in what was now being referred to as a "battle of currents".
the development of the electric chair was used in an attempt to portray ac as having a greater lethal potential than dc and smear westinghouse at the same time via edison colluding with brown and westinghouse's chief ac rival, the thomson-houston electric company, to make sure the first electric chair was powered by a westinghouse ac generator.
thomas edison's staunch anti-ac tactics were not sitting well with his own stockholders.
by the early 1890s, edison's company was generating much smaller profits than its ac rivals, and the war of currents would come to an end in 1892 with edison forced out of controlling his own company.
that year, the financier j.p. morgan engineered a merger of edison general electric with thomson-houston that put the board of thomson-houston in charge of the new company called general electric.
general electric now controlled three-quarters of the us electrical business and would compete with westinghouse for the ac market.
edison moved from menlo park after the death of his first wife, mary, in 1884, and purchased a home known as "glenmont" in 1886 as a wedding gift for his second wife, mina, in llewellyn park in west orange, new jersey.
in 1885, thomas edison bought 13 acres of property in fort myers, florida, for roughly $2,750 and built what was later called seminole lodge as a winter retreat.
the main house and guest house are representative of italianate architecture and queen anne style architecture.
the building materials were pre-cut in new england by the kennebec framing company and the stephen nye lumber company of fairfield maine.
the materials were then shipped down by boat and were constructed at a cost of $12,000 each, which included the cost of interior furnishings.
edison and mina spent many winters at their home in fort myers, and edison tried to find a domestic source of natural rubber.
due to the security concerns around world war i, edison suggested forming a science and industry committee to provide advice and research to the us military, and he headed the naval consulting board in 1915.
edison became concerned with america's reliance on foreign supply of rubber and was determined to find a native supply of rubber.
edison's work on rubber took place largely at his research laboratory in fort myers, which has been designated as a national historic chemical landmark.
the laboratory was built after thomas edison, henry ford, and harvey firestone pulled together $75,000 to form the edison botanical research corporation.
initially, only ford and firestone were to contribute funds to the project while edison did all the research.
edison, however, wished to contribute $25,000 as well.
edison did the majority of the research and planting, sending results and sample rubber residues to his west orange lab.
edison employed a two-part acid-base extraction, to derive latex from the plant material after it was dried and crushed to a powder.
after testing 17,000 plant samples, he eventually found an adequate source in the goldenrod plant.
edison decided on solidago leavenworthii, also known as leavenworth's goldenrod.
the plant, which normally grows roughly 3–4 feet tall with a 5% latex yield, was adapted by edison through cross-breeding to produce plants twice the size and with a latex yield of 12%.
during the 1911 new york electrical show, edison told representatives of the copper industry it was a shame he didn't have a "chunk of it".
the representatives decided to give a cubic foot of solid copper weighing 486 pounds with their gratitude inscribed on it in appreciation for his part in the "continuous stimulation in the copper industry".
edison is credited with designing and producing the first commercially available fluoroscope, a machine that uses x-rays to take radiographs.
until edison discovered that calcium tungstate fluoroscopy screens produced brighter images than the barium platinocyanide screens originally used by wilhelm röntgen, the technology was capable of producing only very faint images.
the fundamental design of edison's fluoroscope is still in use today, although edison abandoned the project after nearly losing his own eyesight and seriously injuring his assistant, clarence dally.
dally made himself an enthusiastic human guinea pig for the fluoroscopy project and was exposed to a poisonous dose of radiation; he later died (at the age of 39) of injuries related to the exposure, mediastinal cancer.
in 1903, a shaken edison said: "don't talk to me about x-rays, i am afraid of them."
nonetheless, his work was important in the development of a technology still used today.
edison invented a highly sensitive device, that he named the tasimeter, which measured infrared radiation.
his impetus for its creation was the desire to measure the heat from the solar corona during the total solar eclipse of july 29, 1878. the device was not patented since edison could find no practical mass-market application for it.
the key to edison's fortunes was telegraphy.
with knowledge gained from years of working as a telegraph operator, he learned the basics of electricity.
this allowed him to make his early fortune with the stock ticker, the first electricity-based broadcast system.
on august 9, 1892, edison received a patent for a two-way telegraph.
edison was granted a patent for the motion picture camera or "kinetograph".
he did the electromechanical design while his employee william kennedy dickson, a photographer, worked on the photographic and optical development.
much of the credit for the invention belongs to dickson.
in 1891, thomas edison built a kinetoscope or peep-hole viewer.
this device was installed in penny arcades, where people could watch short, simple films.
the kinetograph and kinetoscope were both first publicly exhibited may 20, 1891.
in april 1896, thomas armat's vitascope, manufactured by the edison factory and marketed in edison's name, was used to project motion pictures in public screenings in new york city.
later, he exhibited motion pictures with voice soundtrack on cylinder recordings, mechanically synchronized with the film.
officially the kinetoscope entered europe when wealthy american businessman irving t. bush (1869–1948) bought from the continental commerce company of frank z. maguire and joseph d. baucus a dozen machines.
bush placed from october 17, 1894, the first kinetoscopes in london.
at the same time, the french company kinétoscope edison michel et alexis werner bought these machines for the market in france.
in the last three months of 1894, the continental commerce company sold hundreds of kinetoscopes in europe (i.e.
the netherlands and italy).
in germany and in austria-hungary, the kinetoscope was introduced by the deutsche-österreichische-edison-kinetoscop gesellschaft, founded by the ludwig stollwerck of the schokoladen-süsswarenfabrik stollwerck & co of cologne.
the first kinetoscopes arrived in belgium at the fairs in early 1895. the edison's kinétoscope français, a belgian company, was founded in brussels on january 15, 1895, with the rights to sell the kinetoscopes in monaco, france and the french colonies.
the main investors in this company were belgian industrialists.
on may 14, 1895, the edison's kinétoscope belge was founded in brussels.
businessman ladislas-victor lewitzki, living in london but active in belgium and france, took the initiative in starting this business.
he had contacts with leon gaumont and the american mutoscope and biograph co. in 1898, he also became a shareholder of the biograph and mutoscope company for france.
edison's film studio made nearly 1,200 films.
the majority of the productions were short films showing everything from acrobats to parades to fire calls including titles such as fred ott's sneeze (1894), the kiss (1896), the great train robbery (1903), alice's adventures in wonderland (1910), and the first frankenstein film in 1910. in 1903, when the owners of luna park, coney island announced they would execute topsy the elephant by strangulation, poisoning, and electrocution (with the electrocution part ultimately killing the elephant), edison manufacturing sent a crew to film it, releasing it that same year with the title electrocuting an elephant.
as the film business expanded, competing exhibitors routinely copied and exhibited each other's films.
to better protect the copyrights on his films, edison deposited prints of them on long strips of photographic paper with the u.s. copyright office.
many of these paper prints survived longer and in better condition than the actual films of that era.
in 1908, edison started the motion picture patents company, which was a conglomerate of nine major film studios (commonly known as the edison trust).
thomas edison was the first honorary fellow of the acoustical society of america, which was founded in 1929.
edison said his favorite movie was the birth of a nation.
he thought that talkies had "spoiled everything" for him.
"there isn't any good acting on the screen.
they concentrate on the voice now and have forgotten how to act.
i can sense it more than you because i am deaf."
his favorite stars were mary pickford and clara bow.
starting in the late 1870s, edison became interested and involved with mining.
high-grade iron ore was scarce on the east coast of the united states and edison tried to mine low-grade ore. edison developed a process using rollers and crushers that could pulverize rocks up to 10 tons.
the dust was then sent between three giant magnets that would pull the iron ore from the dust.
despite the failure of his mining company, the edison ore milling company, edison used some of the materials and equipment to produce cement.
in 1901, edison visited an industrial exhibition in the sudbury area in ontario, canada and thought nickel and cobalt deposits there could be used in his production of electrical equipment.
he returned as a mining prospector and is credited with the original discovery of the falconbridge ore body.
his attempts to mine the ore body were not successful, and he abandoned his mining claim in 1903. a street in falconbridge, as well as the edison building, which served as the head office of falconbridge mines, are named for him.
in the late 1890s edison worked on developing a lighter, more efficient rechargeable battery (at that time called an "accumulator").
he looked on them as something customers could use to power their phonographs but saw other uses for an improved battery, including electric automobiles.
the then available lead acid rechargeable batteries were not very efficient and that market was already tied up by other companies so edison pursued using alkaline instead of acid.
he had his lab work on many types of materials (going through some 10,000 combinations), eventually settling on a nickel-iron combination.
besides his experimenting edison also probably had access to the 1899 patents for a nickel–iron battery by the swedish inventor waldemar jungner.
edison obtained a us and european patent for his nickel–iron battery in 1901 and founded the edison storage battery company and by 1904 it had 450 people working there.
the first rechargeable batteries they produced were for electric cars, but there were many defects with customers complaining about the product.
when the capital of the company was spent, edison paid for the company with his private money.
edison did not demonstrate a mature product until 1910: a very efficient and durable nickel-iron-battery with lye as the electrolyte.
the nickel–iron battery was never very successful, by the time it was ready electric cars were disappearing and lead acid batteries had become the standard for tuning over gas powered car starter motors.
at the start of world war i, the american chemical industry was primitive.
most chemicals were imported from europe.
the outbreak of war in august 1914, resulted in an immediate shortage of imported chemicals.
one of particular importance to edison was phenol, which was used to make phonograph records—presumably as phenolic resins of the bakelite type.
at the time, phenol came from coal as a by-product of coke oven gases or manufactured gas for gas lighting.
phenol could be nitrated to picric acid and converted to ammonium picrate, a shock resistant high explosive suitable for use in artillery shells.
the best telling[according to whom?]
of the phenol story is found in the aspirin wars.
most phenol had been imported from britain, but with war, parliament blocked exports and diverted most to production of ammonium picrate.
britain also blockaded supplies from germany.
edison responded by undertaking production of phenol at his silver lake, facility using processes developed by his chemists.
he built two plants with a capacity of six tons of phenol per day.
production began the first week of september, one month after hostilities began in europe.
he built two plants to produce raw material benzene at johnstown, pennsylvania, and bessemer, alabama, replacing supplies previously from germany.
edison also manufactured aniline dyes, which previously had been supplied by the german dye trust.
other wartime products include xylene, p-phenylenediamine, shellac, and pyrax.
wartime shortages made these ventures profitable.
in 1915, his production capacity was fully committed by midyear.
phenol was a critical material because two derivatives were in high growth phases.
bakelite, the original thermoset plastic, had been invented in 1909. aspirin, too was a phenol derivative.
invented in 1899 had become a block buster drug.
bayer had acquired a plant to manufacture in the us in rensselaer, new york, but struggled to find phenol to keep their plant running during the war.
edison was able to oblige.
bayer relied on chemische fabrik von heyden, in piscataway, new jersey, to convert phenol to salicylic acid, which they converted to aspirin.
(see great phenol plot.)
it is said that german companies bought up supplies of phenol to block production of ammonium picrate.
edison preferred not to sell phenol for military uses.
he sold his surplus to bayer, who had it converted to salicylic acid by heyden, some of which was exported.
henry ford, the automobile magnate, later lived a few hundred feet away from edison at his winter retreat in fort myers.
ford once worked as an engineer for the edison illuminating company of detroit and met edison at a convention of affiliated edison illuminating companies in brooklyn, ny in 1896. edison was impressed with ford's internal combustion engine automobile and encouraged its developments.
they were friends until edison's death.
edison and ford undertook annual motor camping trips from 1914 to 1924. harvey firestone and naturalist john burroughs also participated.
in 1928, edison joined the fort myers civitan club.
he believed strongly in the organization, writing that "the civitan club is doing things—big things—for the community, state, and nation, and i certainly consider it an honor to be numbered in its ranks."
he was an active member in the club until his death, sometimes bringing henry ford to the club's meetings.
edison was active in business right up to the end.
just months before his death, the lackawanna railroad inaugurated suburban electric train service from hoboken to montclair, dover, and gladstone, new jersey.
electrical transmission for this service was by means of an overhead catenary system using direct current, which edison had championed.
despite his frail condition, edison was at the throttle of the first electric mu (multiple-unit) train to depart lackawanna terminal in hoboken in september 1930, driving the train the first mile through hoboken yard on its way to south orange.
this fleet of cars would serve commuters in northern new jersey for the next 54 years until their retirement in 1984. a plaque commemorating edison's inaugural ride can be seen today in the waiting room of lackawanna terminal in hoboken, which is presently operated by new jersey transit.
edison was said to have been influenced by a popular fad diet in his last few years; "the only liquid he consumed was a pint of milk every three hours".
he is reported to have believed this diet would restore his health.
however, this tale is doubtful.
in 1930, the year before edison died, mina said in an interview about him, "correct eating is one of his greatest hobbies."
she also said that during one of his periodic "great scientific adventures", edison would be up at 7:00, have breakfast at 8:00, and be rarely home for lunch or dinner, implying that he continued to have all three.
edison became the owner of his milan, ohio, birthplace in 1906. on his last visit, in 1923, he was reportedly shocked to find his old home still lit by lamps and candles.
[citation needed]
edison died of complications of diabetes on october 18, 1931, in his home, "glenmont" in llewellyn park in west orange, new jersey, which he had purchased in 1886 as a wedding gift for mina.
rev.
stephen j. herben officiated at the funeral; edison is buried behind the home.
edison's last breath is reportedly contained in a test tube at the henry ford museum near detroit.
ford reportedly convinced charles edison to seal a test tube of air in the inventor's room shortly after his death, as a memento.
a plaster death mask and casts of edison's hands were also made.
mina died in 1947.
on december 25, 1871, at the age of 24, edison married 16-year-old mary stilwell (1855–1884), whom he had met two months earlier; she was an employee at one of his shops.
they had three children:
mary edison died at age 29 on august 9, 1884, of unknown causes: possibly from a brain tumor or a morphine overdose.
doctors frequently prescribed morphine to women in those years to treat a variety of causes, and researchers believe that her symptoms could have been from morphine poisoning.
edison generally preferred spending time in the laboratory to being with his family.
on february 24, 1886, at the age of 39, edison married the 20-year-old mina miller (1865–1947) in akron, ohio.
she was the daughter of the inventor lewis miller, co-founder of the chautauqua institution, and a benefactor of methodist charities.
they also had three children together:
mina outlived thomas edison, dying on august 24, 1947.
wanting to be an inventor, but not having much of an aptitude for it, thomas edison's son, thomas alva edison jr.. became a problem for his father and his father's business.
starting in the 1890s, thomas jr. became involved in snake oil products and shady and fraudulent enterprises producing products being sold to the public as "the latest edison discovery".
the situation became so bad that thomas sr. had to take his son to court to stop the practices, finally agreeing to pay thomas jr. an allowance of $35.00 (equivalent to $996 in 2019) per week, in exchange for not using the edison name; the son began using aliases, such as burton willard.
thomas jr., suffering from alcoholism, depression and ill health, worked at several menial jobs, but by 1931 (towards the end of his life) he would obtain a role in the edison company, thanks to the intervention of his brother.
historian paul israel has characterized edison as a "freethinker".
edison was heavily influenced by thomas paine's the age of reason.
edison defended paine's "scientific deism", saying, "he has been called an atheist, but atheist he was not.
paine believed in a supreme intelligence, as representing the idea which other men often express by the name of deity."
in 1878, edison joined the theosophical society in new jersey, but according to its founder, h. p. blavatsky, he was not a very active member.
in an october 2, 1910, interview in the new york times magazine, edison stated:
nature is what we know.
we do not know the gods of religions.
and nature is not kind, or merciful, or loving.
if god made me—the fabled god of the three qualities of which i spoke: mercy, kindness, love—he also made the fish i catch and eat.
and where do his mercy, kindness, and love for that fish come in?
no; nature made us—nature did it all—not the gods of the religions.
edison was accused of being an atheist for those remarks, and although he did not allow himself to be drawn into the controversy publicly, he clarified himself in a private letter:
you have misunderstood the whole article, because you jumped to the conclusion that it denies the existence of god.
there is no such denial, what you call god i call nature, the supreme intelligence that rules matter.
all the article states is that it is doubtful in my opinion if our intelligence or soul or whatever one may call it lives hereafter as an entity or disperses back again from whence it came, scattered amongst the cells of which we are made.
he also stated, "i do not believe in the god of the theologians; but that there is a supreme intelligence i do not doubt."
nonviolence was key to edison's moral views, and when asked to serve as a naval consultant for world war i, he specified he would work only on defensive weapons and later noted, "i am proud of the fact that i never invented weapons to kill."
edison's philosophy of nonviolence extended to animals as well, about which he stated: "nonviolence leads to the highest ethics, which is the goal of all evolution.
until we stop harming all other living beings, we are still savages."
he was a vegetarian but not a vegan in actual practice, at least near the end of his life.
in 1920, edison set off a media sensation when he told b. c. forbes of american magazine that he was working on a "spirit phone" to allow communication with the dead, a story which other newspapers and magazines repeated.
edison later disclaimed the idea, telling the new york times in 1926 that "i really had nothing to tell him, but i hated to disappoint him so i thought up this story about communicating with spirits, but it was all a joke."
thomas edison was an advocate for monetary reform in the united states.
he was ardently opposed to the gold standard and debt-based money.
famously, he was quoted in the new york times stating "gold is a relic of julius caesar, and interest is an invention of satan."
in the same article, he expounded upon the absurdity of a monetary system in which the taxpayer of the united states, in need of a loan, can be compelled to pay in return perhaps double the principal, or even greater sums, due to interest.
his basic point was that, if the government can produce debt-based money, it could equally as well produce money that was a credit to the taxpayer.
he thought at length about the subject of money in 1921 and 1922. in may 1922, he published a proposal, entitled "a proposed amendment to the federal reserve banking system".
in it, he detailed an explanation of a commodity-backed currency, in which the federal reserve would issue interest-free currency to farmers, based on the value of commodities they produced.
during a publicity tour that he took with friend and fellow inventor, henry ford, he spoke publicly about his desire for monetary reform.
for insight, he corresponded with prominent academic and banking professionals.
in the end, however, edison's proposals failed to find support and were eventually abandoned.
the president of the third french republic, jules grévy, on the recommendation of his minister of foreign affairs, jules barthélemy-saint-hilaire, and with the presentations of the minister of posts and telegraphs, louis cochery, designated edison with the distinction of an officer of the legion of honour (légion d'honneur) by decree on november 10, 1881; edison was also named a chevalier in the legion in 1879, and a commander in 1889.
in 1887, edison won the matteucci medal.
in 1890, he was elected a member of the royal swedish academy of sciences.
the philadelphia city council named edison the recipient of the john scott medal in 1889.
in 1899, edison was awarded the edward longstreth medal of the franklin institute.
he was named an honorable consulting engineer at the louisiana purchase exposition world's fair in 1904.
in 1908, edison received the american association of engineering societies john fritz medal.
in 1915, edison was awarded franklin medal of the franklin institute for discoveries contributing to the foundation of industries and the well-being of the human race.
in 1920, the united states navy department awarded him the navy distinguished service medal.
in 1923, the american institute of electrical engineers created the edison medal and he was its first recipient.
in 1927, he was granted membership in the national academy of sciences.
on may 29, 1928, edison received the congressional gold medal.
in 1983, the united states congress, pursuant to senate joint resolution 140 (public law 97–198), designated february 11, edison's birthday, as national inventor's day.
life magazine (usa), in a special double issue in 1997, placed edison first in the list of the "100 most important people in the last 1000 years", noting that the light bulb he promoted "lit up the world".
in the 2005 television series the greatest american, he was voted by viewers as the fifteenth greatest.
in 2008, edison was inducted in the new jersey hall of fame.
in 2010, edison was honored with a technical grammy award.
in 2011, edison was inducted into the entrepreneur walk of fame and named a great floridian by the governor and cabinet of florida.
several places have been named after edison, most notably the town of edison, new jersey.
thomas edison state university, nationally known for adult learners, is in trenton, new jersey.
two community colleges are named for him: edison state college (now florida southwestern state college) in fort myers, florida, andedison community college in piqua, ohio.
there are numerous high schools named after edison (see edison high school) and other schools including thomas a. edison middle school.

in beaumont, texas, there is an edison museum, though edison never visited there.the port huron museum, in port huron, michigan, restored the original depot that thomas edison worked out of as a young news butcher.
the depot has been named the thomas edison depot museum.
the town has many edison historical landmarks, including the graves of edison's parents, and a monument along the st. clair river.
edison's influence can be seen throughout this city of 32,000.
in detroit, the edison memorial fountain in grand circus park was created to honor his achievements.
the limestone fountain was dedicated october 21, 1929, the fiftieth anniversary of the creation of the light bulb.
on the same night, the edison institute was dedicated in nearby dearborn.
he was inducted into the automotive hall of fame in 1969.
[citation needed]
a bronze statue of edison was placed in the national statuary hall collection at the united states capitol in 2016, with the formal dedication ceremony held on september 20 of that year.
the edison statue replaced one of 19th-century state governor william allen that had been one of ohio's two allowed contributions to the collection.
the edison medal was created on february 11, 1904, by a group of edison's friends and associates.
four years later the american institute of electrical engineers (aiee), later ieee, entered into an agreement with the group to present the medal as its highest award.
the first medal was presented in 1909 to elihu thomson.
it is the oldest award in the area of electrical and electronics engineering, and is presented annually "for a career of meritorious achievement in electrical science, electrical engineering or the electrical arts."

in 1962, the navy commissioned uss thomas a. edison (ssbn-610), a fleet ballistic missile nuclear-powered submarine.
thomas edison has appeared in popular culture as a character in novels, films, comics and video games.
his prolific inventing helped make him an icon and he has made appearances in popular culture during his lifetime down to the present day.
edison is also portrayed in popular culture as an adversary of nikola tesla.
on february 11, 2011, on what would have been thomas edison's 164th birthday, google's homepage featured an animated google doodle commemorating his many inventions.
when the cursor was hovered over the doodle, a series of mechanisms seemed to move, causing a light bulb to glow.

luís vaz de camões (portuguese pronunciation: [luˈiʒ ˈvaʒ dɨ kaˈmõjʃ]; sometimes rendered in english as camoens or camoëns, e.g.
by byron in english bards and scotch reviewers, /ˈkæm oʊˌənz/; c. 1524 or 1525 – 20 june [o.s.
10 june] 1580) is considered portugal's and the portuguese language's greatest poet.
his mastery of verse has been compared to that of shakespeare, vondel, homer, virgil and dante.
he wrote a considerable amount of lyrical poetry and drama but is best remembered for his epic work os lusíadas (the lusiads).
his collection of poetry the parnasum of luís de camões was lost in his lifetime.
the influence of his masterpiece os lusíadas is so profound that portuguese is sometimes called the "language of camões".
many details concerning the life of camões remain unknown, but he is thought to have been born around 1524. luís vaz de camões was the only child of simão vaz de camões and wife ana de sá de macedo.
his birthplace is unknown.
lisbon, coimbra or alenquer are frequently presented as his birthplace, although the latter is based on a disputable interpretation of one of his poems.
constância is also considered a possibility as his place of birth: a statue of him can be found in the town.
camões belonged to a family originating from the northern portuguese region of chaves near galicia.
at an early age, his father simão vaz left his family to pursue personal riches in india, only to die in goa in the following years.
his mother later remarried.
camões lived a semi-privileged life and was educated by dominicans and jesuits.
for a period, due to his familial relations he attended the university of coimbra, although records do not show him registered (he participated in courses in the humanities).
his uncle, bento de camões, is credited with this education, owing to his position as prior at the monastery of santa cruz and chancellor at the university of coimbra.
he frequently had access to exclusive literature, including classical greek, roman and latin works;  he read latin and italian, and wrote poetry in spanish.
camões, as his love of poetry can attest, was a romantic and idealist.
it was rumored that he fell in love with catherine of ataíde, lady-in-waiting to the queen, and also princess maria, sister of john iii of portugal.
it is also likely that an indiscreet allusion to the king in his play el-rei seleuco, as well as these other incidents, may have played a part in his exile from lisbon in 1548. he traveled to the ribatejo where he stayed in the company of friends who sheltered and fed him.
he stayed in the province for about six months.
he enlisted in the overseas militia, and traveled to ceuta in the fall of 1549. during a battle with the moors, he lost the sight in his right eye.
he returned to lisbon in 1551, a changed man, living a bohemian lifestyle.
in 1552, during the religious festival of corpus christi, in the largo do rossio, he injured gonçalo borges, a member of the royal stables.
camões was imprisoned.
his mother pleaded for his release, visiting royal ministers and the borges family for a pardon.
released, camões was ordered to pay 4,000 réis and serve three years in the militia in the orient.
he departed in 1553 for goa on board the são bento, commanded by fernão alves cabral.
the ship arrived six months later.
in goa, camões was imprisoned for debt.
he found goa "a stepmother to all honest men", and he studied local customs and mastered the local geography and history.
on his first expedition, he joined a battle along the malabar coast.
the battle was followed by skirmishes along the trading routes between egypt and india.
the fleet eventually returned to goa by november 1554. during his time ashore, he continued his writing publicly, as well as writing correspondence for the uneducated men of the fleet.
at the end of his obligatory service, he was given the position of chief warrant officer in macau.
he was charged with managing the properties of missing and deceased soldiers in the orient.
during this time he worked on his epic poem os lusíadas ("the lusiads") in a grotto.
he was later accused of misappropriations and traveled to goa to respond to the accusations of the tribunal.
during his return journey, near the mekong river along the cambodian coast, he was shipwrecked, saving his manuscript but losing his chinese lover, dinamene.
his shipwreck survival in the mekong delta was enhanced by the legendary detail that he succeeded in swimming ashore while holding aloft the manuscript of his still-unfinished epic.
in 1570 camões finally made it back to lisbon, where two years later he published os lusíadas, for which he was considered one of the most prominent iberian poets at the time.
in recompense for this poem or perhaps for services in the far east, he was granted a small royal pension (15000 réis) by the young and ill-fated king sebastian (ruled 1557–1578).
in 1578 he heard of the appalling defeat of the battle of alcácer quibir, where king sebastian was killed and the portuguese army destroyed.
the castilian troops were approaching lisbon[citation needed] when camões wrote to the captain general of lamego: "all will see that so dear to me was my country that i was content to die not only in it but with it".
camões died in lisbon in 1580, at the age of 56. the day of his death, 10 june os, is portugal's national day.
he is buried near vasco da gama in the jerónimos monastery in the parish of belém in lisbon.
cora coralina is the pseudonym of the brazilian writer and poet anna lins dos guimarães peixoto bretas (august 20, 1889 – april 10, 1985).
she is considered one of the most important brazilian writers.
her first book (poemas nos becos de goiás e estórias mais) was published in june 1965.
she spent her working life as a confectioner in a small bakery, and where she drew upon her experiences of rural brazilian culture to create her rich poetic prose, often featuring the brazilian countryside, and in particular focusing upon life of the citizens who lived in the small towns across the state of goiás.
anna lins dos guimarães peixoto bretas wrote under the pseudonym of cora coralina.
she was born on august 20, 1889 in the city of goiás and raised on the banks of the river assunção, and maintained a strong connection to the city throughout her life.
she was the daughter of francisco de paula lins dos guimarães peixoto, a prominent local desembargador (appellate judge) appointed by dom pedro ii, and jacyntha luiza do couto brandão.
cora first began to write poems in her early teenage years at around 14, and later attended the clube literário goiano of dona virgínia da luz vieira.
cora then married, and went to live in são paulo, where she raised six children.
in addition to running her busy family life, cora  also worked in a small bakery as confectioner specializing in cakes.
her work and family consumed much of her time, but she continued to write; however it would not be until the mid-1960s, following the death of her husband when she was 75 years old, that she came to publish these works, the first of which would be 'poemas dos becos de goiás e estórias mais'.
after her husband's death, she also dedicated her time to agricultural activities on a small estate in the interior of the state.
her most well-known publications are poemas dos becos de goías e estorias mais and estorias da casa velha da ponte.
she is especially well known for her writing on women's issues, life in the state of goiás, the poverty of northeastern brazilians, and the mythology of afro-brazilian rituals that many still practiced.
her poetry integrates many of the diverse cultures of brazil.
her contemporaries include argentine writer alfonsina storni, uruguayan writer juana de ibarbourou, and chilean poet gabriela mistral.
almost all of her books have had more than ten editions, and have continued to be reprinted in the years since her passing illustrating the continued popularity of her work; in addition to a number of posthumous volumes of her collected writings and personal stories.
in 1984, the brazilian union of writers named her the "literary personality of the year."
at the time, carlos drummond de andrade, a distinguished poet in brazil and one of the most well known writers in latin america, said: "i admire cora coralina and her mastery of living in a state of grace with her poetry.
her verse is like running waters, her lyricism has the power and delicacy of the natural world."
cora coralina's family house, where she lived in her childhood and her later years until her death in 1985, can be visited in the city of goiás.
it is located by the bridge over the vermelho river.
it is one of the earliest last buildings of goiás, and a typical 18th-century house; it inspired some of the most beautiful of her poems.
there is a small museum in the house to honour her.
kora corallina simone, 2012, a species of brazilian land snail is named in her honour.
on august 20, 2017, google celebrated her 128th birthday with a google doodle.

fernando antónio nogueira pessoa (portuguese: [fɨɾˈnɐ̃du pɨˈsoɐ]; 13 june 1888 – 30 november 1935) was a portuguese poet, writer, literary critic, translator, publisher and philosopher, described as one of the most significant literary figures of the 20th century and one of the greatest poets in the portuguese language.
he also wrote in and translated from english and french.
pessoa was a prolific writer, and not only under his own name, for he created approximately seventy-five others.
he did not call them all pseudonyms because he felt that some did not capture their true independent intellectual life and instead called them heteronyms.
these imaginary figures sometimes held unpopular or extreme views.
pessoa was born in lisbon on 13 june 1888. when pessoa was five, his father, joaquim de seabra pessôa, died of tuberculosis and the following year, on 2 january, his younger brother jorge, aged one, also died.
after the second marriage of his mother, maria magdalena pinheiro nogueira, proxy wedding to joão miguel dos santos rosa, fernando sailed with his mother for south africa in the beginning of 1896, to join his stepfather, a military officer appointed portuguese consul in durban, capital of the former british colony of natal.
later on, in 1918, pessoa wrote a letter in which refers:
there is only one event in the past which has both the definiteness and the importance required for rectification by direction; this is my father's death, which took place on 13 july 1893. my mother's second marriage (which took place on 30 december 1895) is another date which i can give with preciseness and it is important for me, not in itself, but in one of its results – the circumstance that, my stepfather becoming portuguese consul in durban (natal), i was educated there, this english education being a factor of supreme importance in my life, and, whatever my fate be, indubitably shaping it.
the dates of the voyages related to the above event are (as nearly as possible):
1st.
voyage to africa – left lisbon beginning january 1896.
return – left durban in the afternoon of 1st.
august 1901.
2nd.
voyage to africa – left lisbon about 20th.
september 1902.
return – left durban about 20th.
august 1905.
the young pessoa received his early education at st. joseph convent school, a catholic grammar school run by irish and french nuns.
he moved to the durban high school in april 1899, becoming fluent in english and developing an appreciation for english literature.
during the matriculation examination, held at the time by the university of the cape of good hope (forerunner of the university of cape town), in november 1903, he was awarded the recently created queen victoria memorial prize for best paper in english.
while preparing to enter university, he also attended the durban commercial high school during one year, taking night classes.
meanwhile, pessoa started writing short stories in english, some under the name of david merrick, many of which he left unfinished.
at the age of sixteen, the natal mercury (edition of 6 july 1904) published his poem "hillier did first usurp the realms of rhyme...", under the name of c. r. anon (anonymous), along with a brief introductory text: "i read with great amusement...".
in december, the durban high school magazine published his essay "macaulay".
from february to june 1905, in the section "the man in the moon", the natal mercury also published at least four sonnets by fernando pessoa: "joseph chamberlain", "to england i", "to england ii" and "liberty".
his poems often carried humorous versions of anon as the author's name.
pessoa started using pen names quite young.
the first one, still in his childhood, was chevalier de pas, supposedly a french noble.
in addition to charles robert anon and david merrick, the young writer also signed up, among other pen names, as horace james faber, alexander search, and other meaningful names.
in the preface to the book of disquiet, pessoa wrote about himself:
nothing had ever obliged him to do anything.
he had spent his childhood alone.
he never joined any group.
he never pursued a course of study.
he never belonged to a crowd.
the circumstances of his life were marked by that strange but rather common phenomenon – perhaps, in fact, it’s true for all lives – of being tailored to the image and likeness of his instincts, which tended towards inertia and withdrawal.
the young pessoa was described by a schoolfellow as follows:
i cannot tell you exactly how long i knew him, but the period during which i received most of my impressions of him was the whole of the year 1904 when we were at school together.
how old he was at this time i don’t know, but judge him to have 15 or 16.
[...]
he was pale and thin and appeared physically to be very imperfectly developed.
he had a narrow and contracted chest and was inclined to stoop.
he had a peculiar walk and some defect in his eyesight gave to his eyes also a peculiar appearance, the lids seemed to drop over the eyes.
[...]
he was regarded as a brilliant clever boy as, in spite of the fact that he had not spoken english in his early years, he had learned it so rapidly and so well that he had a splendid style in that language.
although younger than his schoolfellows of the same class he appeared to have no difficulty in keeping up with and surpassing them in work.
for one of his age, he thought much and deeply and in a letter to me once complained of "spiritual and material encumbrances of most especial adverseness".
[...]
he took no part in athletic sports of any kind and i think his spare time was spent on reading.
we generally considered that he worked far too much and that he would ruin his health by so doing.
ten years after his arrival, he sailed for lisbon via the suez canal on board the "herzog", leaving durban for good at the age of seventeen.
this journey inspired the poems "opiário" (dedicated to his friend, the poet and writer mário de sá-carneiro) published in march 1915, in orpheu nr.1 and "ode marítima" (dedicated to the futurist painter santa-rita) published in june 1915, in orpheu nr.2 by his heteronym álvaro de campos.
while his family remained in south africa, pessoa returned to lisbon in 1905 to study diplomacy.
after a period of illness, and two years of poor results, a student strike against the dictatorship of prime minister joão franco put an end to his formal studies.
pessoa became an autodidact, a devoted reader who spent a lot of time at the library.
in august 1907, he started working as a practitioner at  r.g.
dun & company, an american mercantile information agency (currently d&b, dun & bradstreet).
his grandmother died in september and left him a small inheritance, which he spent on setting up his own publishing house, the "empreza ibis".
the venture was not successful and closed down in 1910, but the name ibis, the sacred bird of ancient egypt and inventor of the alphabet in greek mythology, would remain an important symbolic reference for him.
pessoa returned to his uncompleted formal studies, complementing his british education with self-directed study of portuguese culture.
the pre-revolutionary atmosphere surrounding the assassination of king charles i and crown prince luís filipe in 1908, and the patriotic outburst resulting from the successful republican revolution in 1910, influenced the development of the budding writer; as did his step-uncle, henrique dos santos rosa, a poet and retired soldier, who introduced the young pessoa to portuguese poetry, notably the romantics and symbolists of the 19th century.
in 1912, fernando pessoa entered the literary world with a critical essay, published in the cultural journal a águia, which triggered one of the most important literary debates in the portuguese intellectual world of the 20th century: the polemic regarding a super-camões.
in 1915 a group of artists and poets, including fernando pessoa, mário de sá-carneiro and almada negreiros, created the literary magazine orpheu, which introduced modernist literature to portugal.
only two issues were published (jan–feb–mar and apr–may–jun 1915), the third failed to appear due to funding difficulties.
lost for many years, this issue was finally recovered and published in 1984.  among other writers and poets, orpheu published pessoa, orthonym, and the modernist heteronym, álvaro de campos.
along with the artist ruy vaz, pessoa also founded the art journal athena (1924–25), in which he published verses under the  heteronyms alberto caeiro and ricardo reis.
along with his profession, as free-lance commercial translator, fernando pessoa undertook intense activity as a writer, literary critic and political analyst, contributing to the journals and newspapers a águia (1912–13), a república (1913), theatro (1913), a renascença (1914), o raio (1914), a galera (1915), orpheu (1915), o jornal (1915), eh real!
(1915), exílio (1916), centauro (1916), a ideia nacional (1916), terra nossa (1916), o heraldo (1917), portugal futurista (1917), acção (1919–20), ressurreição (1920), contemporânea (1922–26), athena (1924–25), diário de lisboa (1924–35), revista de comércio e contabilidade (1926), sol (1926), o imparcial (1927), presença (1927–34), revista solução editora (1929–1931), notícias ilustrado (1928–30), girassol (1930), revolução (1932), descobrimento (1932), fama (1932–33), fradique (1934) and sudoeste (1935).
after his return to portugal, when he was seventeen, pessoa barely left his beloved city of lisbon, which inspired the poems "lisbon revisited" (1923 and 1926), under the heteronym álvaro de campos.
from 1905 to 1920, when his family returned from pretoria after the death of his stepfather, he lived in fifteen different locations in the city, moving from one rented room to another depending on his fluctuating finances and personal troubles.
pessoa adopted the detached perspective of the flâneur bernardo soares, another of his heteronyms.
this character was supposedly an accountant, working for vasques, the boss of an office located in douradores street.
soares also supposedly lived in the same downtown street, a world that pessoa knew quite well due to his long career as freelance correspondence translator.
indeed, from 1907 until his death in 1935, pessoa worked in twenty-one firms located in lisbon's downtown, sometimes in two or three of them simultaneously.
in the book of disquiet, bernardo soares describes some of those typical places and its "atmosphere".
in his daydream soliloquy he also wrote about lisbon in the first half of the 20th century.
soares describes crowds in the streets, buildings, shops, traffic, river tagus, the weather, and even its author, fernando pessoa:
fairly tall and thin, he must have been about thirty years old.
he hunched over terribly when sitting down but less so standing up, and he dressed with a carelessness that wasn’t entirely careless.
in his pale, uninteresting face there was a look of suffering that didn’t add any interest, and it was difficult to say just what kind of suffering this look suggested.
it seemed to suggest various kinds: hardships, anxieties, and the suffering born of the indifference that comes from having already suffered a lot.
a statue of pessoa sitting at a table (below) can be seen outside a brasileira, one of the preferred places of young writers and artists of orpheu's group during the 1910s.
this coffeehouse, in the aristocratic district of chiado, is quite close to pessoa's birthplace: 4, são carlos square (in front of the opera house, where stands another statue of the writer), one of the most elegant neighborhoods of lisbon.
later on, pessoa was a frequent customer at martinho da arcada, a centennial coffeehouse in comercio square, surrounded by ministries, almost an "office" for his private business and literary concerns, where he used to meet friends in the 1920s and 1930s.
in 1925, pessoa wrote in english a guidebook to lisbon but it remained unpublished until 1992.
pessoa translated a number of portuguese books into english, and into portuguese the scarlet letter by nathaniel hawthorne, and the short stories "the theory and the hound", "the roads we take" and "georgia's ruling" by o. henry.
pessoa also translated into portuguese the poetry "godiva" by alfred tennyson, "lucy" by william wordsworth, "barbara frietchie" by john greenleaf whittier, "catarina to camoens" by elizabeth barrett browning, and "the raven", "annabel lee" and "ulalume" by edgar allan poe who, along with walt whitman, strongly influenced him.
as a translator, pessoa had his own method:
a poem is an intellectualized impression, an idea made emotion, communicated by others by means of a rhythm.
this rhythm is double in one, like the concave and convex aspects of the same arc: it is made up of a verbal or musical rhythm and of a visual or image rhythm which concurs inwardly with it.
the translation of a poem should therefore conform absolutely (1) to the idea or emotion which constitutes the poem, (2) to the verbal rhythm in which that idea or emotion is expressed; it should conform relatively to the inner or visual rhythm, keeping to the images themselves when it can, but keeping always to the type of image.it was on this criterion that i based my translation into portuguese of poe’s "annabel lee" and "ulalume", which i translated, not because of their great intrinsic worth, but because they were a standing challenge to translators.
in addition, pessoa translated into portuguese some books by the leading theosophists helena blavatsky, charles webster leadbeater, annie besant, and mabel collins.
in 1912–14, while living with his aunt "anica" and cousins, pessoa took part in "semi-spiritualist sessions" that were carried out at home, but he was considered a "delaying element" by the other members of the sessions.
pessoa's interest in spiritualism was truly awakened in the second half of 1915, while translating theosophist books.
this was further deepened in the end of march 1916, when he suddenly started having experiences where he believed he became a medium, having experimented with automatic writing.
[citation needed] on 24 june, pessoa wrote an impressive letter to his aunt and godmother, then living in switzerland with her daughter and son in law, in which he describes this "mystery case" that surprised him.
[citation needed]
besides automatic writing, pessoa stated also that he had "astral" or "etherial visions" and was able to see "magnetic auras" similar to radiographic images.
he felt "more curiosity than fear", but was respectful towards this phenomenon and asked secrecy, because "there is no advantage, but many disadvantages" in speaking about this.
mediumship exerted a strong influence in pessoa's writings, who felt "sometimes suddenly being owned by something else" or having a "very curious sensation" in the right arm, which was "lifted into the air" without his will.
looking in the mirror, pessoa saw several times what appeared to be the heteronyms: his "face fading out" and being replaced by the one of "a bearded man", or another one, four men in total.
pessoa also developed a strong interest in astrology, becoming a competent astrologist.
he elaborated more than 1,500 astrological charts, including well-known people like william shakespeare, lord byron, oscar wilde, chopin, robespierre, napoleon i, benito mussolini, wilhelm ii, leopold ii of belgium, victor emmanuel iii, alfonso xiii, or the kings sebastian and charles of portugal, and salazar.
in 1915, he created the heteronym raphael baldaya, an astrologist who planned to write "system of astrology" and "introduction to the study of occultism".
pessoa established the pricing of his astrological services from 500 to 5,000 réis and made horoscopes of customers, friends and also himself and, astonishingly, of the heteronyms and also of journals as orpheu.
born on 13 june, pessoa was native of gemini and had scorpio as rising sign.
the characters of the main heteronyms were inspired by the four astral elements: air, fire, water and earth.
it means that pessoa and his heteronyms altogether comprised the full principles of ancient knowledge.
those heteronyms were designed according to their horoscopes, all including mercury, the planet of literature.
astrology was part of his everyday life and pessoa kept that interest until his death, which he was able to predict with some accuracy.
as a mysticist, pessoa was an enthusiast of esotericism, occultism, hermetism, numerology and alchemy.
along with spiritualism and astrology, he also paid attention to neopaganism, theosophy, rosicrucianism and freemasonry, which strongly influenced his literary work.
he has declared himself a pagan, in the sense of an "intellectual mystic of the sad race of the neoplatonists from alexandria" and a believer in "the gods, their agency and their real and materially superior existence".
his interest in occultism led pessoa to correspond with aleister crowley and later helped him to elaborate a fake suicide, when crowley visited portugal in 1930. pessoa translated crowley's poem "hymn to pan" into portuguese, and the catalogue of pessoa's library shows that he possessed crowley's books magick in theory and practice and confessions.
pessoa also wrote on crowley's doctrine of thelema in several fragments, including moral.
pessoa's declared about secret societies:
i am also very interested in knowing whether a second edition is shortly to be expected of athur edward waite’s the secret tradition in freemasonery.
i see that, in a note on page 14 of his emblematic freemasonery, published by you in 1925, he says, in respect of the earlier work: "a new and revised edition is in the forefront of my literary schemes."
for all i know, you may already have issued such an edition; if so, i have missed the reference in the times literary supplement.
since i am writing on these subjects, i should like to put a question which perhaps you can reply to; but please do not do so if the reply involves any inconvenience.
i believe the occult review was, or is, issued by yourselves; i have not seen any number for a long time.
my question is in what issue of that publication – it was certainly a long while ago – an article was printed relating to the roman catholic church as a secret society, or, alternatively, to a secret society within the roman catholic church.
literary critic martin lüdke described pessoa's philosophy as a kind of pandeism, especially those writings under the heteronym alberto caeiro.
in his early years, pessoa was influenced by major english classic poets such as shakespeare, milton and pope, or romantics like shelley, byron, keats, wordsworth, coleridge and tennyson.
after his return to lisbon in 1905, pessoa was influenced by french symbolists and decadentists charles baudelaire, maurice rollinat, stéphane mallarmé; mainly by portuguese poets as antero de quental, gomes leal, cesário verde, antónio nobre, camilo pessanha or teixeira de pascoaes.
later on, he was also influenced by modernists as w. b. yeats, james joyce, ezra pound and t. s. eliot, among many other writers.
during world war i, pessoa wrote to a number of british publishers, namely constable & co. ltd. (currently constable & robinson), in order to print his collection of english verse the mad fiddler (unpublished during his lifetime), but it was refused.
however, in 1920, the prestigious literary journal athenaeum included one of those poems.
since the british publication failed, in 1918 pessoa published in lisbon two slim volumes of english verse: antinous and 35 sonnets, received by the british literary press without enthusiasm.
along with some friends, he founded another publishing house – olisipo – which published in 1921 a further two english poetry volumes: english poems i–ii and english poems iii by fernando pessoa.
in his publishing house, pessoa issued also some books by his friends: a invenção do dia claro (the invention of the clear day) by josé de almada negreiros, canções (songs) by antónio botto, and sodoma divinizada (divinized sodom) by raul leal (henoch).
olisipo closed down in 1923, following the scandal known as "literatura de sodoma" (literature of sodom), which pessoa started with his paper "antónio botto e o ideal estético em portugal" (antónio botto and the aesthetical ideal in portugal), published in the journal contemporanea.
politically, pessoa described himself as "a british-style conservative, that is to say, liberal within conservatism and absolutely anti-reactionary," and adhered closely to the spencerian individualism of his upbringing.
he described his brand of nationalism as "mystic, cosmopolitan, liberal, and anti-catholic."
he was an outspoken elitist and aligned himself against communism, socialism, fascism and catholicism.
he initially rallied to the first portuguese republic but the ensuing instability caused him to reluctantly support the military coups of 1917 and 1926 as a means of restoring order and preparing the transition to a new constitutional normality.
he wrote a pamphlet in 1928 supportive of the military dictatorship but after the establishment of the new state, in 1933, pessoa became disenchanted with the regime and wrote critically of salazar and fascism in general, maintaining a hostile stance towards its corporatist program, illiberalism, and censorship.
in the beginning of 1935, pessoa was banned by the salazar regime, after he wrote in defense of freemasonry.
the regime also suppressed two articles pessoa wrote in which he condemned mussolini's invasion of abyssinia and fascism as a threat to human liberty everywhere.
on 29 november 1935, pessoa was taken to the hospital de são luís, suffering from abdominal pain and a high fever; there he wrote, in english, his last words: "i know not what tomorrow will bring."
he died the next day, 30 november 1935, around 8 pm, aged 47. his cause of death is commonly given as cirrhosis of the liver, due to alcoholism, though this is disputed: others attribute his death to pancreatitis (again from alcoholism), or other ailments.
in his lifetime, he published four books in english and one alone in portuguese: mensagem (message).
however, he left a lifetime of unpublished, unfinished or just sketchy work in a domed, wooden trunk (25,574 manuscript and typed pages which have been housed in the portuguese national library since 1988).
the heavy burden of editing this huge work is still in progress.
in 1985 (fifty years after his death), pessoa's remains were moved to the hieronymites monastery, in lisbon, where vasco da gama, luís de camões, and alexandre herculano are also buried.
pessoa's portrait was on the 100-escudo banknote.
[…] on 8 march 1914 – i found myself standing before a tall chest of drawers, took up a piece of paper, began to write, remaining upright all the while since i always stand when i can.
i wrote thirty some poems in a row, all in a kind of ecstasy, the nature of which i shall never fathom.
it was the triumphant day of my life, and i shall never have another like it.
i began with a title, the keeper of sheep.
and what followed was the appearance of someone within me to whom i promptly assigned the name of alberto caeiro.
please excuse the absurdity of what i am about to say, but there had appeared within me, then and there, my own master.
it was my immediate sensation.
so much so that, with those thirty odd poems written, i immediately took up another sheet of paper and wrote as well, in a row, the six poems that make up "oblique rain" by fernando pessoa.
immediately and totally... it was the return from fernando pessoa/alberto caeiro to fernando pessoa alone.
or better still, it was fernando pessoa’s reaction to his own inexistence as alberto caeiro.
as the fake heteronym coelho pacheco, over a long period pessoa's "triumphant day" was taken as real, however, it has been proved that this event was one more fiction created by pessoa.
pessoa's earliest heteronym, at the age of six, was chevalier de pas.
other childhood heteronyms included dr. pancrácio and david merrick, followed by charles robert anon, an english young man that became pessoa's alter ego.
in 1905/7, when pessoa was a student at the university of lisbon, alexander search took the place of anon.
the main reason for this was that, although search is english, he was born in lisbon as his author.
but search represents a transition heteronym that pessoa used while searching to adapt to the portuguese cultural reality.
after the republican revolution, in 1910, and consequent patriotic atmosphere, pessoa created another alter ego, álvaro de campos, supposedly a portuguese naval engineer, born in tavira and graduated in glasgow.
translator richard zenith notes that pessoa eventually established at least seventy-two heteronyms.
according to pessoa himself, there were three main heteronyms: alberto caeiro, álvaro de campos and ricardo reis.
the heteronyms possess distinct biographies, temperaments, philosophies, appearances, writing styles and even signatures.
pessoa wrote on the heteronyms:
how do i write in the name of these three?
caeiro, through sheer and unexpected inspiration, without knowing or even suspecting that i’m going to write in his name.
ricardo reis, after an abstract meditation, which suddenly takes concrete shape in an ode.
campos, when i feel a sudden impulse to write and don’t know what.
(my semi-heteronym bernardo soares, who in many ways resembles álvaro de campos, always appears when i'm sleepy or drowsy, so that my qualities of inhibition and rational thought are suspended; his prose is an endless reverie.
he’s a semi-heteronym because his personality, although not my own, doesn’t differ from my own but is a mere mutilation of it.
he’s me without my rationalism and emotions.
his prose is the same as mine, except for certain formal restraint that reason imposes on my own writing, and his portuguese is exactly the same – whereas caeiro writes bad portuguese, campos writes it reasonably well but with mistakes such as "me myself" instead of "i myself", etc.., and reis writes better than i, but with a purism i find excessive...).
alberto caeiro was pessoa's first great heteronym; it is summarized by pessoa as follows: "he sees things with the eyes only, not with the mind.
he does not let any thoughts arise when he looks at a flower... the only thing a stone tells him is that it has nothing at all to tell him... this way of looking at a stone may be described as the totally unpoetic way of looking at it.
the stupendous fact about caeiro is that out of this sentiment, or rather, absence of sentiment, he makes poetry."
what this means, and what makes caeiro such an original poet is the way he apprehends existence.
he does not question anything whatsoever; he calmly accepts the world as it is.
the recurrent themes to be found in nearly all of caeiro's poems are wide-eyed childlike wonder at the infinite variety of nature, as noted by a critic.
he is free of metaphysical entanglements.
central to his world-view is the idea that in the world around us, all is surface: things are precisely what they seem, there is no hidden meaning anywhere.
he manages thus to free himself from the anxieties that batter his peers; for caeiro, things simply exist and we have no right to credit them with more than that.
caeiro attains happiness by not questioning, and by thus avoiding doubts and uncertainties.
he apprehends reality solely through his eyes, through his senses.
octavio paz called him the innocent poet.
paz made a shrewd remark on the heteronyms: in each are particles of negation or unreality.
reis believes in form, campos in sensation, pessoa in symbols.
caeiro doesn't believe in anything.
he exists.
poetry before caeiro was essentially interpretative; what poets did was to offer an interpretation of their perceived surroundings; caeiro does not do this.
instead, he attempts to communicate his senses, and his feelings, without any interpretation whatsoever.
caeiro attempts to approach nature from a qualitatively different mode of apprehension; that of simply perceiving (an approach akin to phenomenological approaches to philosophy).
poets before him would make use of intricate metaphors to describe what was before them; not so caeiro: his self-appointed task is to bring these objects to the reader's attention, as directly and simply as possible.
caeiro sought a direct experience of the objects before him.
as such it is not surprising to find that caeiro has been called an anti-intellectual, anti-romantic, anti-subjectivist, anti-metaphysical...an anti-poet, by critics; caeiro simply—is.
he is in this sense very unlike his creator fernando pessoa: pessoa was besieged by metaphysical uncertainties; these were, to a large extent, the cause of his unhappiness; not so caeiro: his attitude is anti-metaphysical; he avoided uncertainties by adamantly clinging to a certainty: his belief that there is no meaning behind things.
things, for him, simply—are.
caeiro represents a primal vision of reality, of things.
he is the pagan incarnate.
indeed, caeiro was not simply a pagan but paganism itself.
the critic jane m. sheets sees the insurgence of caeiro—who was pessoa's first major heteronym—as essential in founding the later poetic personas: by means of this artless yet affirmative anti-poet, caeiro, a short-lived but vital member of his coterie, pessoa acquired the base of an experienced and universal poetic vision.
after caeiro's tenets had been established, the avowedly poetic voices of campos, reis and pessoa himself spoke with greater assurance.
in a letter to william bentley,  pessoa wrote that "a knowledge of the language would be indispensable, for instance, to appraise the 'odes' of ricardo reis, whose portuguese would draw upon him the blessing of antónio vieira, as his stile and diction that of horace (he has been called, admirably i believe, 'a greek horace who writes in portuguese')".
reis, both a character and a heteronym of fernando pessoa himself, sums up his philosophy of life in his own words, admonishing, "see life from a distance.
never question it.
there's nothing it can tell you."
like caeiro, whom he admires, reis defers from questioning life.
he is a modern pagan who urges one to seize the day and accept fate with tranquility.
"wise is the one who does not seek.
the seeker will find in all things the abyss, and doubt in himself.
"[citation needed] in this sense, reis shares essential affinities with caeiro.
believing in the greek gods, yet living in a christian europe, reis feels that his spiritual life is limited and true happiness cannot be attained.
this, added to his belief in fate as a driving force for all that exists, as such disregarding freedom, leads to his epicureanist philosophy, which entails the avoidance of pain, defending that man should seek tranquility and calm above all else, avoiding emotional extremes.
where caeiro wrote freely and spontaneously, with joviality, of his basic, meaningless connection to the world, reis writes in an austere, cerebral manner, with premeditated rhythm and structure and a particular attention to the correct use of the language when approaching his subjects of, as characterized by richard zenith, "the brevity of life, the vanity of wealth and struggle, the joy of simple pleasures, patience in time of trouble, and avoidance of extremes".
in his detached, intellectual approach, he is closer to fernando pessoa's constant rationalization, as such representing the orthonym's wish for measure and sobriety and a world free of troubles and respite, in stark contrast to caeiro's spirit and style.
as such, where caeiro's predominant attitude is that of joviality, his sadness being accepted as natural ("my sadness is a comfort for it is natural and right.
"), reis is marked by melancholy, saddened by the impermanence of all things.
ricardo reis is the main character of josé saramago's 1986 novel the year of the death of ricardo reis.
álvaro de campos manifests, in a way, as a hyperbolic version of pessoa himself.
of the three heteronyms he is the one who feels most strongly, his motto being 'to feel everything in every way.'
'the best way to travel,' he wrote, 'is to feel.'
as such, his poetry is the most emotionally intense and varied, constantly juggling two fundamental impulses: on the one hand a feverish desire to be and feel everything and everyone, declaring that 'in every corner of my soul stands an altar to a different god' (alluding to walt whitman's desire to 'contain multitudes'), on the other, a wish for a state of isolation and a sense of nothingness.
as a result, his mood and principles varied between violent, dynamic exultation, as he fervently wishes to experience the entirety of the universe in himself, in all manners possible (a particularly distinctive trait in this state being his futuristic leanings, including the expression of great enthusiasm as to the meaning of city life and its components) and a state of nostalgic melancholy, where life is viewed as, essentially, empty.
one of the poet's constant preoccupations, as part of his dichotomous character, is that of identity: he does not know who he is, or rather, fails at achieving an ideal identity.
wanting to be everything, and inevitably failing, he despairs.
unlike caeiro, who asks nothing of life, he asks too much.
in his poetic meditation 'tobacco shop' he asks:
how should i know what i'll be, i who don't know what i am?to be what i think?
but i think of being so many things!
mensagem, written in portuguese, is a symbolist epic made up of 44 short poems organized in three parts or cycles:
the first, called "brasão" (coat-of-arms), relates portuguese historical protagonists to each of the fields and charges in the portuguese coat of arms.
the first two poems ("the castles" and "the escutcheons") draw inspiration from the material and spiritual natures of portugal.
each of the remaining poems associates to each charge a historical personality.
ultimately they all lead to the golden age of discovery.
the second part, called "mar português" (portuguese sea), references the country's age of portuguese exploration and to its seaborne empire that ended with the death of king sebastian at el-ksar el kebir (alcácer-quibir in portuguese) in 1578. pessoa brings the reader to the present as if he had woken up from a dream of the past, to fall in a dream of the future: he sees king sebastian returning and still bent on accomplishing a universal empire.
the third cycle, called "o encoberto" ("the hidden one"), refers to pessoa's vision of a future world of peace and the fifth empire (which, according to pessoa, is spiritual and not material, because if it were material england would already have achieved it).
after the age of force, (vis), and taedium (otium) will come science (understanding) through a reawakening of "the hidden one", or "king sebastian".
the hidden one represents the fulfillment of the destiny of mankind, designed by god since before time, and the accomplishment of portugal.
king sebastian is very important, indeed he appears in all three parts of mensagem.
he represents the capacity of dreaming, and believing that it's possible to achieve dreams.
one of the most famous quotes from mensagem is the first line from o infante (belonging to the second part), which is deus quer, o homem sonha, a obra nasce (which translates roughly to "god wishes, man dreams, the work is born").
another well-known quote from mensagem is the first line from ulysses, "o mito é o nada que é tudo" (a possible translation is "the myth is the nothing that is all").
this poem refers to  ulysses, king of ithaca, as lisbon's founder (recalling an ancient greek myth).
in 1912, fernando pessoa wrote a set of essays (later collected as the new portuguese poetry) for the cultural journal a águia (the eagle), founded in oporto, in december 1910, and run by the republican association renascença portuguesa.
in the first years of the portuguese republic, this cultural association was started by republican intellectuals led by the writer and poet teixeira de pascoaes, philosopher leonardo coimbra and historian jaime cortesão, aiming for the renewal of portuguese culture through the aesthetic movement called saudosismo.
pessoa contributed to the journal a águia with a series of papers: 'the new portuguese poetry sociologically considered' (nr.
4), 'relapsing...' (nr.
5) and 'the psychological aspect of the new portuguese poetry' (nrs.
9,11 and 12).
these writings were strongly encomiastic to saudosist literature, namely the poetry of teixeira de pascoaes and mário beirão.
the articles disclose pessoa as a connoisseur of modern european literature and an expert of recent literary trends.
on the other hand, he does not care much for a methodology of analysis or problems in the history of ideas.
he states his confidence that portugal would soon produce a great poet – a super-camões – pledged to make an important contribution for european culture, and indeed, for humanity.
the philosophical notes of the young pessoa, mostly written between 1905 and 1912, illustrate his debt to the history of philosophy more through commentators than through a first-hand protracted reading of the classics, ancient or modern.
[citation needed] the issues he engages with pertain to every philosophical discipline and concern a large profusion of concepts, creating a vast semantic spectrum in texts whose length varies between half a dozen lines and half a dozen pages and whose density of analysis is extremely variable; simple paraphrasis, expression of assumptions and original speculation.
pessoa sorted the philosophical systems thus:
such pantheist transcendentalism is used by pessoa to define the project that "encompasses and exceeds all systems"; to characterize the new poetry of saudosismo where the "typical contradiction of this system" occurs; to inquire of the particular social and political results of its adoption as the leading cultural paradigm; and, at last, he hints that metaphysics and religiosity strive "to find in everything a beyond".
gibran khalil gibran (arabic: جبران خليل جبران‎, ala-lc: jubrān khalīl jubrān, pronounced [ʒʊˈbraːn xaˈliːl ʒʊˈbraːn], or jibrān khalīl jibrān, pronounced [ʒɪˈbraːn xaˈliːl ʒɪˈbraːn];[a] january 6, 1883 – april 10, 1931), usually referred to in english as kahlil gibran[b] (pronounced /kɑːˈliːl dʒɪˈbrɑːn/ kah-leel ji-brahn), was a lebanese-american writer, poet and visual artist, also considered a philosopher although he himself rejected the title.
he is best known as the author of the prophet, which was first published in the united states in 1923 and has since become one of the best-selling books of all time, having been translated in more than 100 languages.
[c] born in a village of the ottoman-ruled mount lebanon mutasarrifate to a maronite family, the young gibran immigrated with his mother and siblings to the united states in 1895. as his mother worked as a seamstress, he was enrolled at a school in boston, where his creative abilities were quickly noticed by a teacher who presented him to fred holland day.
gibran was sent back to his native land by his family at the age of fifteen to enroll at the collège de la sagesse in beirut.
returning to boston upon his youngest sister's death in 1902, he lost his older half-brother and his mother the following year, seemingly relying afterwards on his remaining sister's income from her work at a dressmaker's shop for some time.
in 1904, gibran's drawings were displayed for the first time at day's studio in boston, and his first book in arabic was published in 1905 in new york city.
with the financial help of a newly-met benefactress, mary haskell, gibran studied art in paris from 1908 to 1910. while there, he came in contact with syrian political thinkers promoting rebellion in the ottoman empire after the young turk revolution; some of gibran's writings, voicing the same ideas as well as anti-clericalism, would eventually be banned by the ottoman authorities.
in 1911, gibran settled in new york, where his first book in english, the madman, would be published by alfred a. knopf in 1918 with writing of the prophet or the earth gods also underway.
his visual artwork was shown at montross gallery in 1914, and at the galleries of m. knoedler & co. in 1917. he had also been corresponding remarkably with may ziadeh since 1912. in 1920, gibran re-founded the pen league with fellow mahjari poets.
by the time of his death at the age of 48 from cirrhosis and incipient tuberculosis in one lung, he had achieved literary fame on "both sides of the atlantic ocean," and the prophet had already been translated into german and in french.
his body was transferred to his birth village of bsharri (in present-day lebanon), to which he had bequeathed all future royalties on his books, and where a museum dedicated to his works now stands.
as worded by suheil bushrui and joe jenkins, gibran's life has been described as one "often caught between nietzschean rebellion, blakean pantheism and sufi mysticism."
gibran discussed different themes in his writings, and explored diverse literary forms.
salma khadra jayyusi has called him "the single most important influence on arabic poetry and literature during the first half of [the twentieth] century," and he is still celebrated as a literary hero in lebanon.
at the same time, "most of gibran's paintings expressed his personal vision, incorporating spiritual and mythological symbolism," with art critic alice raphael recognizing in the painter a classicist, whose work owed "more to the findings of da vinci than it [did] to any modern insurgent."
his "prodigious body of work" has been described as "an artistic legacy to people of all nations."
gibran was born january 6, 1883, in the village of bsharri in the mount lebanon mutasarrifate, ottoman empire (modern-day lebanon).
his parents, khalil sa'd gibran and kamila rahmeh, the daughter of a priest, were maronite christians.
kamila was thirty when gibran was born, and gibran's father, khalil, was her third husband.
gibran had two younger sisters, marianna and sultana, and a half-brother, boutros, from one of kamila's previous marriages.
as a result of his family's poverty, gibran received no formal schooling for his first twelve years in lebanon: in 1888, gibran entered bsharri's one-class school which was run by a priest, and where he learnt the rudiments of arabic, syriac, and arithmetic.
gibran's father khalil initially worked in an apothecary, but with gambling debts he was unable to pay.
he went to work for a local ottoman-appointed administrator.
in 1891, while acting as a tax collector, he was removed and his staff was investigated.
khalil was imprisoned for embezzlement, and his family's property was confiscated by the authorities.
kamila decided to follow her brother to the united states.
although khalil was released in 1894, kamila remained resolved and left for new york on june 25, 1895, taking boutros, gibran, marianna and sultana with her.
kamila and her children settled in boston's south end, at the time the second-largest syrian-lebanese-american community in the united states.
gibran entered the josiah quincy school on september 30, 1895. school officials placed him in a special class for immigrants to learn english.
his name was registered using the anglicized spelling 'kahlil gibran'.
his mother began working as a seamstress peddler, selling lace and linens that she carried from door to door.
his elder half-brother boutros opened a shop.
gibran also enrolled in an art school at denison house, a nearby settlement house.
through his teachers there, he was introduced to the avant-garde boston artist, photographer, and publisher fred holland day, who encouraged and supported gibran in his creative endeavors.
in march 1898, gibran met josephine preston peabody, eight years older than him, at an exhibition of day's photographs "in which gibran's face was a major subject."
gibran would develop a romantic attachment to her.
the same year, a publisher used some of gibran's drawings for book covers.
kamila and boutros wanted gibran to absorb more of his own heritage rather than just the western aesthetic culture he was attracted to.
thus, at the age of 15, gibran returned to his homeland to study three years at the collège de la sagesse, a maronite-run institute in beirut.
in his final year at the school, he created a student magazine with other students, among whom youssef howayek (who would remain a lifelong friend of his), and he was made the "college poet."
gibran graduated from the school at eighteen with high honors, then went to paris to learn painting, visiting greece, italy, and spain on his way there from beirut.
on april 2, 1902, sultana died, aged 14, from what seems to have been tuberculosis.
upon learning about it, gibran returned to boston, arriving two weeks after sultana's death.
[e] the year after, on march 12, boutros died of the same disease and his mother died of cancer on june 28. two days later, peabody "left him without explanation."
marianna supported gibran and herself by working at a dressmaker's shop.
gibran held his first art exhibition of his drawings in january 1904 in boston at day's studio.
during this exhibition, gibran met mary haskell, the headmistress of a girls' school in the city, nine years his senior.
the two formed a friendship which lasted the rest of gibran's life.
haskell would spend large sums of money to support gibran and would also edit all of his english writings.
the nature of their romantic relationship remains obscure; while some biographers assert the two were lovers but never married because haskell's family objected; other evidence suggests that their relationship never was physically consummated.
gibran and haskell were engaged briefly between 1910 and 1911. according to joseph p. ghougassian, gibran had proposed to her "not knowing how to repay back in gratitude to miss haskell," but haskell called it off, making "clear to him that she preferred his friendship to any burdensome tie of marriage."
haskell would later marry jacob florance minis in 1926, while remaining yet gibran's close friend, patroness and benefactress, and using as such her influence to advance his career.
in 1905, gibran's first writing to be published was a profile of the art of music, in arabic, by al-mohajer's printing department in new york.
his next work, nymphs of the valley, was published the following year, also in arabic.
on january 27, 1908, haskell introduced gibran to her friend writer charlotte teller, aged 31, and in february, to émilie michel (micheline), a french teacher at her school, aged 19. both teller and micheline accepted to pose for gibran as models and became close friends of his.
the same year, gibran published spirits rebellious, a novel deeply critical of secular and spiritual authority.
according to barbara young, a late acquaintance of gibran, "in an incredibly short time it was burned in the market place in beirut by priestly zealots who pronounced it 'dangerous, revolutionary, and poisonous to youth.'"
the maronite patriarchate would let the rumor of his excommunication wander, but would never officially pronounce it.
in july 1908, with haskell's financial support, gibran went to study art in paris at the académie julian where he joined the atelier of jean-paul laurens.
gibran had accepted haskell's offer partly so as to distance himself from micheline, "for he knew that this love was contrary to his sense of gratefulness toward miss haskell"; however, "to his surprise micheline came unexpectedly to him in paris."
"she became pregnant, but the pregnancy was ectopic, and she had to have an abortion, probably in france."
micheline had returned to the united states by late october.
gibran would pay her a visit upon her return to paris in july 1910, but there would be no hint of intimacy left between them.
by early february 1909, gibran had "been working for a few weeks in the studio of pierre marcel-béronneau"; he "used his sympathy towards béronneau as an excuse to leave the académie julian altogether."
in december 1909,[f] gibran started a series of pencil portraits which he would later call "the temple of art," featuring "famous men and women artists of the day," and "a few of gibran's heroes from past times.
"[g] while in paris, gibran also entered in contact with syrian political dissidents, in whose activities he would attempt to be more involved upon his return to the united states.
in june 1910, gibran visited london with howayek and ameen rihani, whom gibran had met in paris.
rihani, who was six years older than gibran, would be gibran's role model for a while, and a friend until at least may 1912.
[h] gibran biographer robin waterfield argues that, by 1918, "as gibran's role changed from that of angry young man to that of prophet, rihani could no longer act as a paradigm"; haskell (in her private journal entry of may 29, 1924) and howayek also provided hints at an enmity settled between gibran and rihani sometime after may 1912.
gibran sailed back to new york city from boulogne-sur-mer on the nieuw amsterdam october 22, 1910, and was back to boston by november 11. by february 1911, gibran had joined the boston branch of a syrian international organization, the golden links society.
[i] he lectured there for several months "in order to promote radicalism in independence and liberty" from the ottoman empire.
at the end of april, gibran was staying in teller's vacant flat at 164 waverly place in new york city.
"gibran settled in, made himself known to his syrian friends—especially amin rihani, who was now living in new york—and began both to look for a suitable studio and to sample the energy of new york."
as teller returned on may 15, he moved to rihani's small room at 28 west 9th street.
[j] gibran then moved to one of the tenth street studio building's studios for the summer, before changing to another of its studios (number 30, which had a balcony, on the third story) in fall.
gibran would live there until his death, referring to it as "the hermitage."
over time, however, and "ostensibly often for reasons of health," he would spend "longer and longer periods away from new york, sometimes months at a time [...], staying either with friends in the coutryside or with marianna in boston or on the massachusetts coast."
his friendships with teller and micheline would wane; the last encounter between gibran and teller would occur in september 1912, and gibran would tell haskell in 1914 that he now found micheline "repellent.

in 1912, broken wings was published in arabic by the printing house of the periodical meraat-ul-gharb in new york.
gibran presented lebanese writer may ziadeh, who lived in egypt, with a copy of his book and asked her to criticize it.
as worded by ghougassian,
her reply on may 12, 1912, did not totally approve of gibran's philosophy of love.
rather she remained in all her correspondence quite critical of a few of gibran's westernized ideas.
still he had a strong emotional attachment to miss ziadeh till his death.
gibran and ziadeh never met.
according to shlomit c. schuster, "whatever the relationship between kahlil and may might have been, the letters in a self-portrait [ferris, anthony r., ed.
(1959), translated by ferris] mainly reveal their literary ties.
ziadeh reviewed all of gibran's books and gibran replies to these reviews elegantly."
to albert pinkham ryder (1915), first two verses
in 1913, gibran started contributing to al-funoon, an arabic-language magazine which had been recently established by nasib arida and abd al-masih haddad.
a tear and a smile was published in arabic in 1914. in december of the same year, visual artworks by gibran were shown at the montross gallery, catching the attention of albert pinkham ryder.
gibran wrote him a prose poem in january and would become one of the aged man's last visitors.
after ryder's death in 1917, gibran's poem would be quoted by henry mcbride in the latter's posthumous tribute to ryder then by newspapers across the country, from which would come the first widespread mention of gibran's name in america.
by march 1915, two of gibran's poems had also been read at the poetry society of america, after which corinne roosevelt robinson, the younger sister of theodore roosevelt, stood up and called them "destructive and diabolical stuff"; gibran would nevertheless become a frequent visitor at robinson's starting in 1918, also meeting her brother.
gibran acted as a secretary of the syrian–mount lebanon relief committee which was formed in june 1916. the same year, gibran met mikhail naimy after the latter had moved from the university of washington to new york.
naimy, whom gibran would nickname "mischa," had previously made a review of broken wings in his article "the dawn of hope after the night of despair" published in al-funoon, and would become "a close friend and confidant, and later one of gibran's biographers."
in 1917, an exhibition of forty wash drawings was held at knoedler in new york from january 29 to february 19 and another of thirty such drawings at doll & richards, boston, april 16–28.
while most of gibran's early writings had been in arabic, most of his work published after 1918 was in english.
such was the madman, gibran's first book published by alfred a. knopf, in 1918. the processions (in arabic) and twenty drawings were published the following year.
in 1920, gibran re-created the arabic-language new york pen league with its original founders arida and haddad; rihani, naimy, and other mahjari writers such as elia abu madi.
the same year, the tempests was published in arabic in cairo, and the forerunner in new york.
in a letter of 1921 to naimy, gibran reported that doctors had told him to "give up all kinds of work and exertion for six months, and do nothing but eat, drink and rest"; in 1922, gibran was ordered to "stay away from cities and city life" and had rented a cottage near the sea, planning to move there with marianna and to remain until "this heart [regained] its orderly course"; this three-month summer in scituate, he later told haskell, was a refreshing time, during which he wrote some of "the best arabic poems" he had ever written.
in 1923, the new and the marvelous was published in arabic in cairo, whereas the prophet was published in new york.
the prophet sold well despite a cool critical reception.
[l] at a reading of the prophet organized by rector william norman guthrie in st. mark's church in-the-bowery, gibran met young, who would occasionally work as his secretary from 1925 until his death (no remuneration was paid).
in 1924, gibran told haskell that he had been contracted to write ten pieces for al-hilal in cairo.
in 1925, gibran participated in the founding of the periodical the new east.
sand and foam was published in 1926, and jesus, the son of man in 1928. at the beginning of 1929, gibran was diagnosed with an enlarged liver.
in a letter dated march 26, he wrote to naimy that "the rheumatic pains are gone, and the swelling has turned to something opposite"; in a telegram dated the same day, he reported being told by the doctors that he "must not work for full year," which was something he found "more painful than illness."
the last book published in gibran's lifetime was the earth gods, on march 14, 1931.
gibran was admitted to st. vincent's hospital, manhattan, on april 10, 1931, where he died the same day, aged 48, after having refused the last rites.
the cause of death was reported to be cirrhosis of the liver with incipient tuberculosis in one of his lungs.
waterfield argues that the cirrhosis was contracted through excessive drinking of alcohol and was the only real cause of gibran's death.
epitaph at the gibran museum
gibran had expressed the wish that he be buried in lebanon.
his body lay temporarily at mount benedict cemetery in boston, before it was taken on july 23 to providence, rhode island, and from there to lebanon on the liner sinaia.
it reached bsharri in august and was deposited in a church nearby until a cousin of gibran finalized the purchase of the mar sarkis monastery, now the gibran museum.
all future american royalties to his books were willed to his hometown of bsharri, to be "used for good causes."
gibran had also willed the contents of his studio to haskell.
going through his papers, young and haskell discovered that gibran had kept all of mary's love letters to him.
young admitted to being stunned at the depth of the relationship, which was all but unknown to her.
in her own biography of gibran, she minimized the relationship and begged mary haskell to burn the letters.
mary agreed initially but then reneged, and eventually they were published, along with her journal and gibran's some three hundred letters to her, in [virginia] hilu's beloved prophet.
haskell donated her personal collection of nearly one hundred original works of art by gibran (including five oils) to the telfair museum of art in savannah, georgia, in 1950. haskell had been thinking of placing her collection at the telfair as early as 1914.
[m] her gift to the telfair is the largest public collection of gibran's visual art in the country.
gibran explored literary forms as diverse as "poetry, parables, fragments of conversation, short stories, fables, political essays, letters, and aphorisms."
two plays in english and five plays in arabic were also published posthumously between 1973 and 1993; three unfinished plays written in english towards the end of gibran's life remain unpublished (the banshee, the last unction, and the hunchback or the man unseen).
gibran discussed "such themes as religion, justice, free will, science, love, happiness, the soul, the body, and death" in his writings, which were "characterized by innovation breaking with forms of the past, by symbolism, an undying love for his native land, and a sentimental, melancholic yet often oratorical style."
about his language in general (both in arabic and english), salma khadra jayyusi remarks that "because of the spiritual and universal aspect of his general themes, he seems to have chosen a vocabulary less idiomatic than would normally have been chosen by a modern poet conscious of modernism in language.
"according to jean and kahlil gibran,
ignoring much of the traditional vocabulary and form of classical arabic, he began to develop a style which reflected the ordinary language he had heard as a child in besharri and to which he was still exposed in the south end [of boston].
this use of the colloquial was more a product of his isolation than of a specific intent, but it appealed to thousands of arab immigrants.
the poem "you have your language and i have mine" (1924) was published in response to criticism of his arabic language and style.
as worded by ghougassian, "among the anglo-saxon authors, [william] blake (1757–1827) played a special role in gibran's life."
"most particularly, gibran agreed with blake's apocalyptic vision of the world as the latter expressed it in his poetry and art."
gibran wrote of blake as "the god-man," and of "his drawings" as "so far the profoundest things done in english—and his vision, putting aside his drawings and poems, is the most godly."
according to george nicolas el-hage,
there is evidence that gibran knew some of blake's poetry and was familiar with his drawings during his early years in boston.
however, this knowledge of blake was neither deep nor complete.
kahlil gibran was reintroduced to william blake's poetry and art in paris, most likely in auguste rodin's studio and by rodin himself [on one of their two encounters in paris after gibran had begun his temple of art portrait series[g]].
another influence on gibran was walt whitman (1819–1892), whom gibran followed "by pointing up the universality of all men and by delighting in nature.
"[n]
gibran was also a great admirer of syrian poet and writer francis marrash (born between 1835 and 1837; died 1873 or 1874), whose works he had studied at the collège de la sagesse.
according to shmuel moreh, gibran's own works echo marrash's style, "many of [his] ideas on enslavement, education, women's liberation, truth, the natural goodness of man, and the corrupted morals of society," and at times even the structure of some of his works; suheil bushrui and joe jenkins have mentioned marrash's concept of universal love, in particular, in having left a "profound impression" on gibran.
according to el-hage, the influence of friedrich nietzsche (1844–1900) "did not appear in gibran's writings until the tempests."
nevertheless, although nietzsche's style "no doubt fascinated" him, gibran was "not the least under his spell":
the teachings of almustafa are decisively different from zarathustra's philosophy and they betray a striking imitation of jesus, the way gibran pictured him.
gibran was also influenced by the bible, with, in the words of waterfield, "the parables of the new testament" affecting "his parables and homilies" and "the poetry of some of the old testament books [...] affecting his devotional language and incantational rhythms."
gibran was for a long time neglected by scholars and critics.
bushrui and john m. munro have argued that "the failure of serious western critics to respond to gibran" resulted from the fact that "his works, though for the most part originally written in english, cannot be comfortably accommodated within the western literary tradition."
according to el-hage, critics have also "generally failed to understand the poet's conception of imagination and his fluctuating tendencies towards nature."

according to waterfield, "gibran was confirmed in his aspiration to be a symbolist painter" after working in marcel-béronneau's studio in paris.
oil paint was gibran's "preferred medium between 1908 and 1914, but before and after this time he worked primarily with pencil, ink, watercolor and gouache."
in a letter to haskell, gibran wrote that "among all the english artists turner is the very greatest."
haskell recorded gibran in her diary entry of march 17, 1911, to have told her that he was inspired by turner's painting the slave ship to utilize "raw colors [...] one over another on the canvas [...] instead of killing them first on the palette" in what would be rose sleeves (1911, telfair museums).
gibran has made more than seven hundred visual artworks, including the temple of art portrait series.
his works may be seen at the gibran museum in bsharri; the telfair museums in savannah, georgia; the museo soumaya in mexico city; mathaf: arab museum of modern art in doha; the brooklyn museum and the metropolitan museum of art in new york city; and the harvard art museums.
a possible gibran painting was the subject of a september 2008 episode of the pbs tv series history detectives.
although born and raised into a maronite christian family and having attended a maronite school, gibran was also influenced by islam, and especially by the mysticism of the sufis.
his knowledge of lebanon's bloody history, with its destructive factional struggles, strengthened his belief in the fundamental unity of religions, which his parents exemplified by welcoming people of various religions in their home.
gibran's mysticism was a convergence of several different influences.
gibran's meeting c. 1911–1912 with ʻabdu'l-bahá, the leader of the bahá'í faith who was at the time on a visit to the united states, to draw his portrait, made a strong impression on him.
one of gibran's acquaintances later in life, juliet thompson, herself a bahá'í, reported that gibran was unable to sleep the night before meeting him.
in the poem "the voice of the poet" (صوت الشاعر) published in a tear and a smile (1914),[o] he wrote :
انت اخي وانا احبك ۔احبك ساجداً في جامعك وراكعاً في هيكلك ومصلياً في كنيستك ، فأنت وانا ابنا دين واحد هو الروح ، وزعماء فروع هذا الدين اصابع ملتصقة في يد الالوهية المشيرة الى كمال النفس ۔
you are my brother and i love you.i love you when you prostrate yourself in your mosque, and kneel in your church and pray in your synagogue.
you and i are sons of one faith—the spirit.
and those that are set up as heads over its many branches are as fingers on the hand of a divinity that points to the spirit's perfection.
in 1921, gibran participated in an "interrogatory" meeting on the question "do we need a new world religion to unite the old religions?"
at st. mark's church in-the-bowery.
gibran later said that he had thought of ʻabdu'l-bahá all the way through writing jesus, the son of man, which depicts jesus through the "words of 77 contemporaries who knew him – enemies and friends: syrians, romans, jews, priests, and poets."
after the death of ʻabdu'l-bahá, gibran gave a talk on religion with bahá'ís and at another event with a viewing of a movie of ʻabdu'l-bahá, gibran rose to talk and proclaimed in tears an exalted station of ʻabdu'l-bahá and left the event weeping.. also, the syriac orthodox archbishop of the americas, ignatius aphrem i barsoum once met with the pen league and later only with gibran.
[full citation needed] the author of the prophet told that people only deserve to read the poems of st. ephrem and asked him to translate them ( according to the syriac orthodox in north america (1895-1995): a short history by george kiraz.).
[full citation needed]
according to young,
during the last years of gibran's life there was much pressure put upon him from time to time to return to lebanon.
his countrymen there felt that he would be a great leader for his people if he could be persuaded to accept such a role.
he was deeply moved by their desire to have him in their midst, but he knew that to go to lebanon would be a grave mistake.
"i believe i could be a help to my people," he said.
"i could even lead them—but they would not be lead.
in their anxiety and confusion of mind they look about for some solution to their difficulties.
if i went to lebanon and took the little black book [the prophet], and said, 'come let us live in this light,' their enthusiasm for me would immediately evaporate.
i am not a politician, and i would not be a politician.
no.
i cannot fulfill their desire."
nevertheless, gibran called for the adoption of arabic as a national language of syria, considered from a geographic point of view, not as a political entity.
when gibran met ʻabdu'l-bahá in 1911–12, who traveled to the united states partly to promote peace, gibran admired the teachings on peace but argued that "young nations like his own" be freed from ottoman control.
gibran also wrote the famous "pity the nation" poem during these years, posthumously published in the garden of the prophet.
when the ottomans were eventually driven from syria during world war i, gibran sketched a euphoric drawing "free syria" which was then printed on the special edition cover of the arabic-language paper as-sayeh (the traveler; founded 1912 in new york by haddad).
adel beshara reports that, "in a draft of a play, still kept among his papers, gibran expressed great hope for national independence and progress.
this play, according to khalil hawi, 'defines gibran's belief in syrian nationalism with great clarity, distinguishing it from both lebanese and arab nationalism, and showing us that nationalism lived in his mind, even at this late stage, side by side with internationalism.'"

the popularity of the prophet grew markedly during the 1960s with the american counterculture and then with the flowering of the new age movements.
it has remained popular with these and with the wider population to this day.
since it was first published in 1923, the prophet has never been out of print.
it has been translated into more than 100 languages, making it among the top ten most translated books in history.
it was one of the best-selling books of the twentieth century in the united states.
elvis presley referred to gibran's the prophet for the rest of his life after receiving his first copy as a gift from his girlfriend june juanico in july 1956. his marked-up copy still exists in an elvis presley museum in düsseldorf.
a line of poetry from sand and foam (1926), which reads "half of what i say is meaningless, but i say it so that the other half may reach you," was used by john lennon and placed, though in a slightly altered form, into the song "julia" from the beatles' 1968 album the beatles (a.k.a.
"the white album").
johnny cash recorded the eye of the prophet as an audio cassette book, and cash can be heard talking about gibran's work on a track called "book review" on his album unearthed.
british singer david bowie mentioned gibran in the song "the width of a circle" from bowie's 1970 album the man who sold the world.
bowie used gibran as a "hip reference," because gibran's work a tear and a smile became popular in the hippie counterculture of the 1960s.
in 2016 gibran's fable "on death" from the prophet was composed in hebrew by gilad hochman to the unique setting of soprano, theorbo and percussion and premiered in france under the title river of silence.

lasar segall (july 21, 1891 – august 2, 1957) was a lithuanian jewish and brazilian painter, engraver and sculptor.
segall's work is derived from impressionism, expressionism and modernism.
his most significant themes were depictions of human suffering, war, persecution and prostitution.
segall was born in vilnius, lithuania, the son of a torah scribe.
segall moved to berlin at the age of 15 and studied first at berlin königliche akademie der künste from 1906 to 1910. at the end of 1910 he moved to dresden to continue his studies at the kunstakademie dresden as a "meisterschüler".
segall published a book of five etchings in dresden, sovenirs of vilna in 1919, and two books illustrated with lithographs titled bubu and die sanfte.
he then began to express himself more freely and developed his own style, which incorporated aspects of cubism, while exploring his own jewish background.
his earlier paintings throughout 1910 to the early 1920s depicted troubled figures surrounded in claustrophobic surroundings with exaggerated and bold features, influenced by african tribal figures.
in 1912 his first painted series of works were conducted in an elderly insane asylum.
segall's work largely portrayed the masses of persecuted humanity in his expressionist form.
later that year, he moved to são paulo, brazil, where three of his siblings were already living.
he returned to dresden in 1914 and was still quite active in the expressionist style.
in 1919 segall founded the 'dresdner sezession gruppe 1919' with otto dix, conrad felixmüller, otto lange and other artists.
segall's exhibition at the galery gurlitt received multiple awards.
however successful segall was in europe, he had already been greatly influenced by his time spent in brazil, which had already transformed both his style and his subject matter.
the visit to brazil gave segall the opportunity to obtain a strong idea of south american art and, in turn, made segall return to brazil yet again.
though segall was still a russian[citation needed] citizen, he moved back to brazil in 1923.  upon segall's return to são paulo he obtained brazilian citizenship along with his first wife, margarete.
while in brazil, his paintings were influenced heavily by the red light district in rio de janeiro.
many brazilian artists influenced segall's subject matter and strengthened his cubist form.
he became acclimated within his newfound country and painted themes contributing to brazil's countryside, mulattoes, favelas, prostitutes and plantations.
due to the harsh and extreme nature of segall's portrayal of prostitutes and his depiction of human suffering, his artwork became controversial.
this particular controversy in his artwork caused he and other well known artists to organize a pro modernist event known as the semana de arte moderna[dubious  – discuss].
in the year 1922, the semana de arte moderna was organized segall included, being one of the mainstream forerunners in the art exhibition.
the week-long event included segall's work, as well as anita malfatti's largely controversial artwork.
not only were paintings included, but performances and other art forms were conducted at the event.
segall's avant garde innovations ranked him highly among other brazilian outstanding modern artists during that time, like candido portinari and emiliano di cavalcanti.
though segall had great intentions of residing only in brazil, he continued to return and forth to europe for his own personal exhibitions.
in 1925, segall became extremely close to his pupil jenny klabin and eventually married her.
in 1932, shortly after segall's multiple visits to paris and germany he founded an organization along with other artists known as sociedade pro-arte moderna (spam).
the organization was short lived (november 1932 - december 1934).
similar to the semana de arte moderna, the organization included members of são paulo's earliest modernist forerunners.
spam's central idea was to serve as a link between artists, intellectuals, collectors, patrons, and the public as a whole.
spam was also created to serve as a public environment for vanguard art in brazil.
spam consisted of two exhibitions.
the first exhibition showed works from the artists of the school of paris from multiple são paulo collections which acknowledged brazilian artists of the time.
the controversial modernist artist, tarsila do amaral, also held her artworks in the exhibition as well as works of local artists such as anita malfatti, victor brecheret, john graz, regina graz and rossi osir.
the second half of the exhibition consisted of solely brazilian artists from são paulo and rio de janeiro- such as di cavalcanti, ismael nery, portinari and alberto da veiga guignard.
also similar to the semana de arte moderna, two significant "balls" were held by the leaders of the organization.
the rooms in which the balls were held were named "cidade de spam" (city of spam).
though these balls seemed to be fund raising events, they were merely performances to make audiences think about the ever-changing movement in brazil.
they consisted of live musical acts, dancers, built scenery and artwork and ornate costumes.
the sets were meant to portray "mini towns", and spam even had its own newspapers, anthem and multiple governing bodies.
segall's works included in the spam exhibition were two of his most important series of paintings in 1935; campos do jordao landscapes and the portraits of lucy.
lucy was an understudy pupil and segall conducted a series of images dedicated to her.
campos do jordao landscapes and the portraits of lucy depicted the world's outbreak of war, it portrayed genocides and indefinite tragedy.
the organization of spam fought for justice yet, disagreements arose between integralists, known as brazilian fascists, that discriminated against foreigners in brazil, especially jews.
with this large amount of controversy and intolerable strain on spam's membership, the group soon fell apart.
a defeated segall meant that the driving force behind the organization, had discouragingly, come to an end.
segall's work was still gaining much positive credit still in brazil, despite the dissolution of spam.
the positive feedback considers segall one of brazil's most influential modernist artists.
although, back in europe, his work was considered degenerate and preposterous.
specifically in germany, his artwork was no longer able to be shown in exhibits.
fascism was rising quickly in germany and many believed segall's work to portray negatively on europe's economic status due to the largely acknowledged outbreak of war.
this particular negative impact on his artwork then forced segall to create a series of images of his troubled jewish childhood and to depict the large number of emigration waves that he grew up with, as well.
these images also portrayed universal suffering of human existence.
still haunted by rio de janeiro's mangue, segall created images that stayed throughout his late career.
much of his earlier impact of human suffering led segall to create one of his most famous artworks in 1939 and 1940, known as navio de emigrantes (ship of emigrants).
the image depicts a heavily condensed and large number of people on the dock of a ship.
although this does not coincide with much of segall's previous work of human suffering, this provides the audience with a deep depiction of (at the time) the contemporary and controversial waves of emigrants and human affliction and persecution.
later in the mid-1940s, segall published his series of mangue drawings that revealed poverty, specifically in the rio de janeiro slums.
becoming wholeheartedly closer to his brazilian nationality, segall portrays these images in a stark manner, yet the underprivileged and oppressed images provides a significant cultural identity for the rio de janeiro inhabitants.
in 1949 till his death in 1957, he continued to work on engraving and painting mangue as well as producing a series entitled wandering women and forests.
segall's subject matter was portrayed more subtly and softer in his early career.
he did not depict much of the african influence on his artwork until he moved to brazil.
it was not until segall visited brazil for the first few times, that he branched out towards the expressionist style.
he was able to express himself in a freer manner while he portrayed the lifelong theme of his jewish culture depicting the tribulations of european jews.
although he was a humanist, he never forgot his jewish roots.
segall's initial paintings in brazil reflect a strong national connection and passion for his newfound homeland.
he portrayed the landscapes in são paulo and rio de janeiro and portrayed the different races without tension or malintention.
however, segall remained faithful towards his cubist nature throughout the majority of his artworks.
specifically, one of his famous artworks, entitled banana plantation, shows a brazilian banana plantation, thick in density.
segall achieved balance in this painting by centering the worker's neck and head protruding from the bottom of the painting.
this causes the audience to be fully focused towards the center space.
this significant symmetrical balance emphasizes the human element involved in the brazilian agricultural system.
the diminished amount of slavery in brazil during this time period, the 1920s, abolished brazilian-negro slaves and replaced them with an overwhelming number of european workers coming to brazil.
this particular image portrays the engulfment of the plantations by the europeans.
other prominent theme in segall's work is human suffering and emigration.
in another famous artwork of segall's, entitled ship of emigrants, a ship dock is overcrowded and engulfed with emigrant passengers.
not only does the image portray a dark and saddening emotion, but it significantly portrays the troubled figures aboard the ship.
the solemn faces and lack of expression on the passengers blatantly shows the harsh reality of emigrants and their depressing lifestyles of forced moves.
lasar segall's home in são paulo is now a museum, furnished with his furniture, books and plants, as well  his most famous works.
it is also a non-profit organization respected highly among the community of são paulo.
museu lasar segall is also a center for the art community in são paulo to participate in monitored cultural activities regularly.
art classes such as photography, engraving and the study of film are held in segall's home.
also incorporated in the museum is a large, highly acclaimed art library that holds specific books directed towards photography and the arts of spectacle.
the museu lasar segall is preserved to explore the stimulating experiences within multiple forms of art while still keeping a brazilian cultural identity.
the form of art conducted in brazil is of one entirely different than other art forms.
the museum is intact today because of brazil's concern to maintain their strong nationality and to preserve lasar segall's culturally influenced art dedicated for brazil.

m or m is the thirteenth letter of the modern english alphabet and the iso basic latin alphabet.
its name in english is em (pronounced /ˈɛm/), plural ems.
the letter m is derived from the phoenician mem, via the greek mu (μ, μ).
semitic mem is most likely derived from a "proto-sinaitic"  (bronze age) adoption of the  "water" ideogram in egyptian writing.
the egyptian sign had the acrophonic value /n/, from the egyptian word for "water", nt; the adoption as the semitic letter for /m/ was presumably also on acrophonic grounds, from the semitic word for "water", *mā(y)-.
the letter ⟨m⟩ represents the bilabial nasal consonant sound [m] in the orthography of latin as well as in that of many modern languages, and also in the international phonetic alphabet.
in english, the oxford english dictionary (first edition) says that ⟨m⟩ is sometimes a vowel in words like spasm and in the suffix -ism.
in modern terminology, this is described as a syllabic consonant (ipa [m̩]).
in washo, lower-case ⟨m⟩ represents a typical em sound, while upper-case ⟨m⟩ represents a voiceless em sound.
mohandas karamchand gandhi (/ˈɡɑːndi, ˈɡændi/; 2 october 1869 – 30 january 1948) was an indian lawyer,anti-colonial nationalist, and political ethicist,who employed nonviolent resistance to lead the successful campaign for india's independence from british rule, and in turn inspire movements for civil rights and freedom across the world.
the honorific mahātmā (sanskrit: "great-souled", "venerable"), first applied to him in 1914 in south africa, is now used throughout the world.
born and raised in a hindu family in coastal gujarat, western india, gandhi was trained in law at the inner temple, london, and called to the bar at age 22 in june 1891.  after two uncertain years in india, where he was unable to start a successful law practice, he moved to south africa in 1893 to represent an indian merchant in a lawsuit.
he went on to stay for 21 years.
it was in south africa that gandhi raised a family, and first employed nonviolent resistance in a campaign for civil rights.
in 1915, aged 45, he returned to india.
he set about organising peasants, farmers, and urban labourers to protest against excessive land-tax and discrimination.
assuming leadership of the indian national congress in 1921, gandhi led nationwide campaigns for easing poverty, expanding women's rights, building religious and ethnic amity, ending untouchability, and above all for achieving swaraj or self-rule.
the same year gandhi adopted the indian loincloth, or short dhoti and, in the winter, a shawl, both woven with yarn hand-spun on a traditional indian spinning wheel, or charkha, as a mark of identification with india's rural poor.
thereafter, he lived modestly in a self-sufficient residential community, ate simple vegetarian food, and undertook long fasts as a means of self-purification and political protest.
bringing anti-colonial nationalism to the common indians, gandhi led them in challenging the british-imposed salt tax with the 400 km (250 mi) dandi salt march in 1930, and later in calling for the british to quit india in 1942. he was imprisoned for many years, upon many occasions, in both south africa and india.
gandhi's vision of an independent india based on religious pluralism was challenged in the early 1940s by a new muslim nationalism which was demanding a separate muslim homeland carved out of india.
in august 1947, britain granted independence, but the british indian empire was partitioned into two dominions, a hindu-majority india and muslim-majority pakistan.
as many displaced hindus, muslims, and sikhs made their way to their new lands, religious violence broke out, especially in the punjab and bengal.
eschewing the official celebration of independence in delhi, gandhi visited the affected areas, attempting to provide solace.
in the months following, he undertook several fasts unto death to stop religious violence.
the last of these, undertaken on 12 january 1948 when he was 78, also had the indirect goal of pressuring india to pay out some cash assets owed to pakistan.
some indians thought gandhi was too accommodating.
among them was nathuram godse, a hindu nationalist, who assassinated gandhi on 30 january 1948 by firing three bullets into his chest.
gandhi's birthday, 2 october, is commemorated in india as gandhi jayanti, a national holiday, and worldwide as the international day of nonviolence.
gandhi is commonly, though not formally, considered the father of the nation in india, and was commonly called bapu (gujarati: endearment for father, papa).
mohandas karamchand gandhi was born on 2 october 1869 into an indian gujarati hindu modh baniya family in porbandar (also known as sudamapuri), a coastal town on the kathiawar peninsula and then part of the small princely state of porbandar in the kathiawar agency of the indian empire.
his father, karamchand uttamchand gandhi (1822–1885), served as the diwan (chief minister) of porbandar state.
although he only had an elementary education and had previously been a clerk in the state administration, karamchand proved a capable chief minister.
during his tenure, karamchand married four times.
his first two wives died young, after each had given birth to a daughter, and his third marriage was childless.
in 1857, karamchand sought his third wife's permission to remarry; that year, he married putlibai (1844–1891), who also came from junagadh, and was from a pranami vaishnava family.
karamchand and putlibai had three children over the ensuing decade: a son, laxmidas (c. 1860–1914); a daughter, raliatbehn (1862–1960); and another son, karsandas (c. 1866–1913).
on 2 october 1869, putlibai gave birth to her last child, mohandas, in a dark, windowless ground-floor room of the gandhi family residence in porbandar city.
as a child, gandhi was described by his sister raliat as "restless as mercury, either playing or roaming about.
one of his favourite pastimes was twisting dogs' ears."
the indian classics, especially the stories of shravana and king harishchandra, had a great impact on gandhi in his childhood.
in his autobiography, he admits that they left an indelible impression on his mind.
he writes: "it haunted me and i must have acted harishchandra to myself times without number."
gandhi's early self-identification with truth and love as supreme values is traceable to these epic characters.
the family's religious background was eclectic.
gandhi's father karamchand was hindu and his mother putlibai was from a pranami vaishnava hindu family.
gandhi's father was of modh baniya caste in the varna of vaishya.
his mother came from the medieval krishna bhakti-based pranami tradition, whose religious texts include the bhagavad gita, the bhagavata purana, and a collection of 14 texts with teachings that the tradition believes to include the essence of the vedas, the quran and the bible.
gandhi was deeply influenced by his mother, an extremely pious lady who "would not think of taking her meals without her daily prayers... she would take the hardest vows and keep them without flinching.
to keep two or three consecutive fasts was nothing to her."
in 1874, gandhi's father karamchand left porbandar for the smaller state of rajkot, where he became a counsellor to its ruler, the thakur sahib; though rajkot was a less prestigious state than porbandar, the british regional political agency was located there, which gave the state's diwan a measure of security.
in 1876, karamchand became diwan of rajkot and was succeeded as diwan of porbandar by his brother tulsidas.
his family then rejoined him in rajkot.
at age 9, gandhi entered the local school in rajkot, near his home.
there he studied the rudiments of arithmetic, history, the gujarati language and geography.
at age 11, he joined the high school in rajkot.
he was an average student, won some prizes, but was a shy and tongue tied student, with no interest in games; his only companions were books and school lessons.
in may 1883, the 13-year-old mohandas was married to 14-year-old kasturbai makhanji kapadia (her first name was usually shortened to "kasturba", and affectionately to "ba") in an arranged marriage, according to the custom of the region at that time.
in the process, he lost a year at school, but was later allowed to make up by accelerating his studies.
his wedding was a joint event, where his brother and cousin were also married.
recalling the day of their marriage, he once said, "as we didn't know much about marriage, for us it meant only wearing new clothes, eating sweets and playing with relatives."
as was prevailing tradition, the adolescent bride was to spend much time at her parents' house, and away from her husband.
writing many years later, mohandas described with regret the lustful feelings he felt for his young bride, "even at school i used to think of her, and the thought of nightfall and our subsequent meeting was ever haunting me."
he later recalled feeling jealous and possessive of her, such as when she would visit a temple with her girlfriends, and being sexually lustful in his feelings for her.
in late 1885, gandhi's father karamchand died.
gandhi, then 16 years old, and his wife of age 17 had their first baby, who survived only a few days.
the two deaths anguished gandhi.
the gandhi couple had four more children, all sons: harilal, born in 1888; manilal, born in 1892; ramdas, born in 1897; and devdas, born in 1900.
in november 1887, the 18-year-old gandhi graduated from high school in ahmedabad.
in january 1888, he enrolled at samaldas college in bhavnagar state, then the sole degree-granting institution of higher education in the region.
but he dropped out and returned to his family in porbandar.
gandhi came from a poor family, and he had dropped out of the cheapest college he could afford.
mavji dave joshiji, a brahmin priest and family friend, advised gandhi and his family that he should consider law studies in london.
in july 1888, his wife kasturba gave birth to their first surviving son, harilal.
his mother was not comfortable about gandhi leaving his wife and family, and going so far from home.
gandhi's uncle tulsidas also tried to dissuade his nephew.
gandhi wanted to go.
to persuade his wife and mother, gandhi made a vow in front of his mother that he would abstain from meat, alcohol and women.
gandhi's brother laxmidas, who was already a lawyer, cheered gandhi's london studies plan and offered to support him.
putlibai gave gandhi her permission and blessing.
on 10 august 1888, gandhi aged 18, left porbandar for mumbai, then known as bombay.
upon arrival, he stayed with the local modh bania community while waiting for the ship travel arrangements.
the head of the community knew gandhi's father.
after learning gandhi's plans, he and other elders warned gandhi that england would tempt him to compromise his religion, and eat and drink in western ways.
gandhi informed them of his promise to his mother and her blessings.
the local chief disregarded it, and excommunicated him from his caste.
but gandhi ignored this, and on 4 september, he sailed from bombay to london.
his brother saw him off.gandhi attended university college, london which is a constituent college of university of london.
at ucl, he studied law and jurisprudence and was invited to enroll at inner temple with the intention of becoming a barrister.
his childhood shyness and self withdrawal had continued through his teens, and he remained so when he arrived in london, but he joined a public speaking practice group and overcame this handicap to practise law.
his time in london was influenced by the vow he had made to his mother.
he tried to adopt "english" customs, including taking dancing lessons.
however, he could not appreciate the bland vegetarian food offered by his landlady and was frequently hungry until he found one of london's few vegetarian restaurants.
influenced by henry salt's writing, he joined the london vegetarian society and was elected to its executive committee under the aegis of its president and benefactor arnold hills.
an achievement while on the committee was the establishment of a bayswater chapter.
some of the vegetarians he met were members of the theosophical society, which had been founded in 1875 to further universal brotherhood, and which was devoted to the study of buddhist and hindu literature.
they encouraged gandhi to join them in reading the bhagavad gita both in translation as well as in the original.
gandhi had a friendly and productive relationship with hills, but the two men took a different view on the continued lvs membership of fellow committee member dr thomas allinson.
their disagreement is the first known example of gandhi challenging authority, despite his shyness and temperamental disinclination towards confrontation.
allinson had been promoting newly available birth control methods, but hills disapproved of these, believing they undermined public morality.
he believed vegetarianism to be a moral movement and that allinson should therefore no longer remain a member of the lvs.
gandhi shared hills views on the dangers of birth control, but defended allinson's right to differ.
it would have been hard for gandhi to challenge hills; hills was 12 years his senior and unlike gandhi, highly eloquent.
he bankrolled the lvs and was a captain of industry with his thames ironworks company employing more than 6,000 people in the east end of london.
he was also a highly accomplished sportsman who would go on to found the football club west ham united.
the question deeply interested me...i had a high regard for mr. hills and his generosity.
but i thought it was quite improper to exclude a man from a vegetarian society simply because he refused to regard puritan morals as one of the objects of the society
a motion to remove allinson was raised, and was debated and voted on by the committee.
gandhi’s shyness was an obstacle to his defence of allinson at the committee meeting.
he wrote his views down on paper but shyness prevented him reading out his arguments, so hills, the president, asked another committee member to read them out for him.
although some other members of the committee agreed with gandhi, the vote was lost and allinson excluded.
there were no hard feelings, with hills proposing the toast at the lvs farewell dinner in honour of gandhi’s return to india.
gandhi, at age 22, was called to the bar in june 1891 and then left london for india, where he learned that his mother had died while he was in london and that his family had kept the news from him.
his attempts at establishing a law practice in bombay failed because he was psychologically unable to cross-examine witnesses.
he returned to rajkot to make a modest living drafting petitions for litigants, but he was forced to stop when he ran afoul of a british officer sam sunny.
in 1893, a muslim merchant in kathiawar named dada abdullah contacted gandhi.
abdullah owned a large successful shipping business in south africa.
his distant cousin in johannesburg needed a lawyer, and they preferred someone with kathiawari heritage.
gandhi inquired about his pay for the work.
they offered a total salary of £105 (~$17,200 in 2019 money) plus travel expenses.
he accepted it, knowing that it would be at least a one-year commitment in the colony of natal, south africa, also a part of the british empire.
in april 1893, gandhi aged 23, set sail for south africa to be the lawyer for abdullah's cousin.
he spent 21 years in south africa, where he developed his political views, ethics and politics.
immediately upon arriving in south africa, gandhi faced discrimination because of his skin colour and heritage, like all people of colour.
he was not allowed to sit with european passengers in the stagecoach and told to sit on the floor near the driver, then beaten when he refused; elsewhere he was kicked into a gutter for daring to walk near a house, in another instance thrown off a train at pietermaritzburg after refusing to leave the first-class.
he sat in the train station, shivering all night and pondering if he should return to india or protest for his rights.
he chose to protest and was allowed to board the train the next day.
in another incident, the magistrate of a durban court ordered gandhi to remove his turban, which he refused to do.
indians were not allowed to walk on public footpaths in south africa.
gandhi was kicked by a police officer out of the footpath onto the street without warning.
when gandhi arrived in south africa, according to herman, he thought of himself as "a briton first, and an indian second".
however, the prejudice against him and his fellow indians from british people that gandhi experienced and observed deeply bothered him.
he found it humiliating, struggling to understand how some people can feel honour or superiority or pleasure in such inhumane practices.
gandhi began to question his people's standing in the british empire.
the abdullah case that had brought him to south africa concluded in may 1894, and the indian community organised a farewell party for gandhi as he prepared to return to india.
however, a new natal government discriminatory proposal led to gandhi extending his original period of stay in south africa.
he planned to assist indians in opposing a bill to deny them the right to vote, a right then proposed to be an exclusive european right.
he asked joseph chamberlain, the british colonial secretary, to reconsider his position on this bill.
though unable to halt the bill's passage, his campaign was successful in drawing attention to the grievances of indians in south africa.
he helped found the natal indian congress in 1894, and through this organisation, he moulded the indian community of south africa into a unified political force.
in january 1897, when gandhi landed in durban, a mob of white settlers attacked him and he escaped only through the efforts of the wife of the police superintendent.
however, he refused to press charges against any member of the mob.
during the boer war, gandhi volunteered in 1900 to form a group of stretcher-bearers as the natal indian ambulance corps.
according to arthur herman, gandhi wanted to disprove the imperial british stereotype that hindus were not fit for "manly" activities involving danger and exertion, unlike the muslim "martial races".
gandhi raised eleven hundred indian volunteers, to support british combat troops against the boers.
they were trained and medically certified to serve on the front lines.
they were auxiliaries at the battle of colenso to a white volunteer ambulance corps.
at the battle of spion kop gandhi and his bearers moved to the front line and had to carry wounded soldiers for miles to a field hospital because the terrain was too rough for the ambulances.
gandhi and thirty-seven other indians received the queen's south africa medal.
in 1906, the transvaal government promulgated a new act compelling registration of the colony's indian and chinese populations.
at a mass protest meeting held in johannesburg on 11 september that year, gandhi adopted his still evolving methodology of satyagraha (devotion to the truth), or nonviolent protest, for the first time.
according to anthony parel, gandhi was also influenced by the tamil text tirukkuṛaḷ because leo tolstoy mentioned it in their correspondence that began with "a letter to a hindu".
gandhi urged indians to defy the new law and to suffer the punishments for doing so.
gandhi's ideas of protests, persuasion skills and public relations had emerged.
he took these back to india in 1915.
gandhi focused his attention on indians while in south africa.
he was not interested in politics.
this changed after he was discriminated against and bullied, such as by being thrown out of a train coach because of his skin colour by a white train official.
after several such incidents with whites in south africa, gandhi's thinking and focus changed, and he felt he must resist this and fight for rights.
he entered politics by forming the natal indian congress.
according to ashwin desai and goolam vahed, gandhi's views on racism are contentious, and in some cases, distressing to those who admire him.
gandhi suffered persecution from the beginning in south africa.
like with other coloured people, white officials denied him his rights, and the press and those in the streets bullied and called him a "parasite", "semi-barbarous", "canker", "squalid coolie", "yellow man", and other epithets.
people would spit on him as an expression of racial hate.
while in south africa, gandhi focused on racial persecution of indians but ignored those of africans.
in some cases, state desai and vahed, his behaviour was one of being a willing part of racial stereotyping and african exploitation.
during a speech in september 1896, gandhi complained that the whites in the british colony of south africa were degrading indian hindus and muslims to "a level of kaffir".
scholars cite it as an example of evidence that gandhi at that time thought of indians and black south africans differently.
as another example given by herman, gandhi, at age 24, prepared a legal brief for the natal assembly in 1895, seeking voting rights for indians.
gandhi cited race history and european orientalists' opinions that "anglo-saxons and indians are sprung from the same aryan stock or rather the indo-european peoples", and argued that indians should not be grouped with the africans.
years later, gandhi and his colleagues served and helped africans as nurses and by opposing racism, according to the nobel peace prize winner nelson mandela.
the general image of gandhi, state desai and vahed, has been reinvented since his assassination as if he was always a saint, when in reality his life was more complex, contained inconvenient truths and was one that evolved over time.
in contrast, other africa scholars state the evidence points to a rich history of co-operation and efforts by gandhi and indian people with nonwhite south africans against persecution of africans and the apartheid.
in 1906, when the british declared war against the zulu kingdom in natal, gandhi at age 36, sympathised with the zulus and encouraged the indian volunteers to help as an ambulance unit.
he argued that indians should participate in the war efforts to change attitudes and perceptions of the british people against the coloured people.
gandhi, a group of 20 indians and black people of south africa volunteered as a stretcher-bearer corps to treat wounded british soldiers and the opposite side of the war: zulu victims.
white soldiers stopped gandhi and team from treating the injured zulu, and some african stretcher-bearers with gandhi were shot dead by the british.
the medical team commanded by gandhi operated for less than two months.
gandhi volunteering to help as a "staunch loyalist" during the zulu and other wars made no difference in the british attitude, states herman, and the african experience was a part of his great disillusionment with the west, transforming him into an "uncompromising non-cooperator".
in 1910, gandhi established, with the help of his friend hermann kallenbach, an idealistic community they named tolstoy farm near johannesburg.
there he nurtured his policy of peaceful resistance.
in the years after black south africans gained the right to vote in south africa (1994), gandhi was proclaimed a national hero with numerous monuments.
at the request of gopal krishna gokhale, conveyed to him by c. f. andrews, gandhi returned to india in 1915. he brought an international reputation as a leading indian nationalist, theorist and community organiser.
gandhi joined the indian national congress and was introduced to indian issues, politics and the indian people primarily by gokhale.
gokhale was a key leader of the congress party best known for his restraint and moderation, and his insistence on working inside the system.
gandhi took gokhale's liberal approach based on british whiggish traditions and transformed it to make it look indian.
gandhi took leadership of the congress in 1920 and began escalating demands until on 26 january 1930 the indian national congress declared the independence of india.
the british did not recognise the declaration but negotiations ensued, with the congress taking a role in provincial government in the late 1930s.
gandhi and the congress withdrew their support of the raj when the viceroy declared war on germany in september 1939 without consultation.
tensions escalated until gandhi demanded immediate independence in 1942 and the british responded by imprisoning him and tens of thousands of congress leaders.
meanwhile, the muslim league did co-operate with britain and moved, against gandhi's strong opposition, to demands for a totally separate muslim state of pakistan.
in august 1947 the british partitioned the land with india and pakistan each achieving independence on terms that gandhi disapproved.
in april 1918, during the latter part of world war i, the viceroy invited gandhi to a war conference in delhi.
gandhi agreed to actively recruit indians for the war effort.
in contrast to the zulu war of 1906 and the outbreak of world war i in 1914, when he recruited volunteers for the ambulance corps, this time gandhi attempted to recruit combatants.
in a june 1918 leaflet entitled "appeal for enlistment", gandhi wrote "to bring about such a state of things we should have the ability to defend ourselves, that is, the ability to bear arms and to use them... if we want to learn the use of arms with the greatest possible despatch, it is our duty to enlist ourselves in the army."
he did, however, stipulate in a letter to the viceroy's private secretary that he "personally will not kill or injure anybody, friend or foe."
gandhi's war recruitment campaign brought into question his consistency on nonviolence.
gandhi's private secretary noted that "the question of the consistency between his creed of 'ahimsa' (nonviolence) and his recruiting campaign was raised not only then but has been discussed ever since."
gandhi's first major achievement came in 1917 with the champaran agitation in bihar.
the champaran agitation pitted the local peasantry against their largely british landlords who were backed by the local administration.
the peasantry was forced to grow indigofera, a cash crop for indigo dye whose demand had been declining over two decades, and were forced to sell their crops to the planters at a fixed price.
unhappy with this, the peasantry appealed to gandhi at his ashram in ahmedabad.
pursuing a strategy of nonviolent protest, gandhi took the administration by surprise and won concessions from the authorities.
in 1918, kheda was hit by floods and famine and the peasantry was demanding relief from taxes.
gandhi moved his headquarters to nadiad, organising scores of supporters and fresh volunteers from the region, the most notable being vallabhbhai patel.
using non-co-operation as a technique, gandhi initiated a signature campaign where peasants pledged non-payment of revenue even under the threat of confiscation of land.
a social boycott of mamlatdars and talatdars (revenue officials within the district) accompanied the agitation.
gandhi worked hard to win public support for the agitation across the country.
for five months, the administration refused but finally in end-may 1918, the government gave way on important provisions and relaxed the conditions of payment of revenue tax until the famine ended.
in kheda, vallabhbhai patel represented the farmers in negotiations with the british, who suspended revenue collection and released all the prisoners.
every revolution begins with a single act of defiance.
in 1919, following world war i, gandhi (aged 49) sought political co-operation from muslims in his fight against british imperialism by supporting the ottoman empire that had been defeated in the world war.
before this initiative of gandhi, communal disputes and religious riots between hindus and muslims were common in british india, such as the riots of 1917–18.
gandhi had already supported the british crown with resources and by recruiting indian soldiers to fight the war in europe on the british side.
this effort of gandhi was in part motivated by the british promise to reciprocate the help with swaraj (self-government) to indians after the end of world war i. the british government, instead of self government, had offered minor reforms instead, disappointing gandhi.
gandhi announced his satyagraha (civil disobedience) intentions.
the british colonial officials made their counter move by passing the rowlatt act, to block gandhi's movement.
the act allowed the british government to treat civil disobedience participants as criminals and gave it the legal basis to arrest anyone for "preventive indefinite detention, incarceration without judicial review or any need for a trial".
gandhi felt that hindu-muslim co-operation was necessary for political progress against the british.
he leveraged the khilafat movement, wherein sunni muslims in india, their leaders such as the sultans of princely states in india and ali brothers championed the turkish caliph as a solidarity symbol of sunni islamic community (ummah).
they saw the caliph as their means to support islam and the islamic law after the defeat of ottoman empire in world war i. gandhi's support to the khilafat movement led to mixed results.
it initially led to a strong muslim support for gandhi.
however, the hindu leaders including rabindranath tagore questioned gandhi's leadership because they were largely against recognising or supporting the sunni islamic caliph in turkey.
the increasing muslim support for gandhi, after he championed the caliph's cause, temporarily stopped the hindu-muslim communal violence.
it offered evidence of inter-communal harmony in joint rowlatt satyagraha demonstration rallies, raising gandhi's stature as the political leader to the british.
his support for the khilafat movement also helped him sideline muhammad ali jinnah, who had announced his opposition to the satyagraha non-co-operation movement approach of gandhi.
jinnah began creating his independent support, and later went on to lead the demand for west and east pakistan.
by the end of 1922 the khilafat movement had collapsed.
turkey's ataturk had ended the caliphate, khilafat movement ended, and muslim support for gandhi largely evaporated.
muslim leaders and delegates abandoned gandhi and his congress.
hindu-muslim communal conflicts reignited.
deadly religious riots re-appeared in numerous cities, with 91 in united provinces of agra and oudh alone.
with his book hind swaraj (1909) gandhi, aged 40, declared that british rule was established in india with the co-operation of indians and had survived only because of this co-operation.
if indians refused to co-operate, british rule would collapse and swaraj would come.
in february 1919, gandhi cautioned the viceroy of india with a cable communication that if the british were to pass the rowlatt act, he would appeal to indians to start civil disobedience.
the british government ignored him and passed the law, stating it would not yield to threats.
the satyagraha civil disobedience followed, with people assembling to protest the rowlatt act.
on 30 march 1919, british law officers opened fire on an assembly of unarmed people, peacefully gathered, participating in satyagraha in delhi.
people rioted in retaliation.
on 6 april 1919, a hindu festival day, he asked a crowd to remember not to injure or kill british people, but to express their frustration with peace, to boycott british goods and burn any british clothing they owned.
he emphasised the use of non-violence to the british and towards each other, even if the other side uses violence.
communities across india announced plans to gather in greater numbers to protest.
government warned him to not enter delhi.
gandhi defied the order.
on 9 april, gandhi was arrested.
people rioted.
on 13 april 1919, people including women with children gathered in an amritsar park, and a british officer named reginald dyer surrounded them and ordered his troops to fire on them.
the resulting jallianwala bagh massacre (or amritsar massacre) of hundreds of sikh and hindu civilians enraged the subcontinent, but was cheered by some britons and parts of the british media as an appropriate response.
gandhi in ahmedabad, on the day after the massacre in amritsar, did not criticise the british and instead criticised his fellow countrymen for not exclusively using love to deal with the hate of the british government.
gandhi demanded that people stop all violence, stop all property destruction, and went on fast-to-death to pressure indians to stop their rioting.
the massacre and gandhi's non-violent response to it moved many, but also made some sikhs and hindus upset that dyer was getting away with murder.
investigation committees were formed by the british, which gandhi asked indians to boycott.
the unfolding events, the massacre and the british response, led gandhi to the belief that indians will never get a fair equal treatment under british rulers, and he shifted his attention to swaraj or self rule and political independence for india.
in 1921, gandhi was the leader of the indian national congress.
he reorganised the congress.
with congress now behind him, and muslim support triggered by his backing the khilafat movement to restore the caliph in turkey, gandhi had the political support and the attention of the british raj.
gandhi expanded his nonviolent non-co-operation platform to include the swadeshi policy – the boycott of foreign-made goods, especially british goods.
linked to this was his advocacy that khadi (homespun cloth) be worn by all indians instead of british-made textiles.
gandhi exhorted indian men and women, rich or poor, to spend time each day spinning khadi in support of the independence movement.
in addition to boycotting british products, gandhi urged the people to boycott british institutions and law courts, to resign from government employment, and to forsake british titles and honours.
gandhi thus began his journey aimed at crippling the british india government economically, politically and administratively.
the appeal of "non-cooperation" grew, its social popularity drew participation from all strata of indian society.
gandhi was arrested on 10 march 1922, tried for sedition, and sentenced to six years' imprisonment.
he began his sentence on 18 march 1922. with gandhi isolated in prison, the indian national congress split into two factions, one led by chitta ranjan das and motilal nehru favouring party participation in the legislatures, and the other led by chakravarti rajagopalachari and sardar vallabhbhai patel, opposing this move.
furthermore, co-operation among hindus and muslims ended as khilafat movement collapsed with the rise of ataturk in turkey.
muslim leaders left the congress and began forming muslim organisations.
the political base behind gandhi had broken into factions.
gandhi was released in february 1924 for an appendicitis operation, having served only two years.
after his early release from prison for political crimes in 1924, over the second half of the 1920s, gandhi continued to pursue swaraj.
he pushed through a resolution at the calcutta congress in december 1928 calling on the british government to grant india dominion status or face a new campaign of non-co-operation with complete independence for the country as its goal.
after his support for the world war i with indian combat troops, and the failure of khilafat movement in preserving the rule of caliph in turkey, followed by a collapse in muslim support for his leadership, some such as subhas chandra bose and bhagat singh questioned his values and non-violent approach.
while many hindu leaders championed a demand for immediate independence, gandhi revised his own call to a one-year wait, instead of two.
the british did not respond favourably to gandhi's proposal.
british political leaders such as lord birkenhead and winston churchill announced opposition to "the appeasers of gandhi", in their discussions with european diplomats who sympathised with indian demands.
on 31 december 1929, the flag of india was unfurled in lahore.
gandhi led congress celebrated 26 january 1930 as india's independence day in lahore.
this day was commemorated by almost every other indian organisation.
gandhi then launched a new satyagraha against the tax on salt in march 1930. gandhi sent an ultimatum in the form of a polite letter to the viceroy of india, lord irwin, on 2 march.
gandhi condemned british rule in the letter, describing it as "a curse" that "has impoverished the dumb millions by a system of progressive exploitation and by a ruinously expensive military and civil administration... it has reduced us politically to serfdom."
gandhi also mentioned in the letter that the viceroy received a salary "over five thousand times india's average income."
british violence, gandhi promised, was going to be defeated by indian non-violence.
this was highlighted by the salt march to dandi from 12 march to 6 april, where, together with 78 volunteers, he marched 388 kilometres (241 mi) from ahmedabad to dandi, gujarat to make salt himself, with the declared intention of breaking the salt laws.
the march took 25 days to cover 240 miles with gandhi speaking to often huge crowds along the way.
thousands of indians joined him in dandi.
on 5 may he was interned under a regulation dating from 1827 in anticipation of a protest that he had planned.
the protest at dharasana salt works on 21 may went ahead without its leader, gandhi.
a horrified american journalist, webb miller, described the british response thus:
in complete silence the gandhi men drew up and halted a hundred yards from the stockade.
a picked column advanced from the crowd, waded the ditches and approached the barbed wire stockade... at a word of command, scores of native policemen rushed upon the advancing marchers and rained blows on their heads with their steel-shot lathis [long bamboo sticks].
not one of the marchers even raised an arm to fend off blows.
they went down like ninepins.
from where i stood i heard the sickening whack of the clubs on unprotected skulls... those struck down fell sprawling, unconscious or writhing with fractured skulls or broken shoulders.
this went on for hours until some 300 or more protesters had been beaten, many seriously injured and two killed.
at no time did they offer any resistance.
this campaign was one of his most successful at upsetting british hold on india; britain responded by imprisoning over 60,000 people.
congress estimates, however, put the figure at 90,000. among them was one of gandhi's lieutenants, jawaharlal nehru.
according to sarma, gandhi recruited women to participate in the salt tax campaigns and the boycott of foreign products, which gave many women a new self-confidence and dignity in the mainstream of indian public life.
however, other scholars such as marilyn french state that gandhi barred women from joining his civil disobedience movement because he feared he would be accused of using women as political shield.
when women insisted that they join the movement and public demonstrations, according to thapar-bjorkert, gandhi asked the volunteers to get permissions of their guardians and only those women who can arrange child-care should join him.
regardless of gandhi's apprehensions and views, indian women joined the salt march by the thousands to defy the british salt taxes and monopoly on salt mining.
after gandhi's arrest, the women marched and picketed shops on their own, accepting violence and verbal abuse from british authorities for the cause in a manner gandhi inspired.
according to atlury murali, indian congress in the 1920s appealed to andhra pradesh peasants by creating telugu language plays that combined indian mythology and legends, linked them to gandhi's ideas, and portrayed gandhi as a messiah, a reincarnation of ancient and medieval indian nationalist leaders and saints.
the plays built support among peasants steeped in traditional hindu culture, according to murali, and this effort made gandhi a folk hero in telugu speaking villages, a sacred messiah-like figure.
according to dennis dalton, it was the ideas that were responsible for his wide following.
gandhi criticised western civilisation as one driven by "brute force and immorality", contrasting it with his categorisation of indian civilisation as one driven by "soul force and morality".
gandhi captured the imagination of the people of his heritage with his ideas about winning "hate with love".
these ideas are evidenced in his pamphlets from the 1890s, in south africa, where too he was popular among the indian indentured workers.
after he returned to india, people flocked to him because he reflected their values.
gandhi also campaigned hard going from one rural corner of the indian subcontinent to another.
he used terminology and phrases such as rama-rajya from ramayana, prahlada as a paradigmatic icon, and such cultural symbols as another facet of swaraj and satyagraha.
these ideas sounded strange outside india, during his lifetime, but they readily and deeply resonated with the culture and historic values of his people.
the government, represented by lord irwin, decided to negotiate with gandhi.
the gandhi–irwin pact was signed in march 1931. the british government agreed to free all political prisoners, in return for the suspension of the civil disobedience movement.
according to the pact, gandhi was invited to attend the round table conference in london for discussions and as the sole representative of the indian national congress.
the conference was a disappointment to gandhi and the nationalists.
gandhi expected to discuss india's independence, while the british side focused on the indian princes and indian minorities rather than on a transfer of power.
lord irwin's successor, lord willingdon, took a hard line against india as an independent nation, began a new campaign of controlling and subduing the nationalist movement.
gandhi was again arrested, and the government tried and failed to negate his influence by completely isolating him from his followers.
in britain, winston churchill, a prominent conservative politician who was then out of office but later became its prime minister, became a vigorous and articulate critic of gandhi and opponent of his long-term plans.
churchill often ridiculed gandhi, saying in a widely reported 1931 speech:
it is alarming and also nauseating to see mr gandhi, a seditious middle temple lawyer, now posing as a fakir of a type well known in the east, striding half-naked up the steps of the vice-regal palace....to parley on equal terms with the representative of the king-emperor.
churchill's bitterness against gandhi grew in the 1930s.
he called gandhi as the one who was "seditious in aim" whose evil genius and multiform menace was attacking the british empire.
churchill called him a dictator, a "hindu mussolini", fomenting a race war, trying to replace the raj with brahmin cronies, playing on the ignorance of indian masses, all for selfish gain.
churchill attempted to isolate gandhi, and his criticism of gandhi was widely covered by european and american press.
it gained churchill sympathetic support, but it also increased support for gandhi among europeans.
the developments heightened churchill's anxiety that the "british themselves would give up out of pacifism and misplaced conscience".
during the discussions between gandhi and the british government over 1931–32 at the round table conferences, gandhi, now aged about 62, sought constitutional reforms as a preparation to the end of colonial british rule, and begin the self-rule by indians.
the british side sought reforms that would keep indian subcontinent as a colony.
the british negotiators proposed constitutional reforms on a british dominion model that established separate electorates based on religious and social divisions.
the british questioned the congress party and gandhi's authority to speak for all of india.
they invited indian religious leaders, such as muslims and sikhs, to press their demands along religious lines, as well as b. r. ambedkar as the representative leader of the untouchables.
gandhi vehemently opposed a constitution that enshrined rights or representations based on communal divisions, because he feared that it would not bring people together but divide them, perpetuate their status and divert the attention from india's struggle to end the colonial rule.
the second round table conference was the only time he left india between 1914 and his death in 1948. he declined the government's offer of accommodation in an expensive west end hotel, preferring to stay in the east end, to live among working-class people, as he did in india.
he based himself in a small cell-bedroom at kingsley hall for the three-month duration of his stay and was enthusiastically received by east enders.
during this time he renewed his links with the british vegetarian movement.
after gandhi returned from the second round table conference, he started a new satyagraha.
he was arrested and imprisoned at the yerwada jail, pune.
while he was in prison, the british government enacted a new law that granted untouchables a separate electorate.
it came to be known as the communal award.
in protest, gandhi started a fast-unto-death, while he was held in prison.
the resulting public outcry forced the government, in consultations with ambedkar, to replace the communal award with a compromise poona pact.
in 1934 gandhi resigned from congress party membership.
he did not disagree with the party's position but felt that if he resigned, his popularity with indians would cease to stifle the party's membership, which actually varied, including communists, socialists, trade unionists, students, religious conservatives, and those with pro-business convictions, and that these various voices would get a chance to make themselves heard.
gandhi also wanted to avoid being a target for raj propaganda by leading a party that had temporarily accepted political accommodation with the raj.
gandhi returned to active politics again in 1936, with the nehru presidency and the lucknow session of the congress.
although gandhi wanted a total focus on the task of winning independence and not speculation about india's future, he did not restrain the congress from adopting socialism as its goal.
gandhi had a clash with subhas chandra bose, who had been elected president in 1938, and who had previously expressed a lack of faith in nonviolence as a means of protest.
despite gandhi's opposition, bose won a second term as congress president, against gandhi's nominee, dr. pattabhi sitaramayya; but left the congress when the all-india leaders resigned en masse in protest of his abandonment of the principles introduced by gandhi.
gandhi declared that sitaramayya's defeat was his defeat.
gandhi opposed providing any help to the british war effort and he campaigned against any indian participation in the world war ii.
gandhi's campaign did not enjoy the support of indian masses and many indian leaders such as sardar patel and rajendra prasad.
his campaign was a failure.
over 2.5 million indians ignored gandhi, volunteered and joined the british military to fight on various fronts of the allied forces.
gandhi opposition to the indian participation in the world war ii was motivated by his belief that india could not be party to a war ostensibly being fought for democratic freedom while that freedom was denied to india itself.
he also condemned nazism and fascism, a view which won endorsement of other indian leaders.
as the war progressed, gandhi intensified his demand for independence, calling for the british to quit india in a 1942 speech in mumbai.
this was gandhi's and the congress party's most definitive revolt aimed at securing the british exit from india.
the british government responded quickly to the quit india speech, and within hours after gandhi's speech arrested gandhi and all the members of the congress working committee.
his countrymen retaliated the arrests by damaging or burning down hundreds of government owned railway stations, police stations, and cutting down telegraph wires.
in 1942, gandhi now nearing age 73, urged his people to completely stop co-operating with the imperial government.
in this effort, he urged that they neither kill nor injure british people, but be willing to suffer and die if violence is initiated by the british officials.
he clarified that the movement would not be stopped because of any individual acts of violence, saying that the "ordered anarchy" of "the present system of administration" was "worse than real anarchy."
he urged indians to karo ya maro ("do or die") in the cause of their rights and freedoms.
gandhi's arrest lasted two years, as he was held in the aga khan palace in pune.
during this period, his long time secretary mahadev desai died of a heart attack, his wife kasturba died after 18 months' imprisonment on 22 february 1944; and gandhi suffered a severe malaria attack.
while in jail, he agreed to an interview with stuart gelder, a british journalist.
gelder then composed and released an interview summary, cabled it to the mainstream press, that announced sudden concessions gandhi was willing to make, comments that shocked his countrymen, the congress workers and even gandhi.
the latter two claimed that it distorted what gandhi actually said on a range of topics and falsely repudiated the quit india movement.
gandhi was released before the end of the war on 6 may 1944 because of his failing health and necessary surgery; the raj did not want him to die in prison and enrage the nation.
he came out of detention to an altered political scene – the muslim league for example, which a few years earlier had appeared marginal, "now occupied the centre of the political stage" and the topic of muhammad ali jinnah's campaign for pakistan was a major talking point.
gandhi and jinnah had extensive correspondence and the two men met several times over a period of two weeks in september 1944, where gandhi insisted on a united religiously plural and independent india which included muslims and non-muslims of the indian subcontinent coexisting.
jinnah rejected this proposal and insisted instead for partitioning the subcontinent on religious lines to create a separate muslim india (later pakistan).
these discussions continued through 1947.
while the leaders of congress languished in jail, the other parties supported the war and gained organizational strength.
underground publications flailed at the ruthless suppression of congress, but it had little control over events.
at the end of the war, the british gave clear indications that power would be transferred to indian hands.
at this point gandhi called off the struggle, and around 100,000 political prisoners were released, including the congress's leadership.
gandhi opposed partition of the indian subcontinent along religious lines.
the indian national congress and gandhi called for the british to quit india.
however, the muslim league demanded "divide and quit india".
gandhi suggested an agreement which required the congress and the muslim league to co-operate and attain independence under a provisional government, thereafter, the question of partition could be resolved by a plebiscite in the districts with a muslim majority.
jinnah rejected gandhi's proposal and called for direct action day, on 16 august 1946, to press muslims to publicly gather in cities and support his proposal for partition of indian subcontinent into a muslim state and non-muslim state.
huseyn shaheed suhrawardy, the muslim league chief minister of bengal – now bangladesh and west bengal, gave calcutta's police special holiday to celebrate the direct action day.
the direct action day triggered a mass murder of calcutta hindus and the torching of their property, and holidaying police were missing to contain or stop the conflict.
the british government did not order its army to move in to contain the violence.
the violence on direct action day led to retaliatory violence against muslims across india.
thousands of hindus and muslims were murdered, and tens of thousands were injured in the cycle of violence in the days that followed.
gandhi visited the most riot-prone areas to appeal a stop to the massacres.
archibald wavell, the viceroy and governor-general of british india for three years through february 1947, had worked with gandhi and jinnah to find a common ground, before and after accepting indian independence in principle.
wavell condemned gandhi's character and motives as well as his ideas.
wavell accused gandhi of harbouring the single minded idea to "overthrow british rule and influence and to establish a hindu raj", and called gandhi a "malignant, malevolent, exceedingly shrewd" politician.
wavell feared a civil war on the indian subcontinent, and doubted gandhi would be able to stop it.
the british reluctantly agreed to grant independence to the people of the indian subcontinent, but accepted jinnah's proposal of partitioning the land into pakistan and india.
gandhi was involved in the final negotiations, but stanley wolpert states the "plan to carve up british india was never approved of or accepted by gandhi".
the partition was controversial and violently disputed.
more than half a million were killed in religious riots as 10 million to 12 million non-muslims (hindus and sikhs mostly) migrated from pakistan into india, and muslims migrated from india into pakistan, across the newly created borders of india, west pakistan and east pakistan.
gandhi spent the day of independence not celebrating the end of the british rule but appealing for peace among his countrymen by fasting and spinning in calcutta on 15 august 1947. the partition had gripped the indian subcontinent with religious violence and the streets were filled with corpses.
some writers credit gandhi's fasting and protests for stopping the religious riots and communal violence.
at 5:17 pm on 30 january 1948, gandhi was with his grandnieces in the garden of birla house (now gandhi smriti), on his way to address a prayer meeting, when nathuram godse, a hindu nationalist, fired three bullets into his chest from a pistol at close range.
according to some accounts, gandhi died instantly.
in other accounts, such as one prepared by an eyewitness journalist, gandhi was carried into the birla house, into a bedroom.
there he died about 30 minutes later as one of gandhi's family members read verses from hindu scriptures.
prime minister jawaharlal nehru addressed his countrymen over the all-india radio saying:
friends and comrades, the light has gone out of our lives, and there is darkness everywhere, and i do not quite know what to tell you or how to say it.
our beloved leader, bapu as we called him, the father of the nation, is no more.
perhaps i am wrong to say that; nevertheless, we will not see him again, as we have seen him for these many years, we will not run to him for advice or seek solace from him, and that is a terrible blow, not only for me, but for millions and millions in this country.
godse, a hindu nationalist with links to the extremist hindu mahasabha, made no attempt to escape; several other conspirators were soon arrested as well.
they were tried in court at delhi's red fort.
at his trial, godse did not deny the charges nor express any remorse.
according to claude markovits, a french historian noted for his studies of colonial india, godse stated that he killed gandhi because of his complacence towards muslims, holding gandhi responsible for the frenzy of violence and sufferings during the subcontinent's partition into pakistan and india.
godse accused gandhi of subjectivism and of acting as if only he had a monopoly of the truth.
godse was found guilty and executed in 1949.
gandhi's death was mourned nationwide.
over a million people joined the five-mile long funeral procession that took over five hours to reach raj ghat from birla house, where he was assassinated, and another million watched the procession pass by.
gandhi's body was transported on a weapons carrier, whose chassis was dismantled overnight to allow a high-floor to be installed so that people could catch a glimpse of his body.
the engine of the vehicle was not used; instead four drag-ropes manned by 50 people each pulled the vehicle.
all indian-owned establishments in london remained closed in mourning as thousands of people from all faiths and denominations and indians from all over britain converged at india house in london.
gandhi's assassination dramatically changed the political landscape.
nehru became his political heir.
according to markovits, while gandhi was alive, pakistan's declaration that it was a "muslim state" had led indian groups to demand that it be declared a "hindu state".
nehru used gandhi's martyrdom as a political weapon to silence all advocates of hindu nationalism as well as his political challengers.
he linked gandhi's assassination to politics of hatred and ill-will.
according to guha, nehru and his congress colleagues called on indians to honour gandhi's memory and even more his ideals.
nehru used the assassination to consolidate the authority of the new indian state.
gandhi's death helped marshal support for the new government and legitimise the congress party's control, leveraged by the massive outpouring of hindu expressions of grief for a man who had inspired them for decades.
the government suppressed the rss, the muslim national guards, and the khaksars, with some 200,000 arrests.
for years after the assassination, states markovits, "gandhi's shadow loomed large over the political life of the new indian republic".
the government quelled any opposition to its economic and social policies, despite these being contrary to gandhi's ideas, by reconstructing gandhi's image and ideals.
gandhi was cremated in accordance with hindu tradition.
gandhi's ashes were poured into urns which were sent across india for memorial services.
most of the ashes were immersed at the sangam at allahabad on 12 february 1948, but some were secretly taken away.
in 1997, tushar gandhi immersed the contents of one urn, found in a bank vault and reclaimed through the courts, at the sangam at allahabad.
some of gandhi's ashes were scattered at the source of the nile river near jinja, uganda, and a memorial plaque marks the event.
on 30 january 2008, the contents of another urn were immersed at girgaum chowpatty.
another urn is at the palace of the aga khan in pune (where gandhi was held as a political prisoner from 1942 to 1944) and another in the self-realization fellowship lake shrine in los angeles.
the birla house site where gandhi was assassinated is now a memorial called gandhi smriti.
the place near yamuna river where he was cremated is the rāj ghāt memorial in new delhi.
a black marble platform, it bears the epigraph "hē rāma" (devanagari: हे !
राम or, hey raam).
these are widely believed to be gandhi's last words after he was shot, though the veracity of this statement has been disputed.
gandhi's statements, letters and life have attracted much political and scholarly analysis of his principles, practices and beliefs, including what influenced him.
some writers present him as a paragon of ethical living and pacifism, while others present him as a more complex, contradictory and evolving character influenced by his culture and circumstances.
gandhi grew up in a hindu and jain religious atmosphere in his native gujarat, which were his primary influences, but he was also influenced by his personal reflections and literature of hindu bhakti saints, advaita vedanta, islam, buddhism, christianity, and thinkers such as tolstoy, ruskin and thoreau.
at age 57 he declared himself to be advaitist hindu in his religious persuasion, but added that he supported dvaitist viewpoints and religious pluralism.
gandhi was influenced by his devout vaishnava hindu mother, the regional hindu temples and saint tradition which co-existed with jain tradition in gujarat.
historian r.b.
cribb states that gandhi's thought evolved over time, with his early ideas becoming the core or scaffolding for his mature philosophy.
he committed himself early to truthfulness, temperance, chastity, and vegetarianism.
gandhi's london lifestyle incorporated the values he had grown up with.
when he returned to india in 1891, his outlook was parochial and he could not make a living as a lawyer.
this challenged his belief that practicality and morality necessarily coincided.
by moving in 1893 to south africa he found a solution to this problem and developed the central concepts of his mature philosophy.
according to bhikhu parekh, three books that influenced gandhi most in south africa were william salter's ethical religion (1889); henry david thoreau's on the duty of civil disobedience (1849); and leo tolstoy's the kingdom of god is within you (1894).
ruskin inspired his decision to live an austere life on a commune, at first on the phoenix farm in natal and then on the tolstoy farm just outside johannesburg, south africa.
the most profound influence on gandhi were those from hinduism, christianity and jainism, states parekh, with his thoughts "in harmony with the classical indian traditions, specially the advaita or monistic tradition".
according to indira carr and others, gandhi was influenced by vaishnavism, jainism and advaita vedanta.
balkrishna gokhale states that gandhi was influenced by hinduism and jainism, and his studies of sermon on the mount of christianity, ruskin and tolstoy.
additional theories of possible influences on gandhi have been proposed.
for example, in 1935, n. a. toothi stated that gandhi was influenced by the reforms and teachings of the swaminarayan tradition of hinduism.
according to raymond williams, toothi may have overlooked the influence of the jain community, and adds close parallels do exist in programs of social reform in the swaminarayan tradition and those of gandhi, based on "nonviolence, truth-telling, cleanliness, temperance and upliftment of the masses."
historian howard states the culture of gujarat influenced gandhi and his methods.
along with the book mentioned above, in 1908 leo tolstoy wrote a letter to a hindu, which said that only by using love as a weapon through passive resistance could the indian people overthrow colonial rule.
in 1909, gandhi wrote to tolstoy seeking advice and permission to republish a letter to a hindu in gujarati.
tolstoy responded and the two continued a correspondence until tolstoy's death in 1910 (tolstoy's last letter was to gandhi).
the letters concern practical and theological applications of nonviolence.
gandhi saw himself a disciple of tolstoy, for they agreed regarding opposition to state authority and colonialism; both hated violence and preached non-resistance.
however, they differed sharply on political strategy.
gandhi called for political involvement; he was a nationalist and was prepared to use nonviolent force.
he was also willing to compromise.
it was at tolstoy farm where gandhi and hermann kallenbach systematically trained their disciples in the philosophy of nonviolence.
gandhi credited shrimad rajchandra, a poet and jain philosopher, as his influential counsellor.
in modern review, june 1930, gandhi wrote about their first encounter in 1891 at dr. p.j.
mehta's residence in bombay.
gandhi exchanged letters with rajchandra when he was in south africa, referring to him as kavi (literally, "poet").
in 1930, gandhi wrote, "such was the man who captivated my heart in religious matters as no other man ever has till now."
'i have said elsewhere that in moulding my inner life tolstoy and ruskin vied with kavi.
but kavi's influence was undoubtedly deeper if only because i had come in closest personal touch with him.'
gandhi, in his autobiography, called rajchandra his "guide and helper" and his "refuge [...] in moments of spiritual crisis".
he had advised gandhi to be patient and to study hinduism deeply.
during his stay in south africa, along with scriptures and philosophical texts of hinduism and other indian religions, gandhi read translated texts of christianity such as the bible, and islam such as the quran.
a quaker mission in south africa attempted to convert him to christianity.
gandhi joined them in their prayers and debated christian theology with them, but refused conversion stating he did not accept the theology therein or that christ was the only son of god.
his comparative studies of religions and interaction with scholars, led him to respect all religions as well as become concerned about imperfections in all of them and frequent misinterpretations.
gandhi grew fond of hinduism, and referred to the bhagavad gita as his spiritual dictionary and greatest single influence on his life.
gandhi was acquainted with sufi islam's chishti order during his stay in south africa.
he attended khanqah gatherings there at riverside.
according to margaret chatterjee, gandhi as a vaishnava hindu shared values such as humility, devotion and brotherhood for the poor that is also found in sufism.
winston churchill also compared gandhi to a sufi fakir.
gandhi participated in the south african war against the boers, on the british side in 1899. both the dutch settlers called boers and the imperial british at that time discriminated against the coloured races they considered as inferior, and gandhi later wrote about his conflicted beliefs during the boer war.
he stated that "when the war was declared, my personal sympathies were all with the boers, but my loyalty to the british rule drove me to participation with the british in that war".
according to gandhi, he felt that since he was demanding his rights as a british citizen, it was also his duty to serve the british forces in the defence of the british empire.
during world war i (1914–1918), nearing the age of 50, gandhi supported the british and its allied forces by recruiting indians to join the british army, expanding the indian contingent from about 100,000 to over 1.1 million.
he encouraged indian people to fight on one side of the war in europe and africa at the cost of their lives.
pacifists criticised and questioned gandhi, who defended these practices by stating, according to sankar ghose, "it would be madness for me to sever my connection with the society to which i belong".
according to keith robbins, the recruitment effort was in part motivated by the british promise to reciprocate the help with swaraj (self-government) to indians after the end of world war i. after the war, the british government offered minor reforms instead, which disappointed gandhi.
he launched his satyagraha movement in 1919. in parallel, gandhi's fellowmen became sceptical of his pacifist ideas and were inspired by the ideas of nationalism and anti-imperialism.
in a 1920 essay, after the world war i, gandhi wrote, "where there is only a choice between cowardice and violence, i would advise violence."
rahul sagar interprets gandhi's efforts to recruit for the british military during the war, as gandhi's belief that, at that time, it would demonstrate that indians were willing to fight.
further, it would also show the british that his fellow indians were "their subjects by choice rather than out of cowardice."
in 1922, gandhi wrote that abstinence from violence is effective and true forgiveness only when one has the power to punish, not when one decides not to do anything because one is helpless.
after world war ii engulfed britain, gandhi actively campaigned to oppose any help to the british war effort and any indian participation in the war.
according to arthur herman, gandhi believed that his campaign would strike a blow to imperialism.
gandhi's position was not supported by many indian leaders, and his campaign against the british war effort was a failure.
the hindu leader, tej bahadur sapru, declared in 1941, states herman, "a good many congress leaders are fed up with the barren program of the mahatma".
over 2.5 million indians ignored gandhi, volunteered and joined on the british side.
they fought and died as a part of the allied forces in europe, north africa and various fronts of the world war ii.
gandhi dedicated his life to discovering and pursuing truth, or satya, and called his movement satyagraha, which means "appeal to, insistence on, or reliance on the truth".
the first formulation of the satyagraha as a political movement and principle occurred in 1920, which he tabled as "resolution on non-cooperation" in september that year before a session of the indian congress.
it was the satyagraha formulation and step, states dennis dalton, that deeply resonated with beliefs and culture of his people, embedded him into the popular consciousness, transforming him quickly into mahatma.
gandhi based satyagraha on the vedantic ideal of self-realization, ahimsa (nonviolence), vegetarianism, and universal love.
william borman states that the key to his satyagraha is rooted in the hindu upanishadic texts.
according to indira carr, gandhi's ideas on ahimsa and satyagraha were founded on the philosophical foundations of advaita vedanta.
i. bruce watson states that some of these ideas are found not only in traditions within hinduism, but also in jainism or buddhism, particularly those about non-violence, vegetarianism and universal love, but gandhi's synthesis was to politicise these ideas.
gandhi's concept of satya as a civil movement, states glyn richards, are best understood in the context of the hindu terminology of dharma and ṛta.
gandhi stated that the most important battle to fight was overcoming his own demons, fears, and insecurities.
gandhi summarised his beliefs first when he said "god is truth".
he would later change this statement to "truth is god".
thus, satya (truth) in gandhi's philosophy is "god".
gandhi, states richards, described the term "god" not as a separate power, but as the being (brahman, atman) of the advaita vedanta tradition, a nondual universal that pervades in all things, in each person and all life.
according to nicholas gier, this to gandhi meant the unity of god and humans, that all beings have the same one soul and therefore equality, that atman exists and is same as everything in the universe, ahimsa (non-violence) is the very nature of this atman.
the essence of satyagraha is "soul force" as a political means, refusing to use brute force against the oppressor, seeking to eliminate antagonisms between the oppressor and the oppressed, aiming to transform or "purify" the oppressor.
it is not inaction but determined passive resistance and non-co-operation where, states arthur herman, "love conquers hate".
a euphemism sometimes used for satyagraha is that it is a "silent force" or a "soul force" (a term also used by martin luther king jr. during his "i have a dream" speech).
it arms the individual with moral power rather than physical power.
satyagraha is also termed a "universal force", as it essentially "makes no distinction between kinsmen and strangers, young and old, man and woman, friend and foe."
gandhi wrote: "there must be no impatience, no barbarity, no insolence, no undue pressure.
if we want to cultivate a true spirit of democracy, we cannot afford to be intolerant.
intolerance betrays want of faith in one's cause."
civil disobedience and non-co-operation as practised under satyagraha are based on the "law of suffering", a doctrine that the endurance of suffering is a means to an end.
this end usually implies a moral upliftment or progress of an individual or society.
therefore, non-co-operation in satyagraha is in fact a means to secure the co-operation of the opponent consistently with truth and justice.
while gandhi's idea of satyagraha as a political means attracted a widespread following among indians, the support was not universal.
for example, muslim leaders such as jinnah opposed the satyagraha idea, accused gandhi to be reviving hinduism through political activism, and began effort to counter gandhi with muslim nationalism and a demand for muslim homeland.
the untouchability leader ambedkar, in june 1945, after his decision to convert to buddhism and a key architect of the constitution of modern india, dismissed gandhi's ideas as loved by "blind hindu devotees", primitive, influenced by spurious brew of tolstoy and ruskin, and "there is always some simpleton to preach them".
winston churchill caricatured gandhi as a "cunning huckster" seeking selfish gain, an "aspiring dictator", and an "atavistic spokesman of a pagan hinduism".
churchill stated that the civil disobedience movement spectacle of gandhi only increased "the danger to which white people there [british india] are exposed".
although gandhi was not the originator of the principle of nonviolence, he was the first to apply it in the political field on a large scale.
the concept of nonviolence (ahimsa) has a long history in indian religious thought, with it being considered the highest dharma (ethical value virtue), a precept to be observed towards all living beings (sarvbhuta), at all times (sarvada), in all respects (sarvatha), in action, words and thought.
gandhi explains his philosophy and ideas about ahimsa as a political means in his autobiography the story of my experiments with truth.
gandhi was criticised for refusing to protest the hanging of bhagat singh, sukhdev, udham singh and rajguru.
he was accused of accepting a deal with the king's representative irwin that released civil disobedience leaders from prison and accepted the death sentence against the highly popular revolutionary bhagat singh, who at his trial had replied, "revolution is the inalienable right of mankind".
gandhi's views came under heavy criticism in britain when it was under attack from nazi germany, and later when the holocaust was revealed.
he told the british people in 1940, "i would like you to lay down the arms you have as being useless for saving you or humanity.
you will invite herr hitler and signor mussolini to take what they want of the countries you call your possessions... if these gentlemen choose to occupy your homes, you will vacate them.
if they do not give you free passage out, you will allow yourselves, man, woman, and child, to be slaughtered, but you will refuse to owe allegiance to them."
george orwell remarked that gandhi's methods confronted 'an old-fashioned and rather shaky despotism which treated him in a fairly chivalrous way', not a totalitarian power, 'where political opponents simply disappear.'
in a post-war interview in 1946, he said, "hitler killed five million jews.
it is the greatest crime of our time.
but the jews should have offered themselves to the butcher's knife.
they should have thrown themselves into the sea from cliffs... it would have aroused the world and the people of germany... as it is they succumbed anyway in their millions."
gandhi believed this act of "collective suicide", in response to the holocaust, "would have been heroism".
gandhi believed that buddhism, jainism and sikhism were traditions of hinduism, with shared history, rites and ideas.
at other times, he acknowledged that he knew little about buddhism other than his reading of edwin arnold's book on it.
based on that book, he considered buddhism to be a reform movement and the buddha to be a hindu.
he stated he knew jainism much more, and he credited jains to have profoundly influenced him.
sikhism, to gandhi, was an integral part of hinduism, in the form of another reform movement.
sikh and buddhist leaders disagreed with gandhi, a disagreement gandhi respected as a difference of opinion.
gandhi had generally positive and empathetic views of islam, and he extensively studied the quran.
he viewed islam as a faith that proactively promoted peace, and felt that non-violence had a predominant place in the quran.
he also read the islamic prophet muhammad's biography, and argued that it was "not the sword that won a place for islam in those days in the scheme of life.
it was the rigid simplicity, the utter self-effacement of the prophet, the scrupulous regard for pledges, his intense devotion to his friends and followers, his intrepidity, his fearlessness, his absolute trust in god and in his own mission."
gandhi had a large indian muslim following, who he encouraged to join him in a mutual nonviolent jihad against the social oppression of their time.
prominent muslim allies in his nonviolent resistance movement included maulana abul kalam azad and abdul ghaffar khan.
however, gandhi's empathy towards islam, and his eager willingness to valorise peaceful muslim social activists, was viewed by many hindus as an appeasement of muslims and later became a leading cause for his assassination at the hands of intolerant hindu extremists.
while gandhi expressed mostly positive views of islam, he did occasionally criticise muslims.
he stated in 1925 that he did not criticise the teachings of the quran, but he did criticise the interpreters of the quran.
gandhi believed that numerous interpreters have interpreted it to fit their preconceived notions.
he believed muslims should welcome criticism of the quran, because "every true scripture only gains from criticism".
gandhi criticised muslims who "betray intolerance of criticism by a non-muslim of anything related to islam", such as the penalty of stoning to death under islamic law.
to gandhi, islam has "nothing to fear from criticism even if it be unreasonable".
he also believed there were material contradictions between hinduism and islam, and he criticised muslims along with communists that were quick to resort to violence.
one of the strategies gandhi adopted was to work with muslim leaders of pre-partition india, to oppose the british imperialism in and outside the indian subcontinent.
after the world war i, in 1919–22, he won muslim leadership support of ali brothers by backing the khilafat movement in favour the islamic caliph and his historic ottoman caliphate, and opposing the secular islam supporting mustafa kemal atatürk.
by 1924, ataturk had ended the caliphate, the khilafat movement was over, and muslim support for gandhi had largely evaporated.
in 1925, gandhi gave another reason to why he got involved in the khilafat movement and the middle east affairs between britain and the ottoman empire.
gandhi explained to his co-religionists (hindu) that he sympathised and campaigned for the islamic cause, not because he cared for the sultan, but because "i wanted to enlist the mussalman's sympathy in the matter of cow protection".
according to the historian m. naeem qureshi, like the then indian muslim leaders who had combined religion and politics, gandhi too imported his religion into his political strategy during the khilafat movement.
in the 1940s, gandhi pooled ideas with some muslim leaders who sought religious harmony like him, and opposed the proposed partition of british india into india and pakistan.
for example, his close friend badshah khan suggested that they should work towards opening hindu temples for muslim prayers, and islamic mosques for hindu prayers, to bring the two religious groups closer.
gandhi accepted this and began having muslim prayers read in hindu temples to play his part, but was unable to get hindu prayers read in mosques.
the hindu nationalist groups objected and began confronting gandhi for this one-sided practice, by shouting and demonstrating inside the hindu temples, in the last years of his life.
gandhi criticised as well as praised christianity.
he was critical of christian missionary efforts in british india, because they mixed medical or education assistance with demands that the beneficiary convert to christianity.
according to gandhi, this was not true "service" but one driven by ulterior motive of luring people into religious conversion and exploiting the economically or medically desperate.
it did not lead to inner transformation or moral advance or to the christian teaching of "love", but was based on false one-sided criticisms of other religions, when christian societies faced similar problems in south africa and europe.
it led to the converted person hating his neighbours and other religions, it divided people rather than bringing them closer in compassion.
according to gandhi, "no religious tradition could claim a monopoly over truth or salvation".
gandhi did not support laws to prohibit missionary activity, but demanded that christians should first understand the message of jesus, and then strive to live without stereotyping and misrepresenting other religions.
according to gandhi, the message of jesus was not to humiliate and imperialistically rule over other people considering them inferior or second class or slaves, but that "when the hungry are fed and peace comes to our individual and collective life, then christ is born".
gandhi believed that his long acquaintance with christianity had made him like it as well as find it imperfect.
he asked christians to stop humiliating his country and his people as heathens, idolators and other abusive language, and to change their negative views of india.
he believed that christians should introspect on the "true meaning of religion" and get a desire to study and learn from indian religions in the spirit of universal brotherhood.
according to eric sharpe – a professor of religious studies, though gandhi was born in a hindu family and later became hindu by conviction, many christians in time thought of him as an "exemplary christian and even as a saint".
some colonial era christian preachers and faithfuls considered gandhi as a saint.
biographers from france and britain have drawn parallels between gandhi and christian saints.
recent scholars question these romantic biographies and state that gandhi was neither a christian figure nor mirrored a christian saint.
gandhi's life is better viewed as exemplifying his belief in the "convergence of various spiritualities" of a christian and a hindu, states michael de saint-cheron.
according to kumaraswamy, gandhi initially supported arab demands with respect to palestine.
he justified this support by invoking islam, stating that "non-muslims cannot acquire sovereign jurisdiction" in jazirat al-arab (the arabian peninsula).
these arguments, states kumaraswamy, were a part of his political strategy to win muslim support during the khilafat movement.
in the post-khilafat period, gandhi neither negated jewish demands nor did he use islamic texts or history to support muslim claims against israel.
gandhi's silence after the khilafat period may represent an evolution in his understanding of the conflicting religious claims over palestine, according to kumaraswamy.
in 1938, gandhi spoke in favour of jewish claims, and in march 1946, he said to the member of british parliament sidney silverman, "if the arabs have a claim to palestine, the jews have a prior claim", a position very different from his earlier stance.
gandhi discussed the persecution of the jews in germany and the emigration of jews from europe to palestine through his lens of satyagraha.
in 1937, gandhi discussed zionism with his close jewish friend hermann kallenbach.
he said that zionism was not the right answer to the problems faced by jews and instead recommended satyagraha.
gandhi thought the zionists in palestine represented european imperialism and used violence to achieve their goals; he argued that "the jews should disclaim any intention of realizing their aspiration under the protection of arms and should rely wholly on the goodwill of arabs.
no exception can possibly be taken to the natural desire of the jews to find a home in palestine.
but they must wait for its fulfillment till arab opinion is ripe for it."
in 1938, gandhi stated that his "sympathies are all with the jews.
i have known them intimately in south africa.
some of them became life-long companions."
philosopher martin buber was highly critical of gandhi's approach and in 1939 wrote an open letter to him on the subject.
gandhi reiterated his stance that "the jews seek to convert the arab heart", and use "satyagraha in confronting the arabs" in 1947. according to simone panter-brick, gandhi's political position on jewish-arab conflict evolved over the 1917-1947 period, shifting from a support for the arab position first, and for the jewish position in the 1940s.
gandhi was brought up as a vegetarian by his devout hindu mother.
the idea of vegetarianism is deeply ingrained in hindu vaishnavism and jain traditions in india, such as in his native gujarat, where meat is considered as a form of food obtained by violence to animals.
gandhi's rationale for vegetarianism was largely along those found in hindu and jain texts.
gandhi believed that any form of food inescapably harms some form of living organism, but one should seek to understand and reduce the violence in what one consumes because "there is essential unity of all life".
gandhi believed that some life forms are more capable of suffering, and non-violence to him meant not having the intent as well as active efforts to minimise hurt, injury or suffering to all life forms.
gandhi explored food sources that reduced violence to various life forms in the food chain.
he believed that slaughtering animals is unnecessary, as other sources of foods are available.
he also consulted with vegetarianism campaigners during his lifetime, such as with henry stephens salt.
food to gandhi was not only a source of sustaining one's body, but a source of his impact on other living beings, and one that affected his mind, character and spiritual well being.
he avoided not only meat, but also eggs and milk.
gandhi wrote the book the moral basis of vegetarianism and wrote for the london vegetarian society's publication.
beyond his religious beliefs, gandhi stated another motivation for his experiments with diet.
he attempted to find the most non-violent vegetarian meal that the poorest human could afford, taking meticulous notes on vegetables and fruits, and his observations with his own body and his ashram in gujarat.
he tried fresh and dry fruits (fruitarianism), then just sun dried fruits, before resuming his prior vegetarian diet on advice of his doctor and concerns of his friends.
his experiments with food began in the 1890s and continued for several decades.
for some of these experiments, gandhi combined his own ideas with those found on diet in indian yoga texts.
he believed that each vegetarian should experiment with his or her diet because, in his studies at his ashram he saw "one man's food may be poison for another".
gandhi championed animal rights in general.
other than making vegetarian choices, he actively campaigned against dissection studies and experimentation on live animals (vivisection) in the name of science and medical studies.
he considered it a violence against animals, something that inflicted pain and suffering.
he wrote, "vivisection in my opinion is the blackest of all the blackest crimes that man is at present committing against god and his fair creation."
gandhi used fasting as a political device, often threatening suicide unless demands were met.
congress publicised the fasts as a political action that generated widespread sympathy.
in response the government tried to manipulate news coverage to minimise his challenge to the raj.
he fasted in 1932 to protest the voting scheme for separate political representation for dalits; gandhi did not want them segregated.
the british government stopped the london press from showing photographs of his emaciated body, because it would elicit sympathy.
gandhi's 1943 hunger strike took place during a two-year prison term for the anticolonial quit india movement.
the government called on nutritional experts to demystify his action, and again no photos were allowed.
however, his final fast in 1948, after the end of british rule in india, his hunger strike was lauded by the british press and this time did include full-length photos.
alter states that gandhi's fasting, vegetarianism and diet was more than a political leverage, it was a part of his experiments with self restraint and healthy living.
he was "profoundly skeptical of traditional ayurveda", encouraging it to study the scientific method and adopt its progressive learning approach.
gandhi believed yoga offered health benefits.
he believed that a healthy nutritional diet based on regional foods and hygiene were essential to good health.
recently icmr made gandhi's health records public in a book 'gandhi and health@150'.
these records indicate that despite being underweight at 46.7 kg gandhi was generally healthy.
he avoided modern medication and experimented extensively with water and earth healing.
while his cardio records show his heart was normal, there were several instances he suffered from ailments like malaria and was also operated on twice for piles and appendicitis.
despite health challenges gandhi was able to walk about 79000 kms in his lifetime which comes to an average of 18 kms per day and is equivalent to walking around the earth twice.
gandhi strongly favoured the emancipation of women, and urged "the women to fight for their own self-development."
he opposed purdah, child marriage, dowry and sati.
a wife is not a slave of the husband, stated gandhi, but his comrade, better half, colleague and friend, according to lyn norvell.
in his own life however, according to suruchi thapar-bjorkert, gandhi's relationship with his wife were at odds with some of these values.
at various occasions, gandhi credited his orthodox hindu mother, and his wife, for first lessons in satyagraha.
he used the legends of hindu goddess sita to expound women's innate strength, autonomy and "lioness in spirit" whose moral compass can make any demon "as helpless as a goat".
to gandhi, the women of india were an important part of the "swadeshi movement" (buy indian), and his goal of decolonising the indian economy.
some historians such as angela woollacott and kumari jayawardena state that even though gandhi often and publicly expressed his belief in the equality of sexes, yet his vision was one of gender difference and complementarity between them.
women, to gandhi, should be educated to be better in the domestic realm and educate the next generation.
his views on women's rights were less liberal and more similar to puritan-victorian expectations of women, states jayawardena, than other hindu leaders with him who supported economic independence and equal gender rights in all aspects.
along with many other texts, gandhi studied bhagavad gita while in south africa.
this hindu scripture discusses jnana yoga, bhakti yoga and karma yoga along with virtues such as non-violence, patience, integrity, lack of hypocrisy, self restraint and abstinence.
gandhi began experiments with these, and in 1906 at age 37, although married and a father, he vowed to abstain from sexual relations.
gandhi's experiment with abstinence went beyond sex, and extended to food.
he consulted the jain scholar rajchandra, whom he fondly called raychandbhai.
rajchandra advised him that milk stimulated sexual passion.
gandhi began abstaining from cow's milk in 1912, and did so even when doctors advised him to consume milk.
according to sankar ghose, tagore described gandhi as someone who did not abhor sex or women, but considered sexual life as inconsistent with his moral goals.
gandhi tried to test and prove to himself his brahmacharya.
the experiments began some time after the death of his wife in february 1944. at the start of his experiment he had women sleep in the same room but in different beds.
he later slept with women in the same bed but clothed, and finally he slept naked with women.
in april 1945, gandhi referenced being naked with several "women or girls" in a letter to birla as part of the experiments.
according to the 1960s memoir of his grandniece manu, gandhi feared in early 1947 that he and she may be killed by muslims in the run up to india's independence in august 1947, and asked her when she was 18 years old if she wanted to help him with his experiments to test their "purity", for which she readily accepted.
gandhi slept naked in the same bed with manu with the bedroom doors open all night.
manu stated that the experiment had no "ill effect" on her.
gandhi also shared his bed with 18-year-old abha, wife of his grandnephew kanu.
gandhi would sleep with both manu and abha at the same time.
none of the women who participated in the brahmachari experiments of gandhi indicated that they had sex or that gandhi behaved in any sexual way.
those who went public said they felt as though they were sleeping with their ageing mother.
according to sean scalmer, gandhi in his final year of life was an ascetic, and his sickly skeletal figure was caricatured in western media.
in february 1947, he asked his confidants such as birla and ramakrishna if it was wrong for him to experiment his brahmacharya oath.
gandhi's public experiments, as they progressed, were widely discussed and criticised by his family members and leading politicians.
however, gandhi said that if he would not let manu sleep with him, it would be a sign of weakness.
some of his staff resigned, including two of his newspaper's editors who had refused to print some of gandhi's sermons dealing with his experiments.
nirmalkumar bose, gandhi's bengali interpreter, for example criticised gandhi, not because gandhi did anything wrong, but because bose was concerned about the psychological effect on the women who participated in his experiments.
veena howard states gandhi's views on brahmacharya and religious renunciation experiments were a method to confront women issues in his times.
gandhi spoke out against untouchability early in his life.
before 1932, he and his associates used the word antyaja for untouchables.
in a major speech on untouchability at nagpur in 1920, gandhi called it a great evil in hindu society but observed that it was not unique to hinduism, having deeper roots, and stated that europeans in south africa treated "all of us, hindus and muslims, as untouchables; we may not reside in their midst, nor enjoy the rights which they do".
calling the doctrine of untouchability intolerable, he asserted that the practice could be eradicated, that hinduism was flexible enough to allow eradication, and that a concerted effort was needed to persuade people of the wrong and to urge them to eradicate it.
according to christophe jaffrelot, while gandhi considered untouchability to be wrong and evil, he believed that caste or class is based on neither inequality nor inferiority.
gandhi believed that individuals should freely intermarry whomever they wish, but that no one should expect everyone to be his friend: every individual, regardless of background, has a right to choose whom he will welcome into his home, whom he will befriend, and whom he will spend time with.
in 1932, gandhi began a new campaign to improve the lives of the untouchables, whom he began to call harijans, "the children of god".
on 8 may 1933, gandhi began a 21-day fast of self-purification and launched a year-long campaign to help the harijan movement.
this campaign was not universally embraced by the dalit community: ambedkar and his allies felt gandhi was being paternalistic and was undermining dalit political rights.
ambedkar described him as "devious and untrustworthy".
he accused gandhi as someone who wished to retain the caste system.
ambedkar and gandhi debated their ideas and concerns, each trying to persuade the other.
in 1935, ambedkar announced his intentions to leave hinduism and join buddhism.
according to sankar ghose, the announcement shook gandhi, who reappraised his views and wrote many essays with his views on castes, intermarriage, and what hinduism says on the subject.
these views contrasted with those of ambedkar.
yet in the elections of 1937, excepting some seats in mumbai which ambedkar's party won, india's untouchables voted heavily in favour of gandhi's campaign and his party, the congress.
gandhi and his associates continued to consult ambedkar, keeping him influential.
ambedkar worked with other congress leaders through the 1940s and wrote large parts of india's constitution in the late 1940s, but did indeed convert to buddhism in 1956. according to jaffrelot, gandhi's views evolved between the 1920s and 1940s; by 1946, he actively encouraged intermarriage between castes.
his approach, too, to untouchability differed from ambedkar's, championing fusion, choice, and free intermixing, while ambedkar envisioned each segment of society maintaining its group identity, and each group then separately advancing the "politics of equality".
ambedkar's criticism of gandhi continued to influence the dalit movement past gandhi's death.
according to arthur herman, ambedkar's hatred for gandhi and gandhi's ideas was so strong that, when he heard of gandhi's assassination, he remarked after a momentary silence a sense of regret and then added, "my real enemy is gone; thank goodness the eclipse is over now".
according to ramachandra guha, "ideologues have carried these old rivalries into the present, with the demonization of gandhi now common among politicians who presume to speak in ambedkar's name."
gandhi rejected the colonial western format of education system.
he stated that it led to disdain for manual work, generally created an elite administrative bureaucracy.
gandhi favoured an education system with far greater emphasis on learning skills in practical and useful work, one that included physical, mental and spiritual studies.
his methodology sought to treat all professions equal and pay everyone the same.
gandhi called his ideas nai talim (literally, 'new education').
he believed that the western style education violated and destroyed the indigenous cultures.
a different basic education model, he believed, would lead to better self awareness, prepare people to treat all work equally respectable and valued, and lead to a society with less social diseases.
nai talim evolved out of his experiences at the tolstoy farm in south africa, and gandhi attempted to formulate the new system at the sevagram ashram after 1937. nehru government's vision of an industrialised, centrally planned economy after 1947 had scant place for gandhi's village-oriented approach.
in his autobiography, gandhi wrote that he believed every hindu boy and girl must learn sanskrit because its historic and spiritual texts are in that language.
gandhi believed that swaraj not only can be attained with non-violence, it can be run with non-violence.
a military is unnecessary, because any aggressor can be thrown out using the method of non-violent non-co-operation.
while military is unnecessary in a nation organised under swaraj principle, gandhi added that a police force is necessary given human nature.
however, the state would limit the use of weapons by the police to the minimum, aiming for their use as a restraining force.
according to gandhi, a non-violent state is like an "ordered anarchy".
in a society of mostly non-violent individuals, those who are violent will sooner or later accept discipline or leave the community, stated gandhi.
he emphasised a society where individuals believed more in learning about their duties and responsibilities, not demanded rights and privileges.
on returning from south africa, when gandhi received a letter asking for his participation in writing a world charter for human rights, he responded saying, "in my experience, it is far more important to have a charter for human duties."
swaraj to gandhi did not mean transferring colonial era british power brokering system, favours-driven, bureaucratic, class exploitative structure and mindset into indian hands.
he warned such a transfer would still be english rule, just without the englishman.
"this is not the swaraj i want", said gandhi.
tewari states that gandhi saw democracy as more than a system of government; it meant promoting both individuality and the self-discipline of the community.
democracy meant settling disputes in a nonviolent manner; it required freedom of thought and expression.
for gandhi, democracy was a way of life.
some scholars state gandhi supported a religiously diverse india, while others state that the muslim leaders who championed the partition and creation of a separate muslim pakistan considered gandhi to be hindu nationalist or revivalist.
for example, in his letters to mohammad iqbal, jinnah accused gandhi to be favouring a hindu rule and revivalism, that gandhi led indian national congress was a fascist party.
in an interview with c.f.
andrews, gandhi stated that if we believe all religions teach the same message of love and peace between all human beings, then there is neither any rationale nor need for proselytisation or attempts to convert people from one religion to another.
gandhi opposed missionary organisations who criticised indian religions then attempted to convert followers of indian religions to islam or christianity.
in gandhi's view, those who attempt to convert a hindu, "they must harbour in their breasts the belief that hinduism is an error" and that their own religion is "the only true religion".
gandhi believed that people who demand religious respect and rights must also show the same respect and grant the same rights to followers of other religions.
he stated that spiritual studies must encourage "a hindu to become a better hindu, a mussalman to become a better mussalman, and a christian a better christian."
according to gandhi, religion is not about what a man believes, it is about how a man lives, how he relates to other people, his conduct towards others, and one's relationship to one's conception of god.
it is not important to convert or to join any religion, but it is important to improve one's way of life and conduct by absorbing ideas from any source and any religion, believed gandhi.
gandhi believed in sarvodaya economic model, which literally means "welfare, upliftment of all".
this, states bhatt, was a very different economic model than the socialism model championed and followed by free india by nehru – india's first prime minister.
to both, according to bhatt, removing poverty and unemployment were the objective, but the gandhian economic and development approach preferred adapting technology and infrastructure to suit the local situation, in contrast to nehru's large scale, socialised state owned enterprises.
to gandhi, the economic philosophy that aims at "greatest good for the greatest number" was fundamentally flawed, and his alternative proposal sarvodaya set its aim at the "greatest good for all".
he believed that the best economic system not only cared to lift the "poor, less skilled, of impoverished background" but also empowered to lift the "rich, highly skilled, of capital means and landlords".
violence against any human being, born poor or rich, is wrong, believed gandhi.
he stated that the mandate theory of majoritarian democracy should not be pushed to absurd extremes, individual freedoms should never be denied, and no person should ever be made a social or economic slave to the "resolutions of majorities".
gandhi challenged nehru and the modernizers in the late 1930s who called for rapid industrialisation on the soviet model; gandhi denounced that as dehumanising and contrary to the needs of the villages where the great majority of the people lived.
after gandhi's assassination, nehru led india in accordance with his personal socialist convictions.
historian kuruvilla pandikattu says "it was nehru's vision, not gandhi's, that was eventually preferred by the indian state."
gandhi called for ending poverty through improved agriculture and small-scale cottage rural industries.
gandhi's economic thinking disagreed with marx, according to the political theory scholar and economist bhikhu parekh.
gandhi refused to endorse the view that economic forces are best understood as "antagonistic class interests".
he argued that no man can degrade or brutalise the other without degrading and brutalising himself and that sustainable economic growth comes from service, not from exploitation.
further, believed gandhi, in a free nation, victims exist only when they co-operate with their oppressor, and an economic and political system that offered increasing alternatives gave power of choice to the poorest man.
while disagreeing with nehru about the socialist economic model, gandhi also critiqued capitalism that was driven by endless wants and a materialistic view of man.
this, he believed, created a vicious vested system of materialism at the cost of other human needs such as spirituality and social relationships.
to gandhi, states parekh, both communism and capitalism were wrong, in part because both focussed exclusively on materialistic view of man, and because the former deified the state with unlimited power of violence, while the latter deified capital.
he believed that a better economic system is one which does not impoverish one's culture and spiritual pursuits.
gandhism designates the ideas and principles gandhi promoted; of central importance is nonviolent resistance.
a gandhian can mean either an individual who follows, or a specific philosophy which is attributed to, gandhism.
m. m. sankhdher argues that gandhism is not a systematic position in metaphysics or in political philosophy.
rather, it is a political creed, an economic doctrine, a religious outlook, a moral precept, and especially, a humanitarian world view.
it is an effort not to systematise wisdom but to transform society and is based on an undying faith in the goodness of human nature.
however gandhi himself did not approve of the notion of "gandhism", as he explained in 1936:
there is no such thing as "gandhism", and i do not want to leave any sect after me.
i do not claim to have originated any new principle or doctrine.
i have simply tried in my own way to apply the eternal truths to our daily life and problems...the opinions i have formed and the conclusions i have arrived at are not final.
i may change them tomorrow.
i have nothing new to teach the world.
truth and nonviolence are as old as the hills.
gandhi was a prolific writer.
one of gandhi's earliest publications, hind swaraj, published in gujarati in 1909, became "the intellectual blueprint" for india's independence movement.
the book was translated into english the next year, with a copyright legend that read "no rights reserved".
for decades he edited several newspapers including harijan in gujarati, in hindi and in the english language; indian opinion while in south africa and, young india, in english, and navajivan, a gujarati monthly, on his return to india.
later, navajivan was also published in hindi.
in addition, he wrote letters almost every day to individuals and newspapers.
gandhi also wrote several books including his autobiography, the story of my experiments with truth (gujarātī "સત્યના પ્રયોગો અથવા આત્મકથા"), of which he bought the entire first edition to make sure it was reprinted.
his other autobiographies included: satyagraha in south africa about his struggle there, hind swaraj or indian home rule, a political pamphlet, and a paraphrase in gujarati of john ruskin's unto this last.
this last essay can be considered his programme on economics.
he also wrote extensively on vegetarianism, diet and health, religion, social reforms, etc.
gandhi usually wrote in gujarati, though he also revised the hindi and english translations of his books.
gandhi's complete works were published by the indian government under the name the collected works of mahatma gandhi in the 1960s.
the writings comprise about 50,000 pages published in about a hundred volumes.
in 2000, a revised edition of the complete works sparked a controversy, as it contained a large number of errors and omissions.
the indian government later withdrew the revised edition.
gandhi influenced important leaders and political movements.
leaders of the civil rights movement in the united states, including martin luther king jr., james lawson, and james bevel, drew from the writings of gandhi in the development of their own theories about nonviolence.
king said "christ gave us the goals and mahatma gandhi the tactics."
king sometimes referred to gandhi as "the little brown saint."
anti-apartheid activist and former president of south africa, nelson mandela, was inspired by gandhi.
others include khan abdul ghaffar khan, steve biko, and aung san suu kyi.
in his early years, the former president of south africa nelson mandela was a follower of the nonviolent resistance philosophy of gandhi.
bhana and vahed commented on these events as "gandhi inspired succeeding generations of south african activists seeking to end white rule.
this legacy connects him to nelson mandela...in a sense mandela completed what gandhi started."
gandhi's life and teachings inspired many who specifically referred to gandhi as their mentor or who dedicated their lives to spreading gandhi's ideas.
in europe, romain rolland was the first to discuss gandhi in his 1924 book mahatma gandhi, and brazilian anarchist and feminist maria lacerda de moura wrote about gandhi in her work on pacifism.
in 1931, notable european physicist albert einstein exchanged written letters with gandhi, and called him "a role model for the generations to come" in a letter writing about him.
einstein said of gandhi:
mahatma gandhi's life achievement stands unique in political history.
he has invented a completely new and humane means for the liberation war of an oppressed country, and practised it with greatest energy and devotion.
the moral influence he had on the consciously thinking human being of the entire civilised world will probably be much more lasting than it seems in our time with its overestimation of brutal violent forces.
because lasting will only be the work of such statesmen who wake up and strengthen the moral power of their people through their example and educational works.
we may all be happy and grateful that destiny gifted us with such an enlightened contemporary, a role model for the generations to come.generations to come will scarce believe that such a one as this walked the earth in flesh and blood.
lanza del vasto went to india in 1936 intending to live with gandhi; he later returned to europe to spread gandhi's philosophy and founded the community of the ark in 1948 (modelled after gandhi's ashrams).
madeleine slade (known as "mirabehn") was the daughter of a british admiral who spent much of her adult life in india as a devotee of gandhi.
in addition, the british musician john lennon referred to gandhi when discussing his views on nonviolence.
at the cannes lions international advertising festival in 2007, former us vice-president and environmentalist al gore spoke of gandhi's influence on him.
us president barack obama in a 2010 address to the parliament of india said that:
i am mindful that i might not be standing before you today, as president of the united states, had it not been for gandhi and the message he shared with america and the world.
obama in september 2009 said that his biggest inspiration came from gandhi.
his reply was in response to the question 'who was the one person, dead or live, that you would choose to dine with?'.
he continued that "he's somebody i find a lot of inspiration in.
he inspired dr. king with his message of nonviolence.
he ended up doing so much and changed the world just by the power of his ethics."
time magazine named the 14th dalai lama, lech wałęsa, martin luther king jr., cesar chavez, aung san suu kyi, benigno aquino, jr., desmond tutu, and nelson mandela as children of gandhi and his spiritual heirs to nonviolence.
the mahatma gandhi district in houston, texas, united states, an ethnic indian enclave, is officially named after gandhi.
gandhi's ideas had a significant influence on 20th-century philosophy.
it began with his engagement with romain rolland and martin buber.
jean-luc nancy said that the french philosopher maurice blanchot engaged critically with gandhi from the point of view of "european spirituality".
since then philosophers including hannah arendt, etienne balibar and slavoj žižek found that gandhi was a necessary reference to discuss morality in politics.
recently in the light of climate change gandhi's views on technology are gaining importance in the fields of environmental philosophy and philosophy of technology.
in 2007, the united nations general assembly declared gandhi's birthday 2 october as "the international day of nonviolence."
first proposed by unesco in 1948, as the school day of nonviolence and peace (denip in spanish), 30 january is observed as the school day of nonviolence and peace in schools of many countries in countries with a southern hemisphere school calendar, it is observed on 30 march.
time magazine named gandhi the man of the year in 1930. the university of nagpur awarded him an ll.d.
in 1937. gandhi was also the runner-up to albert einstein as "person of the century" at the end of 1999. the government of india awarded the annual gandhi peace prize to distinguished social workers, world leaders and citizens.
nelson mandela, the leader of south africa's struggle to eradicate racial discrimination and segregation, was a prominent non-indian recipient.
in 2011, time magazine named gandhi as one of the top 25 political icons of all time.
gandhi did not receive the nobel peace prize, although he was nominated five times between 1937 and 1948, including the first-ever nomination by the american friends service committee, though he made the short list only twice, in 1937 and 1947. decades later, the nobel committee publicly declared its regret for the omission, and admitted to deeply divided nationalistic opinion denying the award.
gandhi was nominated in 1948 but was assassinated before nominations closed.
that year, the committee chose not to award the peace prize stating that "there was no suitable living candidate" and later research shows that the possibility of awarding the prize posthumously to gandhi was discussed and that the reference to no suitable living candidate was to gandhi.
geir lundestad, secretary of norwegian nobel committee in 2006 said, "the greatest omission in our 106-year history is undoubtedly that mahatma gandhi never received the nobel peace prize.
gandhi could do without the nobel peace prize, whether nobel committee can do without gandhi is the question".
when the 14th dalai lama was awarded the prize in 1989, the chairman of the committee said that this was "in part a tribute to the memory of mahatma gandhi".
in the summer of 1995, the north american vegetarian society inducted him posthumously into the vegetarian hall of fame.
indians widely describe gandhi as the father of the nation.
origin of this title is traced back to a radio address (on singapore radio) on 6 july 1944 by subhash chandra bose where bose addressed gandhi as "the father of the nation".
on 28 april 1947, sarojini naidu during a conference also referred gandhi as "father of the nation".
however, in response to an rti application in 2012, the government of india stated that the constitution of india did not permit any titles except ones acquired through education or military service.
a five-hour nine-minute long biographical documentary film, mahatma: life of gandhi, 1869–1948, made by vithalbhai jhaveri in 1968, quoting gandhi's words and using black & white archival footage and photographs, captures the history of those times.

the 1979 opera satyagraha by american composer philip glass is loosely based on gandhi's life.
the opera's libretto, taken from the bhagavad gita, is sung in the original sanskrit.
anti-gandhi themes have also been showcased through films and plays.
the 1995 marathi play gandhi virudh gandhi explored the relationship between gandhi and his son harilal.
the 2007 film, gandhi, my father was inspired on the same theme.
the 1989 marathi play me nathuram godse boltoy and the 1997 hindi play gandhi ambedkar criticised gandhi and his principles.
several biographers have undertaken the task of describing gandhi's life.
among them are d. g. tendulkar with his mahatma.
life of mohandas karamchand gandhi in eight volumes, chaman nahal's gandhi quartet, and pyarelal and sushila nayyar with their mahatma gandhi in 10 volumes.
the 2010 biography, great soul: mahatma gandhi and his struggle with india by joseph lelyveld contained controversial material speculating about gandhi's sexual life.
lelyveld, however, stated that the press coverage "grossly distort[s]" the overall message of the book.
the 2014 film welcome back gandhi takes a fictionalised look at how gandhi might react to modern day india.
the 2019 play bharat bhagya vidhata, inspired by pujya gurudevshri rakeshbhai and produced by sangeet natak akademi and shrimad rajchandra mission dharampur takes a look at how gandhi cultivated the values of truth and non-violence.
"mahatma gandhi" is used by cole porter in his lyrics for the song you're the top which is included in the 1934 musical anything goes.
in the song porter rhymes "mahatma gandhi' with "napoleon brandy."
india, with its rapid economic modernisation and urbanisation, has rejected gandhi's economics but accepted much of his politics and continues to revere his memory.
reporter jim yardley notes that, "modern india is hardly a gandhian nation, if it ever was one.
his vision of a village-dominated economy was shunted aside during his lifetime as rural romanticism, and his call for a national ethos of personal austerity and nonviolence has proved antithetical to the goals of an aspiring economic and military power."
by contrast gandhi is "given full credit for india's political identity as a tolerant, secular democracy."
gandhi's birthday, 2 october, is a national holiday in india, gandhi jayanti.
gandhi's image also appears on paper currency of all denominations issued by reserve bank of india, except for the one rupee note.

the gandhi memorial in kanyakumari resembles central indian hindu temples and the tamukkam or summer palace in madurai now houses the mahatma gandhi museum.
gandhi's children and grandchildren live in india and other countries.
grandson rajmohan gandhi is a professor in illinois and an author of gandhi's biography titled mohandas, while another, tarun gandhi, has authored several authoritative books on his grandfather.
another grandson, kanu ramdas gandhi (the son of gandhi's third son ramdas), was found living in an old age home in delhi despite having taught earlier in the united states.
the brazilian expeditionary force (portuguese: força expedicionária brasileira, feb) consisted of about 25,900 men and women arranged by the army and air force to fight alongside the allied forces in the mediterranean theatre of world war ii.
this air–land force consisted of (replacements included) a complete infantry division, a liaison flight, and a fighter squadron.
it fought in italy from september 1944 to may 1945, while the brazilian navy as well as the air force also acted in the battle of the atlantic from the middle of 1942 until the end of the war.
during the almost eight months of its campaign, fighting at the gothic line and in the 1945 final offensive, the feb took 20,573 axis prisoners, consisting of two generals, 892 officers, and 19,679 other ranks.
brazil was the only independent south american country to send ground troops to fight overseas during the second world war, losing 948 men killed in action across all three services.
brazil's participation alongside the allied powers in world war ii was by no means a foregone conclusion, even though brazil (along with japan and romania) had supported the triple entente in world war i.  then brazilian participation (1917–1918) was primarily naval, although it did send a "military mission" to the western front.
as in 1914, brazil in 1939 maintained a position of neutrality, initially trading with both the allies and the axis powers.
as the war progressed, trade with the axis countries became almost impossible and the us began forceful diplomatic and economic efforts to bring brazil onto the allied side.
these efforts led to the creation of the joint brazil-us defense commission, which was chaired by james garesche ord and worked to strengthen military ties between the two countries during the war.
it was designed to reduce the likelihood of axis attacks on us shipping as soldiers traveled across the atlantic to africa and europe, and minimized the influence of the axis in south america.
at the beginning of 1942, brazil permitted the us to set up air bases on their territory in return for the offer by the us to encourage the formation of a steel industry - companhia siderúrgica nacional, in brazil.
the us bases were located in the states of bahia, pernambuco and rio grande do norte, where the city of natal hosted part of the us navy's vp-52.
in addition, us task force 3 established itself in brazil.
this included a squadron equipped to attack submarines and merchant vessels attempting to trade with japan.
although brazil remained neutral, this increasing cooperation with the allies led the brazilian government to announce at the pan american states conference in rio, on 28 january 1942, its decision to sever diplomatic relations with germany, japan, and italy.
as a result, from the end of january to july 1942, although no declaration of war yet existed between germany and brazil, german u-boats sank 13 brazilian merchant vessels.
in august 1942, u-507 alone sank five brazilian vessels in two days, causing more than 600 deaths:
in all, 21 german and 2 italian submarines caused the sinking of 36 brazilian merchant ships involving 1,691 drownings and 1,079 other casualties.
the sinkings were the reason that led the brazilian government to declare war against the axis.
berlin radio pronouncements led to increasing nervousness among the brazilian population, so unlike 1917, in 1942 it seemed that the brazilian government did not want war.
in some cities like rio de janeiro, the people started to protest against such a situation which included some harassment of german communities.
the passive position of the vargas government proved untenable in the face of public opinion.
ultimately, the government found itself with no alternative but to declare war on germany and italy on august 22, 1942.
the decision regarding the creation of the feb came after the potenji river conference, a meeting between president franklin d. roosevelt and getulio vargas, which was held in natal, rio grande do norte on board a destroyer of the u.s. navy.
this conference took place in 28 and 29 january 1943 right after president roosevelt took part on the casablanca conference in morocco.
the participation of the brazilian navy in world war ii was not directly connected to the feb and the italian campaign, having been largely engaged in the battle of the atlantic.
as a result of the axis attacks, brazil suffered nearly 1,600 dead, including almost 500 civilians and more than 1,000 of brazil's 7,000 sailors involved in the conflict.
the naval losses included 470 sailors of the merchant marine and 570 sailors of the navy, a total of 36 ships sunk by the germans, and more than 350 dead in three accidental sinkings.
the main task of the brazilian navy was, together with the allies, to ensure the safety of ships sailing between the central and south atlantic to gibraltar.
alone or in coordination with allied forces, it escorted 614 convoys that protected 3,164 merchant and transport troop ships; in the battle against german submarines, brazilian frigates and submarines used mines and depth charges.
according to german documents, the brazilian navy attacked german submarines a total of 66 times.
along the brazilian coast, the destruction of twelve axis submarines (one italian and eleven german) has been verified: italian submarine archimede, u-128, u-161, u-164, u-199, u-507, u-513, u-590, u-591, u-598, u-604 and u-662.
among the warships lost by the brazilian navy, were the minelayer bz camaqua, which capsized during a storm while escorting a convoy in july 1944, and the light cruiser bz bahia due to a gunnery accident.
the majority of the crew of the bahia were lost.
of the three brazilian military ships lost during the war, only the freighter-troopship vital de oliveira was due to the action of an enemy submarine, being sunk by the u-861 on july 20, 1944.
the brazilian 1st division of the feb was subordinate to the allied 15th army group under field marshal harold alexander (later succeeded by general mark clark), via the us fifth army of lieutenant general mark clark (later succeeded by lieutenant general lucian truscott) and the us iv corps of major general willis d. crittenberger.
the entry for the gothic line order of battle provides the layout for the allied and german armies in italy.
the feb headquarters functioned as an administrative headquarters and link to the brazilian high command under the secretary of war, general eurico gaspar dutra in rio de janeiro.
general mascarenhas de morais (later marshal) was the commander of the feb, with general zenóbio da costa as chief of the 6th regimental combat team (rct) of caçapava (the first feb rct to land in italy), and general cordeiro de farias as commander of artillery.
the feb was (theoretically) organized as a standard us infantry division of that time, complete in all aspects, down to its logistical tail (including postal and banking services), although some of these, like its health services, were found to be deficient and had to be complemented, and in many cases controlled or managed by americans.
its combat units were, besides the aforementioned 6th rct, the 1st rct based in rio de janeiro, and the 11th from são joão del rey.
each rct had about 5,000 men (corresponding in size to today brigades), divided in three then called "battalions" consisting of four companies each, including supporting units for combat, and other army branches, like artillery, engineering, and cavalry.
the brazilian air force fighter squadron was itself under the mediterranean allied tactical air force.
soon after brazil declared war on the axis, it began a popular mobilization for an expeditionary force to fight in europe.
at that time, brazil was a country with a traditionally isolationist foreign policy, with a population largely rural and illiterate, whilst having an economy focused on the export of commodities, and lacking infrastructure in industry, health and education systems that could serve as material and human support to the war effort.
in addition, an action plan that could circumvent this situation (like the calogeras plan of the previous world war) was out of the question, since many brazilian military officers did not see favorably some unavoidable internal consequences that would result in an nazi-fascist defeat in europe, such as increased demands for democratic changes by the general population.
at the time, brazil was living under a military regime, that had been openly authoritarian from 1937, and that had been sympathetic to nazi-fascist regimes until 1941. brazil was thus precluded from pursuing a line of autonomous action in the conflict, and found it difficult to take even a modest role in it.
faced with the government's passivity and unwillingness, plutocrat of the mass media, assis chateaubriand, came to negotiate with us officials stationed in brazil, for the creation of an expeditionary army division, composed of volunteers from all of latin america.
this division would be financed by him, led by a brazilian general, and trained by american officials.
this initiative was curtailed by the brazilian government in early 1943.
in addition to the above-mentioned reasons, political distrust between the brazilian and american authorities, as well as divergences regarding the brazilian expeditionary force as about its size (between brazilian aspirations and the american convenience in managing it abroad) and on whether it should be properly trained and armed before boarding, or be stationed already behind the lines at the italian front; caused almost two years to elapse before the official entrance of brazil into the war and the sending of its first troops to the european theater of operations (compared with almost one year between the usa's entrance and the operation torch).
in the end, the brazilian government gathered a force of one army division of 25,000 men (replacements included), compared with an initial declared goal of a whole army corps of 100,000, to join the allies in the italian campaign.
on july 2, 1944, the first five thousand feb soldiers, the 6th rct, left brazil for europe aboard the uss general mann, and arrived in italy on july 16. they disembarked in naples, where they waited to join the us task force 45. they had landed without weapons, and since there was no arrangement for barracks, the troops remained on the docks.
this caused controversy in the brazilian media.
in late july, two more transports with brazilian troops reached italy, with three more following in september and november 1944, and february 1945. one notable unit deployed was brazil's mountain infantry battalion.
the feb dedicated its first weeks in italy to acquiring the proper equipment to fight on italian terrain, and to training under american command.
the preparation in brazil, despite the two years' interval since the declaration of war, had proved almost worthless.
among the veterans of that campaign, there was a consensus that only combat could adequately prepare the soldier, regardless of the quality of training received earlier.
in august, the troops moved to tarquinia, 350 km north of naples, where clark's army was based.
in november, the feb joined general crittenberger's us iv corps.
the brazilians joined what was a multinational hodgepodge of forces.
the american forces included the segregated african-american 92nd infantry division and the japanese-american 442nd infantry regiment.
british empire forces included new zealanders, canadians, indians, gurkhas, black africans, jews and arabs from the british mandate in palestine, south africans and rhodesians, units of exiles—poles, greeks, czechs, slovaks, as well as anti-fascist italians, all serving under british command.
french forces included senegalese, moroccans and algerians.
the germans made much of the political aspect of the presence of the brazilian force in italy.
they targeted propaganda specifically at the brazilians.
in addition to leaflets, the germans provided an hour-long daily radio broadcast (in portuguese) from berlin radio called "hora auriverde" (goldengreen hour).
the feb achieved battlefield successes at massarosa, camaiore, mount prano, monte acuto, san quirico, gallicano, barga, monte castello, la serra, castelnuovo di vergato, soprassasso, montese, paravento, zocca, marano sul panaro, collecchio and fornovo di taro.
the first missions the brazilians undertook in close connection with the us 370th rct, were reconnaissance operations to the end of august.
brazilian troops helped to partially fill the gap left by divisions of the us vi corps and french expeditionary corps that left italy for operation dragoon, the invasion of southern france.
on september 16, the 6th rct took massarosa.
two days later it also took camaiore and other small towns on the way north.
by then, the feb had already conquered monte prano, and taken control of the serchio valley without any major casualties.
after having suffered its first reverses around barga city, and after the arrival of the 1st rct at the end of october, the feb was directed to the base of the northern apennines, on the border between tuscany and emilia-romagna regions, where it would spend the next months facing the harsh winter and the resistance of the gothic line.
allied forces were unable to break through the mountains over the winter and an offensive by german and italian divisions to the left of the feb sector, against the us 92nd infantry division, required the assistance of the 8th indian infantry division before it was repelled.
between the end of february and the beginning of march 1945, in preparation for the spring offensive, the brazilian division and the us 10th mountain division were able to capture important positions on the northern apennines (noteworthy in the brazilian sector, for monte castello and castelnuovo), which deprived the germans of key artillery positions in the mountains, whose effective fire had since the fall of 1944 blocked the allied path to bologna.
in the us fifth army's sector, the final offensive on the italian front began on april 14, after a bombardment of 2,000 artillery pieces; an attack carried out by the troops of us iv corps led by the brazilian division took montese.
after the first day of the allied offensive, the germans, without much effort, had stopped the main attack of iv corps led by the us 10th mountain division, causing significant casualties among the troops of that formation.
the germans were misled into thinking that the feb's raid over montese, using m8 armoured cars and sherman tanks, could be the real main allied objective in that sector, which led them to shell the brazilians with 1,800 artillery rounds from the total of 2,800 used against all four allied divisions in that sector during the days of the battle for montese, when they tried unsuccessfully to take montese back from the brazilians.
after that, the breaking of the germans' lines to the north by forces of iv corps became unavoidable.
on the right, the polish division, from the british 8th army, and the us 34th infantry division, from fifth army, entered bologna on 21 april.
on 25 april the italian resistance movement started a general partisan insurrection at the same time as brazilian troops arrived at parma and the americans at modena and genoa.
the british 8th army advanced towards venice and trieste.
at the battle of collecchio, brazilian forces were preparing to face fierce resistance at the taro river region from the retreating german-italian forces in the region of genoa/la spezia that had been set free by troops of the 92nd us division.
these axis troops were enveloped near fornovo and after some fighting surrendered.
on april 28, the brazilians captured more than 13,000 men, including the entire 148th infantry division, elements of the 90th panzergrenadier and the italian 1st bersaglieri "italia" division.
this took the german command by surprise as it had planned for these troops to join forces with the german-italian army of liguria to counterattack against the fifth army.
fifth army had advanced, as is inevitable in these situations, in a fast but diffuse and disarranged way uncoordinated with air support, and had left some gaps on its left flank and to the rear.
the axis forces had left many bridges intact along the po river to facilitate a counter-attack.
german army command was already negotiating a truce in caserta, and hoped that a counterattack would improve the conditions for surrender.
the events in fornovo disrupted the german plan, as much by the disarray of their troops as by the delay it caused.
this, added to the news of adolf hitler's death and the taking of berlin by the red army, left the german command in italy with no option but to accept the demand for the unconditional surrender of its troops.
in their final advance, the brazilians reached turin and then on 2 may they joined up with french troops at the border in susa.
that same day brought the announcement of the end of hostilities in italy.
the 1ogavca (1st fighter squadron/1º grupo de aviação de caça) was formed on december 18, 1943. its commanding officer was ten.-cel.-av.
(aviation lieutenant colonel) nero moura.
the squadron had 350 men, including 48 pilots.
it was divided into four flights: red ("a"), yellow ("b"), blue ("c"), and green ("d").
unlike the feb's army component, the 1ogavca had personnel who were experienced brazilian air force (portuguese: força aérea brasileira, or fab) pilots.
one of them was alberto m. torres, who commanded the pby-5a catalina that had sunk u-199 (which had been operating off the brazilian coast).
among the 48 pilots of the brazilian unit who carried out war missions, there was a total of 22 losses; five of the pilots were killed by anti-aircraft fire, eight had their planes shot down and bailed out over enemy territory, six had to give up flying operations on medical orders and three died in flying accidents.
the squadron trained for combat at u.s. bases in panama, where 2o ten.-av.
(aviation second lieutenant) dante isidoro gastaldoni was killed in a training accident.
on may 11, 1944, the squadron was declared operational and became active in the air defense of the panama canal zone.
on june 22, the 1ogavca traveled to the us to convert to the republic p-47d thunderbolt.
on september 19, 1944 the 1ogavca left for italy, arriving at livorno on october 6. since the "group" arrived at the front with the minimum limit number of pilots for an air group, and there was no prediction of replacements arrival in a forthcoming future, it was attached as a squadron at the 350th fighter group of the usaaf, which in turn was part of the 62nd fighter wing of the 12th air force, into the xxii tactical air command.
the brazilian pilots initially flew from 31 october 1944, as individual elements of flights attached to 350th fg squadrons, at first in affiliation flights and progressively taking part in more dangerous missions.
less than two weeks later, on november 11, the brazilian squadron started its own operations flying from its base at tarquinia, using its tactical callsign jambock.
brazilian air force stars replaced the white us star in the roundel on the fab thunderbolts.
the 1ogavca started its fighting career as a fighter-bomber unit, its missions being armed reconnaissance and interdiction, in support of the us fifth army, to which the feb was attached.
on april 16, 1945, the us fifth army started its offensive along the po valley.
by then, the strength of the "group" had fallen to the standard size of an air squadron: 23 pilots, since some had been killed, others shot down and captured, while others had been relieved from their duties on medical grounds due to wounds or combat fatigue.
on 22 april 1945, the three remaining flights took off at 5-minute intervals, starting at 8:30 am, to destroy bridges, barges, and motorized vehicles in the san benedetto region.
at 10:00 am, a flight took off for an armed reconnaissance mission south of mantua.
they destroyed more than 80 german military vehicles, including tanks.
by the end of the day, the brazilian squadron had flown 44 individual missions and destroyed a high number of vehicles and barges.
on this day brazilians flew the most sorties of the war; consequently, brazil commemorates april 22 as 'brazilian fighter arm' day.
the 1st brazilian fighter squadron accomplished 445 missions, with a total of 2,546 flights and 5,465 hours of flight on active service.
it destroyed 1,304 motor-vehicles, 13 railway waggons, 8 armoured cars, 25 railway and highway bridges and 31 fuel tanks and munition depots.
in all, the 1ogavca flew a total of 445 missions, 2,550 individual sorties, and 5,465 combat flight hours, from november 11, 1944 to may 6, 1945.  the xxii tactical air command acknowledged the efficiency of the brazilian squadron by noting that although it flew only 5% of the total of missions carried out by all squadrons under its control, it accomplished a much higher percentage of the total destruction wrought:
total of operations of the first brazilian fighter squadron in the italy campaign:
on april 22, 1986, the 1st fighter "group" of the brazilian air force was awarded the presidential unit citation for its actions in the po valley region of italy in world war ii.
the fighter squadron participated in several actions in support of the brazilian army division yet was not subject to its command.
in contrast, the 1st e.l.o.
(a portuguese acronym for 1st "liaison & observer flight") was directly under the command of the brazilian division.
formed in late july 1944, the 1st e.l.o.
consisted of reservist officers - air force pilots and army artillery observers, who flew together aboard piper l-4h cubs.
this air unit accompanied the brazilian division throughout its italian campaign.
while the brazilian division still worked in the post-war occupation of the provinces of piacenza, lodi and alessandria, in early june 1945 the brazilian secretary of war ordered the feb's units should stay subordinate to the commander of the first military region, based in the city of then capital rio de janeiro, which ultimately meant the dissolution of the expeditionary division, which was sent back to brazil along the second half of 1945.
the bodies of the soldiers buried in the feb cemetery in pistoia were later transferred to a mausoleum in rio de janeiro.
marshal mascarenhas de moraes had proposed and promoted the construction of the mausoleum and it was inaugurated on july 24, 1960. it covers an area of 6,850 square meters.
brazil's participation in world war ii was more extensive than its participation in the previous world war.
while the main brazilian military contribution occurred in the south atlantic campaign, sending a ground force overseas had more political and social visibility.
the brazilian division was one of about 30 allied military formations (20 divisions and 10 brigades) on the italian front at that time.
although the division played an important part in the sectors in which it operated, none of these were the main sector on that front (which was, after the german retreat to the north of rome, the east of the country near to the adriatic sea, under the responsibility of the british 8th army).
furthermore, the italian front became secondary for both sides after d-day and the invasion of southern france.
due to the brazilian regime's unwillingness to get more deeply involved in the allied war effort, by early 1943 a popular saying was: "it's more likely for a snake to smoke a pipe than for the feb to go the front and fight."
("mais fácil uma cobra fumar um cachimbo, do que a feb embarcar para o combate.").
before the feb entered combat, the expression "a cobra vai fumar" ("the snake will smoke") was often used in brazil in a context similar to "when pigs fly".
as a result, the soldiers of the feb called themselves cobras fumantes (literally, smoking snakes) and wore a divisional shoulder patch that showed a snake smoking a pipe.
it was also common for brazilian soldiers to write on their mortars, "the snake is smoking ..." ("a cobra está fumando...").
[citation needed] after the war the meaning was reversed, signifying that something will definitively happen and in a furious and aggressive way.
with that second meaning the use of the expression "a cobra vai fumar" has been retained in brazilian portuguese until the present, although few of the younger generations realize the origin of the expression.

a memorial of the korean queen heo hwang-ok is located in ayodhya, india.
heo hwang-ok is a legendary queen mentioned in the 13th-century chronicle samguk yusa.
she is said to have come to geumgwan gaya from ayuta.
based on identification of ayuta with ayodhya, she is believed to be of indian origin.
in 2001, a korean delegation, which included the north korean ambassador to india, inaugurated a memorial dedicated to her in ayodhya.
the monument was built in korean tradition using a 3 m high and 7,500 kg heavy stone shipped from korea.
in march 2016, a 38-member south korean delegation made a proposal to develop the memorial further.
the proposal was accepted by the uttar pradesh chief minister akhilesh yadav.
the regional tourism office of india released ₹ 30 million for the development of the memorial.
it was decided that south korean architects will survey the land, and prepare an action plan.
song eun-bok, the mayor of the gimhae city, had visited ayodhya in 2000 and made a similar plan, but it had not materialized.
[citation needed] in may 2017, during the indian prime minister narendra modi's visit to seoul, a decision was taken to upgrade the monument as a joint project between india and south korea.
on 6 november 2018 on the eve of deepavali celebration, south korean first lady kim jung-sook laid the foundation stone for the expansion and beautification of the existing memorial.
hundreds of south korean tourists visit ayodhya every year to pay tributes to their queen.
based on formal korean governmental approval and identification of the city of ayodhya as from where their famous legendary indian queen heo hwang-ok came, the myors of the city of "ayodhya" in india and the city of "gimhae" in south korea also signed an international "sister city" bond in march 2001 to formalise the relationship and encourage cultural and mutual development.
abraham lincoln: the man (also called standing lincoln) is a larger-than-life size 12-foot (3.7 m) bronze statue of abraham lincoln, the 16th president of the united states.
the original statue is in lincoln park in chicago, and several replicas have been installed in other places around the world.
completed by augustus saint-gaudens in 1887, it has been described as the most important sculpture of lincoln from the 19th century.
at the time, the new york evening post called it "the most important achievement american sculpture has yet produced."
abraham lincoln ii, lincoln's only grandson, was present, among a crowd of 10,000, at the unveiling.
the artist later created the abraham lincoln: the head of state ('seated lincoln') sculpture in chicago's grant park.
the sculpture depicts a contemplative lincoln rising from a chair, about to give a speech.
it is set upon a pedestal and, in chicago, an exedra designed by architect stanford white.
chicago businessman eli bates (1806–1881) provided $40,000 in his will for the statue.
saint-gaudens was specially selected for the commission after a design competition failed to produce a winning artist.
saint-gaudens, who revered the president, had seen lincoln at the time of his inauguration, and later viewed lincoln's body lying in state.
for his design, the artist also relied on a life mask and hand casts made of lincoln in 1860 by leonard w. volk.
while planning and working on the standing lincoln, saint-gaudens was first enticed to what would become his home and studio, and an associated artist's colony.
to convince him to vacation near cornish, new hampshire, a friend told him the area had "many lincoln-shaped men".
the sculpture's naturalism influenced a generation of artists.
the monument was also a favorite of hull house founder jane addams, who once wrote, "i walked the wearisome way from hull-house to lincoln park ... in order to look at and gain magnanimous counsel from the statue."
journalist andrew ferguson discusses the statue at length in his book land of lincoln, writing that the statue presents "a sort of world-weariness that seems almost kind".
the city of chicago awarded the monument landmark status on december 12, 2001. it is located near the chicago history museum and north avenue.
replicas of the statue stand at lincoln tomb in springfield, illinois, parque lincoln in mexico city, and parliament square in london.
the parliament square statue was given to britain in july 1920. the american ambassador made a formal presentation at central hall, westminster, where prime minister david lloyd george accepted the gift on behalf of the people of britain; after a procession to parliament square, the statue was unveiled by prince arthur, duke of connaught.
the mexico city statue was presented by united states president lyndon johnson to the people of mexico in 1964.  later, johnson received a small copy of the bust from the statue, which since then is often seen displayed in the oval office of the white house.
in 2016, a newly cast replica of the full-height statue was installed in the garden at saint-gaudens national historic site in cornish.
from 1910 onwards, saint-gaudens' widow, augusta, oversaw the casting of a number of smaller replicas of the statue, reduced to slightly under one-third the size of the original.

the morgan morgan monument, also known as morgan park, is a 1.05-acre (0.4 ha) roadside park in the unincorporated town of bunker hill in berkeley county, west virginia.
it is located along winchester avenue (u.s. route 11) and mill creek.
the park features a granite monument that was erected in 1924 to memorialize morgan morgan (1688–1766), an american pioneer of welsh descent, who was among the earliest european persons to settle permanently within the present-day boundaries of west virginia.
the west virginia legislature appropriated funds for the construction of the morgan morgan monument in 1923. west virginia governor and morgan descendant ephraim f. morgan appointed and oversaw a committee of three people to plan and supervise the monument's construction: haze morgan, another morgan descendant and the commission's chairperson; blanche m. pickering (mrs. a. a. pickering) of rowlesburg; and west virginia state senator harry p. henshaw of bunker hill.
a dedication and unveiling ceremony was held for the monument on september 13, 1924, and governor morgan served as the principal speaker.
initially owned by the west virginia monuments commission following the monument's establishment in 1924, the morgan morgan monument was transferred to the west virginia road commission, which maintained it as a roadside park from 1924 to 1956. from 1956 to 1970, the park was managed by the west virginia conservation commission's division of state parks as a west virginia state park.
it was the only west virginia state park ever to have been located within berkeley county.
the west virginia road commission (now known as the west virginia division of highways) resumed its operation of the morgan morgan monument in 1970, and the division continues to maintain the monument as a roadside park.
in 1980 the morgan morgan monument and its park were included as a contributing property in the mill creek historic district on the national register of historic places.
the morgan morgan monument, also known as morgan park, consists of a 1.05-acre (0.4 ha) park, the 1924 granite monument to morgan morgan, and two west virginia highway markers immediately south of the monument.
one highway marker features a brief biography of morgan morgan, and the other describes morgan acres, the possible location of the first structure built by morgan as a crude shelter.
the monument is situated within the unincorporated town of bunker hill in berkeley county, west virginia.
the monument's park is bound to its west by winchester avenue (u.s. route 11) and the route's bridge over mill creek, to its north by a filling station parking lot, to its east by a gravel parking area, and to its south by mill creek, which flows from west to east into opequon creek.
several springs lie to the south of the monument along the southern edge of mill creek.
the morgan morgan monument is located 9.6 miles (15 km) southwest of martinsburg and 11.9 miles (19 km) northeast of winchester, virginia; it is 3,256 feet (992 m) east of the inwood quarry.
the morgan morgan monument lies within the mill creek historic district near several morgan family properties in the bunker hill and gerrardstown areas listed on the national register of historic places (nrhp).
it is situated 1,279 feet (390 m) to the northeast of the interment sites of morgan morgan and the morgan family at the morgan chapel and graveyard on runnymeade road (west virginia secondary route 26).
morgan's son david built a structure that became part of the morgan-gold house, which is 1.3 miles (2 km) west of the monument.
the william g. morgan house (site of morgan acres and morgan's first crude shelter) is 2.4 miles (4 km) west of the monument.
cool spring farm, the home of morgan's son zackquill morgan and the site of morgan cabin, is located 2.7 miles (4 km) to the west of the monument.
the monument memorializes morgan morgan (1688–1766), an american pioneer of welsh descent who was among the earliest europeans to settle permanently within the boundaries of the present-day u.s. state of west virginia.
the mill creek watershed and the land upon which the morgan morgan monument is located were originally part of the northern neck proprietary, a land grant that the exiled charles ii, king of england, awarded to seven of his supporters in 1649 during the english interregnum.
following the restoration in 1660, charles ii finally ascended to the english throne.
charles ii renewed the northern neck proprietary grant in 1662, revised it in 1669, and again renewed the original grant favoring original grantee thomas colepeper, 2nd baron colepeper, and henry bennet, 1st earl of arlington, in 1672. in 1681 bennet sold his share to lord colepeper, who received a new charter for the entire land grant from james ii, king of england, in 1688. following the deaths of lord colepeper, his wife margaret, and his daughter katherine, the northern neck proprietary passed to katherine's son thomas fairfax, 6th lord fairfax of cameron, in 1719.
morgan morgan arrived in the bunker hill area circa 1731 when it was still a part of spotsylvania county, and he was given a 1,000-acre (405 ha) land grant of the northern neck proprietary's land on december 12, 1735. morgan was believed to have been the first european to permanently settle in present-day west virginia; however, german settlers may have inhabited shepherdstown as early as 1727. morgan became active in local governance, and was appointed a justice of the peace for spotsylvania county by the virginia governor's council on april 23, 1734. orange county was created from spotsylvania in late 1734, and morgan continued on as a justice of the peace for the new county.
in january 1735 when the orange county court first convened, morgan served on its new commission of the peace.
morgan also served as captain of the orange county militia.
he worked to develop the region's road network and infrastructure, and is credited with developing and overseeing the construction of a route between bunker hill and winchester.
morgan also operated an ordinary on his property.
morgan was instrumental in helping to create frederick county from orange county in 1738. morgan served as a justice of the peace on the frederick county court's commission of the peace when it was convened in 1743. morgan also served as a vestryman of the frederick parish of the anglican church.
around 1740 he established present-day west virginia's first anglican communion church along with settlers john briscoe and jacob hite.
the church was originally built as a log structure known as morgan's chapel, and after its reconstruction in 1851, it became known as christ episcopal church.
morgan morgan and his family are interred in the church's adjoining cemetery.
after morgan's death, berkeley county was created in 1772 from the northern third of frederickcounty.
morgan's original log cabin was constructed between 1731 and 1734. this structure was rebuilt and restored with many of its original logs in 1976 as a west virginia and berkeley county bicentennial project.
wood siding was added to the cabin's exterior in 1994 to protect the original logs.
known as the morgan cabin, it is located on the cool spring farm property 2.74 miles (4 km) west of the monument and bunker hill.
morgan cabin, cool spring farm, and the surrounding 104 acres (42 ha) are owned by the berkeley county historical landmarks association and managed by a special committee of the association.
during its 1923 legislative session, the west virginia legislature passed a bill (introduced by west virginia state senator harry p. henshaw of bunker hill) appropriating $5,000 toward a monument memorializing morgan morgan in bunker hill.
the bill was approved by west virginia governor ephraim f. morgan, a direct descendant of morgan.
the bill stated that morgan morgan was "a man of high character who, by his efforts and example, was largely useful in the community of which he was the founder".
it also proclaimed that the monument to morgan would "commemorate his life and deeds".
half of the bill's appropriation was disbursed in 1924, and the other half was disbursed later in 1925. the monument was to be located at or near morgan's burial site at morgan chapel.
the bill stipulated that the monument would be planned and supervised by the morgan morgan monument commission, which was to consist of three members appointed by the governor, who was to oversee the commission.
on the morning of january 2, 1924, governor morgan appointed the committee, which consisted of haze morgan, another direct descendant of morgan and the commission's chairperson; blanche m. pickering (mrs. a. a. pickering) of rowlesburg; and west virginia state senator harry p. henshaw of bunker hill.
the commission purchased a 1.05-acre (0.4 ha) lot for $420 for the construction of the monument in bunker hill.
the granite morgan morgan monument was erected in 1924. it was unveiled and dedicated during a ceremony held on september 13, 1924, and arranged by the colonel morgan morgan chapter of the daughters of the american revolution (dar) of clarksburg, two local dar chapters, and several virginia dar chapters.
governor morgan, who appointed and oversaw the monument's commission, was the principal speaker at the ceremony and delivered its chief address.
governor morgan also accepted the monument on behalf of the state of west virginia.
charles james faulkner, former united states senator from west virginia, gave a speech about morgan and the early history of berkeley county.
the local students of bunker hill formed a chorus to perform at the ceremony.
the actual unveiling of the monument was performed by morgan descendant anna mildred morgan of the colonel morgan morgan chapter of the dar.
a benediction was given by morgan chapel rector rev.
j. l. oldham.
the colonel morgan morgan chapter of the dar planted a tree near the monument at the conclusion of the dedication program.
in addition to the colonel morgan morgan chapter of the dar, organizers of the dedication ceremony included morgan morgan monument commission chairman haze morgan and members blanche m. pickering and harry p. henshaw.
several hundred attendees were present at the dedication ceremony, mostly from the immediate area, clarksburg, fairmont, and nearby communities in virginia.
also held in connection with the dedication was a family reunion of morgan morgan's descendants.
later in 1924, the west virginia monuments commission transferred the monument site to the west virginia road commission because the monuments commission felt the road commission was better suited to maintain the monument due to its equipment.
following its transfer to the road commission, the park added a tourist camp and became the first free public tourist attraction in the state of west virginia.
the roadside park was occasionally utilized by local organizations for the hosting of events, including by the rest church of nearby rest, virginia.
in 1925 the legislature established the state forest, park and conservation commission to study and investigate the opportunities and needs for forests, parks, game preserves, and recreational areas in west virginia.
in 1927 the commission provided its recommendations to the legislature, which included a recommendation for a state monument system.
in its list of extant historical monuments to be included in this system, the commission named the grave creek mound in moundsville, the point pleasant monument (now tu-endie-wei) in point pleasant, the james rumsey monument in nearby shepherdstown, the cadell rifle range in preston county, and the morgan morgan monument.
in 1956 the morgan morgan monument and roadside park was transferred to the ownership of the west virginia conservation commission's division of state parks, thus making it a part of the west virginia state parks system.
it was the only state park ever to have been operated in berkeley county.
the monument and its adjoining park were under the jurisdiction of cacapon resort state park in nearby omps.
its maintenance was the responsibility of cacapon resort state park's supervisor james ambrose and his subordinate personnel.
in 1960 the morgan morgan monument was listed in a national park service (nps) tabulation of u.s. state parks and was categorized as a "state monument" under the governance of the west virginia conservation commission's division of state parks.
the nps noted that the small park lacked water recreation, overnight accommodations, and eating accommodations.
in 1962 the monument was included as a stop on the annual house and garden tour of shepherdstown, martinsburg, charles town, and harpers ferry, which was sponsored by the shenandoah–potomac garden council.
between july 1, 1963, and june 30, 1964, the west virginia conservation commission's division of state parks recorded the attendance of 1,500 visitors to the morgan morgan monument, the lowest figure in the state park system.
a 1964 nps survey of west virginia state park facilities noted that the morgan morgan monument was a "day and weekend use" park whose only significant feature was its historical relevance.
in 1966 the west virginia historic commission erected two west virginia highway markers within the park to the immediate south of the monument: one with a brief biography of morgan and the other detailing nearby morgan acres.
in early 1970 the ownership and operation of the monument and park were transferred to the west virginia state road commission, which later became known as the west virginia division of highways under the west virginia department of transportation.
the morgan morgan monument became a contributing property of the mill creek historic district on the nrhp on december 10, 1980. as of 2016, the park is erroneously listed in the west virginia blue book as bunker hill state park.
the blue book is an annual guide published by the west virginia legislature.
the morgan morgan monument consists of a tall granite stone from barre, vermont, atop a concrete foundation.
the monument measures 12.5 feet (4 m) in total height.
a 10-inch (25 cm) medallion of the seal of west virginia is affixed to the top of the monument's main (western) façade, over two indented lines within the stone.
the following inscription is etched into the stone below the seal: "col. morgan morgan nov. 1, 1688 – nov. 17, 1766".
below the inscription is a plaque that reads:
erected by the state of west virginia
in commemoration of the first settlement within the present boundaries of said state, which was made by col. morgan morgan, a native of wales, and catherine garretson, his wife, in the year 1726 on a tract of 1000 acres about 2 miles west of here.
granted to him by colonial virginia patent, and in recognition of the sterling character of the said morgan and family who by their efforts and example, were largely useful in the community of which he was the founder and had great influence for good upon the early history of the territory now constituting this state.
his grave (marked) is nearby, adjacent christ's episcopal church formerly called morgan's chapel, the oldest church in this state, which he helped organize and build.

agustina del carmen otero iglesias (4 november 1868 – 10 april 1965), better known as carolina otero or la belle otero, was a spanish actress, dancer and courtesan.
she had a reputation for great beauty and was famous for her numerous lovers.
agustina del carmen otero iglesias was born in valga (pontevedra), galicia, spain, daughter of a spanish single mother, carmen otero iglesias (1844–1903), and a greek army officer, named carasson.
her family was impoverished, and as a child she moved to santiago de compostela working as a maid.
at ten she was raped, and at fourteen she left home with her boyfriend and dancing partner, paco, and began working as a singer/dancer in lisbon.
in 1888 otero found a sponsor in barcelona who moved with her to marseilles in order to promote her dancing career in france.
she soon left him and created the character of la belle otero, fancying herself an andalusian gypsy.
she was pretty, confident, intelligent, with an attractive figure.
it was once said of her that her extraordinarily dark black eyes were so captivating that they were "of such intensity that it was impossible not to be detained before them".
she wound up as the star of folies bèrgere productions in paris.
one of her most famous costumes featured her voluptuous bosom partially covered with glued-on precious gems, and the twin cupolas of the carlton hotel built in 1912 in cannes are popularly said to have been modeled upon her breasts.
within a short number of years, otero grew to be the most sought after woman in all of europe.
she was serving, by this time, as a courtesan to wealthy and powerful men of the day, and she chose her lovers carefully.
she associated herself with the likes of kaiser wilhelm ii, prince albert i of monaco, king edward vii, kings of serbia, and kings of spain as well as russian grand dukes peter and nicholas, the duke of westminster and writer gabriele d'annunzio.
her love affairs made her infamous, and the envy of many other notable female personalities of the day.
six men reportedly committed suicide after their love affairs with otero ended, although this has never been substantiated beyond a doubt.
it is a fact, however, that two men did fight a duel over her.
in august 1898, in st-petersburg, the french film operator félix mesguich (an employee of the lumière company) shot a one-minute reel of otero performing the famous "valse brillante."
the screening of the film at the aquarium music-hall provoked such a scandal (because an officer of the tsar's army appeared in this frivolous scene) that mesguich was expelled from russia.
otero retired after world war i, purchasing a mansion and property at a cost of the equivalent of us$15 million.
she had accumulated a massive fortune over the years, about us$25 million, but she gambled much of it away over the remainder of her lifetime, enjoying a lavish lifestyle, and visiting the casinos of monte carlo often.
she lived out her life in a more and more pronounced state of poverty until she died of a heart attack in 1965 in her one-room apartment at the hotel novelty in nice, france.
of her heyday and career, otero once said, "women have one mission in life: to be beautiful.
when one gets old, one must learn how to break mirrors.
i am very gently expecting to die."

innocent victims is a bronze statue of diana, princess of wales and dodi fayed, which has been on display at the harrods department store in london, england, since 2005. it was commissioned by dodi's father mohamed al-fayed when he owned harrods, and designed by william mitchell.
the statue is the second of two memorials in harrods to diana, princess of wales and dodi fayed, both commissioned by mohamed al-fayed, dodi's father, who owned the store from 1985 to 2010. the first memorial, unveiled in april 1998, is a pyramid-shaped display containing photos of dodi and diana, a wine glass said to be from their last dinner, and a ring said to have been purchased by dodi the day prior to the crash in which they both died.
the statue was designed by london-born sculptor william mitchell and cast in bronze using the lost wax method at the bronze age foundry in east london.
it depicts diana and dodi facing each other, clad in loose clothing that clings to their bodies.
they are said to be dancing in mediterranean waves.
dodi's right arm is raised and appears to be releasing a large bird, said to be an albatross symbolising "freedom and eternity".
diana's left arm is also raised, gripping dodi's hand.
their other arms are below their waists, the fingers just touching.
there is a forward momentum in their poses, diana's right leg bent and exposed by a dress cut to the top of her thigh.
dodi's right leg is completely off the base of the statue.
both are bare-footed.
the inner curve of the wings of the bird has been described as forming a double d.
mitchell also designed the egyptian escalator at harrods and the associated carvings which form the background to both of the dodi and diana monuments.
at the time of its unveiling in september 2005, al-fayed said:
as we approach the eighth anniversary of diana and dodi's untimely death and in the absence of any further official memorial for these two victims – apart from the highly criticised fountain in hyde park – i wanted to keep their spirits alive with a further gesture ... i have named the sculpture innocent victims because for eight years i have fought to prove that my son and princess diana were murdered.
in january 2018, it was announced that the statue would be returned to the al-fayed family, seven years after mohamed al-fayed sold harrods to the qatar investment authority.
at the time of the unveiling, al-fayed had said that the statue would stay at harrods forever.
the qatari owners are eager to regain the patronage of the british royal family, and that this would have financial benefits, harrods having been royal warrant holders continuously from 1913 to 2000 until "the ugly aftermath" of the death of diana and dodi.
the statue and memorial had attracted thousands of tourists.

the maitland monument, also known as the maitland rotunda or the peristyle of maitland (greek: περιστύλιο του μαίτλαντ), is a neoclassical monument located at the end of spianada square in corfu.
it was built in 1821 to honour sir thomas maitland, a british military officer who was the last civil commissioner and first lord high commissioner of the ionian islands.
maitland arrived in corfu on 16 february 1816, and eight months later, on 25 october 1816, forty-six noble corfiots made a proposal for the construction of a triumphal arch in his honour.
the monument was eventually constructed in 1821 in a completely different form of a rotunda with twenty ionic columns.
it was designed by colonel george whitmore of the royal engineers.
like the palace of st. michael and st. george, the structure was built out of limestone imported from malta, which was a british colony at the time.
maitland had simultaneously held the positions of lord high commissioner of the ionian islands and governor of malta.
the sculptural work was done by the local sculptor pavlos prosalentis.
the monument is also known as the cistern (greek: στέρνα), since it is built on top of a venetian-era underground water cistern which had been built in 1781. the two entrances of the monument allowed access to the water tank.
the top of the monument contains the following circular inscription:
the maitland monument is visible in the 1981 bond film for your eyes only.
the monument was damaged due to erosion over the years, and it was restored in 2004.

palashi monument is a monument in palashi (plassey), nadia district, in the state of west bengal.
this was erected in memory of the battle of plassey fought between sir robert clive, commander of the british east india company and nawab siraj ud-daulah on 23 june 1757. the monument is under preservation of archaeological survey of india.
in 2007, on the 250th anniversary of the battle, a statue of siraj ud-daulah was established by all india forward bloc leader debabrata biswas (politician) on behalf of india-pakistan-bangladesh people's forum.
the monument was established in the bank of the bhagirathi river and beside plassey suger mill which is popularly known as plassey battlefield.
but the actual battlefield has been partially washed away by a shift of the river.
the place is located from almost 150 km.
from kolkata and 7 km from the plassey railway station.
an equestrian statue of tadeusz kościuszko by the italian and american artist gaetano trentanove is located on the south side of milwaukee, wisconsin, in the united states.
the bronze equestrian sculpture portrays kościuszko in his military uniform and hat.
it is located at south 9th place and west lincoln avenue in kosciuszko park.
the statue was placed in october 1904 but was not officially unveiled until june 18, 1905 with a speech by archbishop f. symon from rome.
the statue was moved to its present location in 1951 and a celebratory unveiling was held on september 15 of that year.
a condition assessment of the monument was conducted by mckay lodge conservation laboratory.
they found several condition issues some originating from the poor quality of the original cast and others due to climate.
the condition problems included casting porosity, patches and plugs, chill cracks, weaknesses in armature, and a general need for cleaning.
in 2013 the restore kosciuszko monument project successfully raised funds to fully restore the monument.
the statue was rededicated on november 11, 2013.

the pioneer woman statue is a work created by sculptor leo friedlander.
it is located at the texas woman's university (twu) in denton, texas, united states, and was commissioned as part of the texas centenary celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of texas independence from mexico.
the sculpture was added to the national register of historic places in 2018.
on june 3, 1935, the board of regents at twu passed a resolution stating that it urged "the centennial commission of control to allocate the sum of $30,000 for the erection of a statue to the pioneer women of texas to be erected on the campus as a part of the centennial celebration.
the idea for this statue originated with this institution, and  .
.
.
.
.
.
the erection of this statue on the campus will serve the women of the entire state, and will inspire their daughters to continued reference for the heroism and sacrifice of the pioneer women of the past who helped to make the texas of the present."
university president l.h.
hubbard, proposed the a statue to the centennial commission who agreed and responded by announcing an open  competition for sculptors to design the statue.
however "the design of the statue, including the choice of the sculptor, the design, etc, were to be handled under the direction of the state board of control, and that the college had nothing whatever to do with the matter."
the board at that time had to be satisfied with recommending a site on campus where the statue would be placed.
in june 1936, the twu board of regents passed a motion requesting that the texas centennial commission "erect a memorial chapel to pioneer women on the campus instead of the statue as proposed at the present time."
had either the regents or the members of the centennial commission known what lay ahead they might well have agreed to this request, and as it turned out, the university did eventually get its chapel, the little chapel in the woods, designed by architect o'neil ford.
first lady eleanor roosevelt spoke at its dedication in 1939.
by october 1936, plans for the statue were moving forward by "inviting a group of leading american sculptors, about 80 in number, to submit photographs of their work and from this group several sculptors are to be chosen who will be required to submit models of the proposed statue to the centennial commission of control and if the first model submitted is not acceptable other models will be submitted until an accepted group is submitted."
foreshadowing if ever there was.
among the artists who entered the competition was the texas sculptor waldine tauch, who entered seven different competitions conducted by the commission.
she was to win three of them (memorials to moses austin, isaac and frances van zandt and first shot fired for texas independence monument) but she was not able to garner the pioneer woman statue.
however, she was to play a part in the ensuing drama.
it is not yet clear how many plaster models were submitted, but a "jury of professionals" unanimously chose the one submitted by william zorach, a sculptor from new york, which included not just a pioneer woman, or a woman and child as did tauch's model, but the entire family: mother, father, son and daughter.
and they were all nude.
nudity was seen, by some, as being appropriate for classical, allegorical or symbolical portrayals  but was unacceptable for texas pioneer women.
upon learning of the commission's decision, tauch "wasted no time telephoning and writing letters to many friends throughout the state to report the incident.
""anguished protests from texans swelled into a controversy dwarfing all previous ones (in zorach's career).
one astute observer noted the woman had no wedding ring ....  while a chapter of the daughters of the republic of texas declared it, 'the greatest insult that could be offered to these women who believed and practiced the virtue of modesty' ."
zorach wrote "the newspapers said that if a texas pioneer had gone around in such a state of nudity he would have been strung to the nearest tree.
... gutzon borglum was down there at the time and i was told that he said my figures looked like a bunch of apes," a remark that was widely quoted by opponents of the statue at the time.
richard foster howard, then director of the dallas museum of art, defended zorach  and the sculptor went so far as to revise his model so that the figures were clothed, but the damage had been done.
it did not take long for the public outcry to induce the commission to reverse its decision, to declare that there was no winner of the competition.
"the commission was given quietly and without publicity to leo friedlander, a sculptor who had not ever entered the competition."
the statue was modeled, and then following its approval by the various committees in texas, carved by the piccirilli brothers in new york city.
at some point in the carving process, someone, either friedlander or the piccirilli carvers, became concerned that the statue's right hand and her right thumb and forefinger might be too weak to be self-supporting, so a small block of marble was left to add strength.
often such aids are removed in the work's final carving; they were not in this case.
for the base of the statue, the dean of women, jessie h. humphries, composed the following inscription:
"marking a trail in a pathless wilderness pressing forward with unswerving courage she met each untried situation with a resourcefulness equal to the need.
with a glad heart she brought to her frontier family her homelands cultural heritage.
with delicate spiritual sensitiveness she illuminated the dullness of routine and the loneliness of isolation with beauty and with life abundant and with all she lived with casual unawareness of her value to civilization.
such was the pioneer woman.
the unsung saint of the nations immortals."
on another side of the base the carvers included leo friedlander's name.
years later, zorach's statue, still without clothes, was cast in bronze and obtained by a colorado bank.
it was "discovered" in a courtyard of the bank's branch in pueblo, colorado.
later it was moved to denver and now (2010) resides in front of the colorado springs fine arts center.

madison square is a public square formed by the intersection of fifth avenue and broadway at 23rd street in the new york city borough of manhattan.
the square was named for james madison, fourth president of the united states.
the focus of the square is madison square park, a 6.2-acre (2.5-hectare) public park, which is bounded on the east by madison avenue (which starts at the park's southeast corner at 23rd street); on the south by 23rd street; on the north by 26th street; and on the west by fifth avenue and broadway as they cross.
the park and the square are at the northern (uptown) end of the flatiron district neighborhood of manhattan.
the neighborhood to the north and west of the park is nomad ("north of madison square park") and to the north and east is rose hill.
madison square is probably best known around the world for providing the name of madison square garden, a sports arena and its successor which were located just northeast of the park for 47 years, until 1925. the current madison square garden, the fourth such building, is not in the area.
notable buildings around madison square include the flatiron building, the toy center, the new york life building, the new york merchandise mart, the appellate division courthouse, the met life tower, and one madison park, a 50-story condominium tower.
the area where madison square is now had been a swampy hunting ground crossed by cedar creek – which was later renamed madison creek – from east to west, and first came into use as a public space in 1686.  it was a potter's field in the 1700s.
in 1807, "the parade", a tract of about 240 acres (97.12 hectares) from 23rd to 34th streets and third to seventh avenues, was set aside for use as an arsenal, a barracks, and a drilling area.
there was a united states army arsenal there from 1811 until 1825 when it became the new york house of refuge for the society for the protection of juvenile delinquents, for children under sixteen committed by the courts for indefinite periods.
in 1839 the building was destroyed by fire.
the size of the tract was reduced in 1814 to 90 acres (36.42 hectares), and it received its current name.
in 1839, a farmhouse located at what is now fifth avenue and 23rd street was turned into a roadhouse under the direction of william "corporal" thompson (1807–1872), who later renamed it "madison cottage", after the former president.
the roadhouse was the last stop for people traveling northward out of the city, or the first stop for those arriving from the north; visitors were encouraged not to sleep more than five to a bed.
though madison cottage itself was razed in 1852, but it ultimately gave rise to the names for the adjacent avenue (madison avenue) and park, which are therefore only indirectly named after president james madison.
the roots of the new york knickerbocker base ball club, one of the first professional baseball teams, are in madison square.
amateur players began in 1842 to use a vacant sandlot at 27th and madison for their games and, eventually, alexander cartwright suggested they draw up rules for the game and start a professional club.
when they lost their sandlot to development, they moved across the hudson river to hoboken, new jersey, where they played their first game in 1846.
on may 10, 1847, the 6.2-acre (2.5 ha) madison square park, named after president james madison, opened to the public.
within a few years, the tide of residential development, which was relentlessly moving uptown, had reached the madison square area.
initially, the houses around the park were narrow, crowded and dark brownstone rowhouses with small rooms easily subject to becoming cluttered.
today, the only remnant of these brownstones is a single building at 14 east 23rd street.
despite this beginning, through the 1870s, the neighborhood became an aristocratic one of brownstone row houses and mansions where the elite of the city lived; theodore roosevelt, edith wharton and winston churchill's mother, jennie jerome, were all born here.
madison cottage was torn down in 1852 to make way for franconi's hippodrome, which lasted only for two years.
it was an arena which seated 10,000 customers, and presented chariot races on its 40-foot (12 m) wide track, as well as exotic animals such as elephants and camels.
a money-loser, it would be razed so that the fifth avenue hotel could be built on the site.
in 1853, plans had been made to build the crystal palace there, but strong public opposition and protests caused the palace to be relocated by the board of aldermen to the site of present-day bryant park.
during the 1863 new york city draft riots, 10,000 federal troops brought in to control the rioters encamped in madison square and washington square, as well as stuyvesant square.
madison square was also the site in november 1864 of a political rally, complete with torchlight parade and fireworks, in support of the presidential candidacy of democrat general george b. mcclellan, who was running against his old boss, abraham lincoln.
it was larger than the republican parade the night before, which had marched from madison square to union square to rally there.
the fifth avenue hotel, a luxury hotel built by developer amos eno, and initially known as "eno's folly" because it was so far away from the hotel district, stood on the west side of madison square from 1859 to 1908. it was the first hotel in the nation with elevators, which were steam powered and known as the "vertical railroad", which had the effect of making the upper floors more desirable as they no longer had to be reached by climbing stairs.
it had fireplaces in every bedroom, private bathrooms, and public rooms which saw many elegant events.
notable visitors to the hotel included mark twain, swedish singer jenny lind, railroad tycoon jay gould, financier "big jim" fisk, the prince of wales and u.s. presidents james buchanan, abraham lincoln, andrew johnson, ulysses s. grant, rutherford b. hayes, james a. garfield, chester a. arthur, grover cleveland, benjamin harrison and william mckinley.
theodore roosevelt's campaign headquarters for his unsuccessful campaign for mayor in 1886, and his likewise failed campaign for governor in 1898 were located in the hotel.
the hotel, which was noted for its "amen corner" where republican political boss thomas collier platt held court in the 1890s, was closed and demolished in 1908.  it is reported that patrons of the hotel's bar spent $7.000 on drinks on its last day of operation.
a plaque on the toy center, the building currently on the site, commemorates the hotel.
with the success of the fifth avenue hotel, which could house 800 guests, other grand hotels such as the hoffman house, the brunswick and the victoria, opened in the surrounding area, as did entertainment venues such as the madison square theatre and chickering hall.
upscale restaurants such a delmonico's and high-end retail shops opened up along fifth avenue and broadway, in addition, nearby exclusive private clubs such as the union, athenaeum and lotos clubs, began to open.
but also, "concert-saloons", like "the luovre", full of waitresses in provocative short skirts who served drinks and provided music-hall entertainment for the customers, began to appear as well; the waitresses were often willing to take the male customers upstairs to private rooms, or to one of the many nearby brothels which had also started to pop up.
with the center of the expanding city moving north by the turn of the century, and the neighborhood becoming commercialized, elite residents moved farther uptown, away from madison square, enabling more restaurants, theatres and clubs to open up in the neighborhood, creating an entertainment district, albeit an upscale one where society balls and banquets were held in restaurants such as delmonico's.
nearby, huge dry-goods emporia such as siegel-cooper in the ladies' mile district brought daytime crowds of shoppers.
no longer primarily residential, madison square was still a thriving area.
at the western side of madison square park, on an island bordered by broadway, fifth avenue, and 25th street, stands an obelisk, designed by james goodwin batterson which was erected in 1857 over the tomb of general william jenkins worth, who served in the seminole wars and the mexican war, and for whom fort worth, texas was named, as well as worth street in lower manhattan.
the city's parks department designated the area immediately around the monument as a parklet called general worth square.
madison square park lost some acreage in 1870 when the west side was reduced so that broadway could be widened and parking provided for hansom cabs, but it was also re-landscaped by william grant and ignatz pilat, a former assistant to frederick law olmsted.
the current park maintains their overall design.
the new design brought in the sculptures that now reside in the park.
one notable sculpture is the seated bronze portrait of secretary of state william h. seward, by randolph rogers (1876), which sits at the southwest entrance to the park.
seward, who is best remembered for purchasing alaska ("seward's folly") from russia, was the first new yorker to have a monument erected in his honor.
other statues in the park depict roscoe conkling, who served in congress in both the house and the senate, and who collapsed at that spot in the park while walking home from his office during the blizzard of 1888 and died five weeks later, after refusing to pay a cab $50 for the ride; chester alan arthur, the 21st president of the united states; and david farragut, who is supposed to have said "damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead" in the battle of mobile bay during the civil war.
the farragut memorial (1881), which was first erected at fifth avenue and 26th street and moved to the square's northern end in 1935, was designed by augustus saint-gaudens (sculpture) and architect stanford white (base).
along the south edge of the park of is the eternal light flagstaff, dedicated on armistice day 1923 and restored in 2002, which commemorates the return of american soldiers and sailors from world war i.
another park highlight is the granite southern fountain, a modern reproduction of the original fountain, which was first located on the site of the old post office.
it was completed in 1843, before being rededicated in the park in 1867.  the modern replacement was installed in 1990, and renovated in 2015.
madison square continued to be a focus of public activities for the city.
in the 1870s, developer amos eno's cumberland apartment building, which stood on 22nd street where the flatiron building would eventually be built, had four-stories of its back wall facing madison square, so eno rented it out to advertisers, including the new york times, who installed a sign made up of electric lights.
eno later put a canvas screen on the wall, and projected images on it from a magic lantern on top of one of his smaller buildings on the lot, presenting both advertisements and interesting pictures in alternation.
both the times and the new york tribune began using the screen for news bulletins, and on election nights crowds of tens of thousands of people would gather in madison square, waiting for the latest results.
in 1876, a large celebration was held in madison square park to honor the centennial of the signing of the declaration of independence.
then, from 1876 to 1882, the torch and arm of the statue of liberty were exhibited in the park in an effort to raise funds for building the pedestal of the statue.
madison square was the site of some of the first electric street lighting in the city.
in 1879, the city authorized the brush electric light company to build a generating station at 25th street, powered by steam, that provided electricity for a series of arc lights which were installed on broadway between union square (at 14th street) and madison square.
the lights were illuminated on december 20, 1880. a year later, 160-foot (49 m) "sun towers" with clusters of arc lights were erected in union and madison squares.
the area around madison square continued to be commercially fashionable, if not residentially.
in 1883, art dealer thomas kirby and two others established a salon "for the encouragement and promotion of american art" on the south side of the square.
their american art association auction rooms, the first auction house in the us, quickly became the place to go in new york to buy and sell jewelry, antiquities, fine art and rare books.
the building that became the first madison square garden at 26th street and madison avenue was built in 1832 as the passenger depot of the new york and harlem rail road, and was later used by the new york and new haven railroad as well; both were owned by cornelius vanderbilt.
when the depot moved uptown in 1871 to grand central depot, the building stood vacant until 1873, when it was leased to p.t.
barnum who converted it into the open-air "monster classical and geological hippodrome" for circus performances, exhibits transferred from barnum's american museum, as well as cowboys and "indians", tattooed men, bicycle races, dog shows, and horse shows.
in 1875 the garden was sub-let to the noted band leader patrick sarsfield gilmore, who filled the space with trees, flowers and fountains and named it "gilmore's concert garden".
gilmore's band of 100 musicians played 150 consecutive concerts there, and continued to perform in the garden for two years.
after he gave up his sub-let, others presented marathon races, temperance and revival meetings, balls, the first westminster kennel club dog show (1877), as well as boxing "exhibitions" or "illustrated lectures", since competitive boxing matches were illegal at the time.
it was finally renamed "madison square garden" in 1879 by william kissam vanderbilt, the son of commodore vanderbilt, who continued to present sporting events, the national horse show, and more boxing, including bouts by john l. sullivan that drew huge crowds.
vanderbilt eventually sold what harper's weekly called his "patched-up grimy, drafty combustible, old shell" to a syndicate that included j. p. morgan, andrew carnegie, james stillman and w. w. astor.
the building that replaced it was a beaux-arts structure designed by the noted architect stanford white.
white kept an apartment in the building, and was shot dead in the garden's rooftop restaurant by millionaire harry k. thaw over an affair white had with thaw's wife, the well-known actress evelyn nesbit, who white seduced when she was 16.  the resulting sensational press coverage of the scandal caused thaw's trial to be one of the first trials of the century.
madison square became known as "diana's little wooded park" after the huge bronze statue of the roman goddess diana by augustus saint-gaudens that stood atop the 32-story tower of white's arena; at the time it was the second-tallest building in the city.
the garden hosted the annual french ball, both the barnum and the ringling brothers circuses, orchestral performances, light operas and romantic comedies, and the 1924 democratic national convention, which nominated john w. davis after 103 ballots, but it was never a financial success.
it was torn down soon after, and the venue moved uptown.
today, the arena retains its name, even though it is no longer located in the area of madison square.
to celebrate the centennial of george washington's first inauguration, in 1889 two temporary arches were erected over fifth avenue and 23rd and 26th streets.
just ten years later, in 1899, the dewey arch was built over fifth avenue and 24th street at madison square for the parade in honor of admiral george dewey, celebrating his victory in the battle of manila bay in the philippines the year before.
the arch was intended to be temporary, but remained in place until 1901 when efforts to have the arch rebuilt in stone failed, and it was demolished.
fifteen years passed, and in 1918 mayor john f. hylan had a victory arch built at about the same location to honor the city's war dead.
thomas hastings designed a triple arch which cost $80,000 and was modeled after the arch of constantine in rome.
once again, a bid to make the arch permanent failed.
the park was the site of an unusual public protest in 1901.  oscar spate, a displaced londoner, convinced the parks commissioner, george clausen, to allow him to pay the city $500 a year to put 200 cushioned rocking chairs in madison square park, union square, and central park and charge the public 5 cents for their use.
free benches were moved away from shaded areas, and spate's chairs replaced them.
when a heat wave hit the city in july, people in madison park refused to pay the nickel that was now required to sit in the shade.
the police became involved, and newspapers like the sun and william randolph hearst's evening journal took up the cause.
people began going to the park with the intent of sitting and refusing to pay, and a riot occurred involving a thousand men and boys, who chased the chairs' attendant out of the park and overturned and broke up chairs and benches.
the police were called, but the disturbance nevertheless continued for several days.
on july 11, clausen annulled the city's 5-year contract with spate (whose real name was reginald seymour), prompting a celebration with bands and fireworks in madison square park attended by 10,000 people.
spate went to court and got a preliminary injunction against clausen's breaking of the contract, but the judge refused to allow him to force the public to pay.
the evening journal followed by asking for an injunction against pay chairs, and when this was granted spate gave up.
he sold the chairs to wanamaker's, where they were advertised as "historic chairs".
two months later, in september, the seventy-first regiment band played "nearer, my god, to thee" in the park as recognition of the death by assassination of president william mckinley.
the hymn had been mckinley's favorite.
in 1908, the new york herald installed a giant searchlight among the girders of the metropolitan life tower to signal election results.
a northward beam signaled a win for the republican candidate, and a southward beam for the democrat.
the beam went north, signaling the victory of republican william howard taft.
america's first community christmas tree was illuminated in madison square park on december 24, 1912, an event which is commemorated by the illuminated star of hope on a tall pole, installed in 1916 at the southern end of the park.
today the madison square park conservancy continues to present an annual tree-lighting ceremony sponsored by local businesses.
author willa cather described madison square around 1915 in her novel my mortal enemy (1926):
madison square was then at the parting of the ways; had a double personality, half commercial, half social, with shops to the south and residences to the north.
it seemed to me so neat, after the raggedness of our western cities; so protected by good manners and courtesy—like an open-air drawing-room.
i could well imagine a winter dancing party being given there, or a reception for some distinguished european visitor.
in the early part of the 20th century, the neighborhood around madison square garden became known for the number of clothing manufacturers who had set up shop there, as well as industrial concerns such as the lionel train company, which had its headquarters there, where it displayed its first model train layout.
lionel's competitor, the a. c. gilbert company, set up its new york "hall of science" in the neighborhood as well, in 1941, on 25th street across from worth square, in a building that still stands, addressed as 202 fifth avenue; gilbert also displayed its train layouts.
lionel eventually bought up gilbert in 1967.
the toy industry gravitated to the area during world war i, with a number of toy manufacturers having locations at 200 fifth avenue – where the fifth avenue hotel once stood – and which eventually became the international toy center.
in 1967, the center expanded up broadway to an additional building at 1107 broadway, and the two were connected by a pedestrian bridge.
the toy center was for many years the site of the annual new york toy fair until 2005, when the center closed.
some of the major manufacturers, such as mattel and hasbro, expanded out of the toy center building into their own headquarters nearby, mattel on west 23rd street and hasbro on sixth avenue.
in 1936, to commemorate the centennial of the opening of madison avenue, the fifth avenue association donated an oak from montpelier, the virginia estate of former president james madison.
it is located toward the center of the eastern perimeter of the park.
the new york city department of traffic announced a plan in 1964 to build a parking garage underneath the park, much like the boston common, union square in san francisco and macarthur park in los angeles.
the plan was successfully blocked by preservationists, who cited concerns about the damage that the excavation would cause to the park, particularly the roots of its many trees.
on october 17, 1966, a fire at 7 east 23rd street resulted in one of the deadliest building collapse in the history of the new york city fire department, when 12 fdny staff—two chiefs, two lieutenants, and eight firefighters—were killed.
this was the department's greatest loss of life before the september 11 terrorist attacks.
a plaque honoring the victims can be seen on madison green, the apartment building currently occupying the site.
by the middle of the 20th century, some of the buildings in the neighborhood were half-empty, and it was widely recognized that the park needed to be restored and renovated.
efforts began in 1979 with a privately funded program to clean up and maintain the park, the first time that non-public funding was used in new york city for long-term work in the city's parks.
then, in november 1986, ground was broken on what was to become the full-scale restoration of the park.
phase one of the project, involving the north end of the park and worth square, was completed in 1988, and included the addition of a playground in the northeast corner.
phase two was to have begun in november 1987,  but never got started, leaving the south end of the park unrestored for 11 years.
in 1997, the new york city department of parks and recreation asked the city parks foundation to organize an effort to raise funds to complete the revitalization.
their "campaign for the new madison square park" lead to the renovation and restoration of the park, the addition of a dog run and the return of 1,200 square feet (110 m2) to the southeast corner.
an outgrowth of the fund-raising campaign was the formation of madison square park conservancy, a public-private partnership whose mission is to keep it "a bright, beautiful and active public park."
one amenity, added to the park in july 2004, is the shake shack, a popular permanent stand that serves hamburgers, hot dogs, shakes and other similar food, as well as wine.
its distinctive building, which was designed by sculpture in the environment, an architectural and environmental design firm based in lower manhattan, sits near the southeast entrance to the park.
in 2010, park designer and horticulturalist lynden miller was hired to reconfigure the planting beds.
the names of the neighborhoods around madison square have changed frequently, and continue to do so.
around the park and to the south is the flatiron district, an area that, since the 1980s, has changed from a primarily commercial district with many photographer's studios—located there because of the relatively cheap rents—into a prime residential area.
rose hill is to the north and east of the park, while nomad is to the north and chelsea is to the west.
within the area, madison avenue continues to be primarily a business district, while broadway just north of the square holds many small "wholesale" and import shops.
the area west of the square remains mostly commercial, but with many residential structures being built.
in 1989, the city's landmarks preservation commission had created the ladies' mile historic district to protect and preserve the area.
additionally, since 2001, the madison square north historic district for the area north and west of the park, in the neighborhood that since 1999 has been referred to as nomad ("north of madison square park ").
on the south end of madison square, southwest of the park, is the flatiron building, one of the oldest of the original new york skyscrapers, and just to east at 1 madison avenue is the met life tower, built in 1909 and the tallest building in the world until 1913, when the woolworth building was completed.
it is now occupied by credit suisse since metlife moved their headquarters to the panam building.
the 700-foot (210 m) marble clock tower of this building dominates the park.
the met life tower absorbed the site of the architecturally distinguished 1854 building of the former madison square presbyterian church, designed by architect richard upjohn on the southeast corner of 24th street, while the metropolitan life north building replaced the 1906 replacement church on the northeast corner of 24th street and madison, designed by stanford white and demolished in 1919.
nearby, on madison avenue between 26th and 27th streets, on the site of the old madison square garden, is the 40-floor, 615 feet (187 m) high new york life building, built in 1928 and designed by cass gilbert, with a square tower topped by a striking gilded pyramid.
also of note is the statuary adorning the appellate division courthouse of the new york state supreme court on madison avenue at 25th street.
to the west of the flatiron building, at the southwest corner of fifth avenue and 23rd street, is henry j. hardenbergh's western union telegraph building, one of the first commercial buildings in the area.
it was completed in 1884, the same year his dakota apartment building was finished.
one madison, a 50-story residential condominium tower which opened in 2013, is located at 22 east 23rd street, at the foot of madison avenue across from the park.
down the block to the west, on the southeast corner of broadway and 23rd street, with the address of 5 east 22nd street, is the madison green condominium apartment tower.
while not architecturally notable, the building is significant as one of the first signs that the area was rebounding.
the 31-story building was first announced in the mid-1970s, but was not constructed until 1982.  near the other end of the 22nd street block between broadway and park avenue south is the madison square park tower at 45 east 22nd street, a 64-story residential skyscraper which topped-out in 2017 and is expected to open in 2018.
madison square can be reached on the new york city subway via local service on the bmt broadway line (n, ​r, and ​w trains) at the 23rd street station.
in addition, local stops on the irt lexington avenue line (6 and <6>​ trains) and ind sixth avenue line (f, <f>, and ​m trains) are one block away at park avenue south and sixth avenue, respectively.

a column or pillar in architecture and structural engineering is a structural element that transmits, through compression, the weight of the structure above to other structural elements below.
in other words, a column is a compression member.
the term column applies especially to a large round support (the shaft of the column) with a capital and a base or pedestal, which is made of stone, or appearing to be so.
a small wooden or metal support is typically called a post, and supports with a rectangular or other non-round section are usually called piers.
for the purpose of wind or earthquake engineering, columns may be designed to resist lateral forces.
other compression members are often termed "columns" because of the similar stress conditions.
columns are frequently used to support beams or arches on which the upper parts of walls or ceilings rest.
in architecture, "column" refers to such a structural element that also has certain proportional and decorative features.
a column might also be a decorative element not needed for structural purposes; many columns are engaged, that is to say form part of a wall.
a long sequence of columns joined by an entablature is known as a colonnade.
all significant iron age civilizations of the near east and mediterranean made some use of columns.
in ancient egyptian architecture as early as 2600 bc, the architect imhotep made use of stone columns whose surface was carved to reflect the organic form of bundled reeds, like papyrus, lotus and palm.
in later egyptian architecture faceted cylinders were also common.
their form is thought to derive from archaic reed-built shrines.
carved from stone, the columns were highly decorated with carved and painted hieroglyphs, texts, ritual imagery and natural motifs.
egyptian columns are famously present in the great hypostyle hall of karnak (circa 1224 bc), where 134 columns are lined up in sixteen rows, with some columns reaching heights of 24 metres.
one of the most important type are the papyriform columns.
the origin of these columns goes back to the 5th dynasty.
they are composed of lotus (papyrus) stems which are drawn together into a bundle decorated with bands: the capital, instead of opening out into the shape of a bellflower, swells out and then narrows again like a flower in bud.
the base, which tapers to take the shape of a half-sphere like the stem of the lotus, has a continuously recurring decoration of stipules.

some of the most elaborate columns in the ancient world were those of the persians, especially the massive stone columns erected in persepolis.
they included double-bull structures in their capitals.
the hall of hundred columns at persepolis, measuring 70 × 70 metres, was built by the achaemenid king darius i (524–486 bc).
many of the ancient persian columns are standing, some being more than 30 metres tall.
[citation needed] tall columns with bull's head capitals were used for porticoes and to support the roofs of the hypostylehall, partly inspired by the ancient egyptian precedent.
since the columns carried timber beams rather than stone, they could be taller, slimmer and more widely spaced than egyptian ones.
the minoans used whole tree-trunks, usually turned upside down in order to prevent re-growth, stood on a base set in the stylobate (floor base) and topped by a simple round capital.
these were then painted as in the most famous minoan palace of knossos.
the minoans employed columns to create large open-plan spaces, light-wells and as a focal point for religious rituals.
these traditions were continued by the later mycenaean civilization, particularly in the megaron or hall at the heart of their palaces.
the importance of columns and their reference to palaces and therefore authority is evidenced in their use in heraldic motifs such as the famous lion-gate of mycenae where two lions stand each side of a column.
being made of wood these early columns have not survived, but their stone bases have and through these we may see their use and arrangement in these palace buildings.
the egyptians, persians and other civilizations mostly used columns for the practical purpose of holding up the roof inside a building, preferring outside walls to be decorated with reliefs or painting, but the ancient greeks, followed by the romans, loved to use them on the outside as well, and the extensive use of columns on the interior and exterior of buildings is one of the most characteristic features of classical architecture, in buildings like the parthenon.
the greeks developed the classical orders of architecture, which are most easily distinguished by the form of the column and its various elements.
their doric, ionic, and corinthian orders were expanded by the romans to include the tuscan and composite orders.

columns, or at least large structural exterior ones, became much less significant in the architecture of the middle ages.
the classical forms were abandoned in both byzantine and romanesque architecture in favour of more flexible forms, with capitals often using various types of foliage decoration, and in the west scenes with figures carved in relief.
during the romanesque period, builders continued to reuse and imitate ancient roman columns wherever possible; where new, the emphasis was on elegance and beauty, as illustrated by twisted columns.
often they were decorated with mosaics.

renaissance architecture was keen to revive the classical vocabulary and styles, and the informed use and variation of the classical orders remained fundamental to the training of architects throughout baroque, rococo and neo-classical architecture.
early columns were constructed of stone, some out of a single piece of stone.
monolithic columns are among the heaviest stones used in architecture.
other stone columns are created out of multiple sections of stone, mortared or dry-fit together.
in many classical sites, sectioned columns were carved with a centre hole or depression so that they could be pegged together, using stone or metal pins.
the design of most classical columns incorporates entasis (the inclusion of a slight outward curve in the sides) plus a reduction in diameter along the height of the column, so that the top is as little as 83% of the bottom diameter.
this reduction mimics the parallax effects which the eye expects to see, and tends to make columns look taller and straighter than they are while entasis adds to that effect.
there are flutes and fillets that run up the shaft of columns.
the flute is the part of the column that is indented in with a semi circular shape.
the fillet of the column is the part between each of the flutes on the ionic order columns.
the flute width changes on all tapered columns as it goes up the shaft and stays the same on all non tapered columns.
this was done to the columns to add visual interest to them.
the ionic and the corinthian are the only orders that have fillets and flutes.
the doric style has flutes but not fillets.
doric flutes are connected at a sharp point where the fillets are located on ionic and corinthian order columns.
most classical columns arise from a basis, or base, that rests on the stylobate, or foundation, except for those of the doric order, which usually rest directly on the stylobate.
the basis may consist of several elements, beginning with a wide, square slab known as a plinth.
the simplest bases consist of the plinth alone, sometimes separated from the column by a convex circular cushion known as a torus.
more elaborate bases include two toruses, separated by a concave section or channel known as a scotia or trochilus.
scotiae could also occur in pairs, separated by a convex section called an astragal, or bead, narrower than a torus.
sometimes these sections were accompanied by still narrower convex sections, known as annulets or fillets.
at the top of the shaft is a capital, upon which the roof or other architectural elements rest.
in the case of doric columns, the capital usually consists of a round, tapering cushion, or echinus, supporting a square slab, known as an abax or abacus.
ionic capitals feature a pair of volutes, or scrolls, while corinthian capitals are decorated with reliefs in the form of acanthus leaves.
either type of capital could be accompanied by the same moldings as the base.
in the case of free-standing columns, the decorative elements atop the shaft are known as a finial.
modern columns may be constructed out of steel, poured or precast concrete, or brick, left bare or clad in an architectural covering, or veneer.
used to support an arch, an impost, or pier, is the topmost member of a column.
the bottom-most part of the arch, called the springing, rests on the impost.
as the axial load on a perfectly straight slender column with elastic material properties is increased in magnitude, this ideal column passes through three states: stable equilibrium, neutral equilibrium, and instability.
the straight column under load is in stable equilibrium if a lateral force, applied between the two ends of the column, produces a small lateral deflection which disappears and the column returns to its straight form when the lateral force is removed.
if the column load is gradually increased, a condition is reached in which the straight form of equilibrium becomes so-called neutral equilibrium, and a small lateral force will produce a deflection that does not disappear and the column remains in this slightly bent form when the lateral force is removed.
the load at which neutral equilibrium of a column is reached is called the critical or buckling load.
the state of instability is reached when a slight increase of the column load causes uncontrollably growing lateral deflections leading to complete collapse.
for an axially loaded straight column with any end support conditions, the equation of static equilibrium, in the form of a differential equation, can be solved for the deflected shape and critical load of the column.
with hinged, fixed or free end support conditions the deflected shape in neutral equilibrium of an initially straight column with uniform cross section throughout its length always follows a partial or composite sinusoidal curve shape, and the critical load is given by
fcr≡π2eiminl2(1){\displaystyle f_{cr}\equiv {\frac {\pi ^{2}{\textit {e}}i_{min}}{{l}^{2}}}\qquad (1)}
where e = elastic modulus of the material, imin = the minimal moment of inertia of the cross section, and l = actual length of the column between its two end supports.
a variant of (1) is given by
fcr≡π2et(klr)2(2){\displaystyle f_{cr}\equiv {\frac {\pi ^{2}e_{t}}{({\frac {kl}{r}})^{2}}}\qquad (2)}
where r = radius of gyration of column cross-section which is equal to the square root of (i/a), k = ratio of the longest half sine wave to the actual column length, et = tangent modulus at the stress fcr, and kl = effective length (length of an equivalent hinged-hinged column).
from equation (2) it can be noted that the buckling strength of a column is inversely proportional to the square of its length.
when the critical stress, fcr (fcr =pcr/a, where a = cross-sectional area of the column), is greater than the proportional limit of the material, the column is experiencing inelastic buckling.
since at this stress the slope of the material's stress-strain curve, et (called the tangent modulus), is smaller than that below the proportional limit, the critical load at inelastic buckling is reduced.
more complex formulas and procedures apply for such cases, but in its simplest form the critical buckling load formula is given as equation (3),
fcr≡fy−fy24π2e(klr2)(3){\displaystyle f_{cr}\equiv {f_{y}}-{\frac {f_{y}^{2}}{4\pi ^{2}e}}\left({\frac {kl}{r^{2}}}\right)\qquad (3)}
a column with a cross section that lacks symmetry may suffer torsional buckling (sudden twisting) before, or in combination with, lateral buckling.
the presence of the twisting deformations renders both theoretical analyses and practical designs rather complex.
eccentricity of the load, or imperfections such as initial crookedness, decreases column strength.
if the axial load on the column is not concentric, that is, its line of action is not precisely coincident with the centroidal axis of the column, the column is characterized as eccentrically loaded.
the eccentricity of the load, or an initial curvature, subjects the column to immediate bending.
the increased stresses due to the combined axial-plus-flexural stresses result in a reduced load-carrying ability.
column elements are considered to be massive if their smallest side dimension is equal to or more than 400 mm.
massive columns have the ability to increase in carrying strength over long time periods (even during periods of heavy load).
taking into account the fact, that possible structural loads may increase over time as well (and also the threat of progressive failure), massive columns have an advantage compared to non-massive ones.
when a column is too long to be built or transported in one piece, it has to be extended or spliced at the construction site.
a reinforced concrete column is extended by having the steel reinforcing bars protrude a few inches or feet above the top of the concrete, then placing the next level of reinforcing bars to overlap, and pouring the concrete of the next level.
a steel column is extended by welding or bolting splice plates on the flanges and webs or walls of the columns to provide a few inches or feet of load transfer from the upper to the lower column section.
a timber column is usually extended by the use of a steel tube or wrapped-around sheet-metal plate bolted onto the two connecting timber sections.
a column that carries the load down to a foundation must have means to transfer the load without overstressing the foundation material.
reinforced concrete and masonry columns are generally built directly on top of concrete foundations.
when seated on a concrete foundation, a steel column must have a base plate to spread the load over a larger area, and thereby reduce the bearing pressure.
the base plate is a thick, rectangular steel plate usually welded to the bottom end of the column.
the roman author vitruvius, relying on the writings (now lost) of greek authors, tells us that the ancient greeks believed that their doric order developed from techniques for building in wood.
the earlier smoothed tree-trunk was replaced by a stone cylinder.
the doric order is the oldest and simplest of the classical orders.
it is composed of a vertical cylinder that is wider at the bottom.
it generally has neither a base nor a detailed capital.
it is instead often topped with an inverted frustum of a shallow cone or a cylindrical band of carvings.
it is often referred to as the masculine order because it is represented in the bottom level of the colosseum and the parthenon, and was therefore considered to be able to hold more weight.
the height-to-thickness ratio is about 8:1. the shaft of a doric column is almost always fluted.
the greek doric, developed in the western dorian region of greece, is the heaviest and most massive of the orders.
it rises from the stylobate without any base; it is from four to six times as tall as its diameter; it has twenty broad flutes; the capital consists simply of a banded necking swelling out into a smooth echinus, which carries a flat square abacus; the doric entablature is also the heaviest, being about one-fourth the height column.
the greek doric order was not used after c. 100 b.c.
until its “rediscovery” in the mid-eighteenth century.
the tuscan order, also known as roman doric, is also a simple design, the base and capital both being series of cylindrical disks of alternating diameter.
the shaft is almost never fluted.
the proportions vary, but are generally similar to doric columns.
height to width ratio is about 7:1.
the ionic column is considerably more complex than the doric or tuscan.
it usually has a base and the shaft is often fluted (it has grooves carved up its length).
the capital features a volute, an ornament shaped like a scroll, at the four corners.
the height-to-thickness ratio is around 9:1. due to the more refined proportions and scroll capitals, the ionic column is sometimes associated with academic buildings.
ionic style columns were used on the second level of the colosseum.
the corinthian order is named for the greek city-state of corinth, to which it was connected in the period.
however, according to the architectural historian vitruvius, the column was created by the sculptor callimachus, probably an athenian, who drew acanthus leaves growing around a votive basket.
in fact, the oldest known corinthian capital was found in bassae, dated at 427 bc.
it is sometimes called the feminine order because it is on the top level of the colosseum and holding up the least weight, and also has the slenderest ratio of thickness to height.
height to width ratio is about 10:1.
the composite order draws its name from the capital being a composite of the ionic and corinthian capitals.
the acanthus of the corinthian column already has a scroll-like element, so the distinction is sometimes subtle.
generally the composite is similar to the corinthian in proportion and employment, often in the upper tiers of colonnades.
height to width ratio is about 11:1 or 12:1.
a solomonic column, sometimes called "barley sugar", begins on a base and ends in a capital, which may be of any order, but the shaft twists in a tight spiral, producing a dramatic, serpentine effect of movement.
solomonic columns were developed in the ancient world, but remained rare there.
a famous marble set, probably 2nd century, was brought to old st. peter's basilica by constantine i, and placed round the saint's shrine, and was thus familiar throughout the middle ages, by which time they were thought to have been removed from the temple of jerusalem.
the style was used in bronze by bernini for his spectacular st. peter's baldachin, actually a ciborium (which displaced constantine's columns), and thereafter became very popular with baroque and rococo church architects, above all in latin america, where they were very often used, especially on a small scale, as they are easy to produce in wood by turning on a lathe (hence also the style's popularity for spindles on furniture and stairs).
a caryatid is a sculpted female figure serving as an architectural support taking the place of a column or a pillar supporting an entablature on her head.
the greek term karyatides literally means "maidens of karyai", an ancient town of peloponnese.
in architecture, an engaged column is a column embedded in a wall and partly projecting from the surface of the wall, sometimes defined as semi or three-quarter detached.
engaged columns are rarely found in classical greek architecture, and then only in exceptional cases, but in roman architecture they exist in abundance, most commonly embedded in the cella walls of pseudoperipteral buildings.
pillar tombs are monumental graves, which typically feature a single, prominent pillar or column, often made of stone.
a number of world cultures incorporated pillars into tomb structures.
in the ancient greek colony of lycia in anatolia, one of these edifices is located at the tomb of xanthos.
in the town of hannassa in southern somalia, ruins of houses with archways and courtyards have also been found along with other pillar tombs, including a rare octagonal tomb.

monument to the heroes of perekop (russian: памятник героям перекопа) is a memorial sign installed in moscow on perekopskaya street near the intersection with sevastopol avenue on november 15, 1972. the monument is dedicated to the siege of perekop during the russian civil war in the autumn of 1920 and the crimean offensive by the red army in the spring of 1944.
the memorial sign is a wall of red granite standing on two granite blocks depicting an image of a red army man in budyonovka and a soldier wearing a helmet.
on the left part, the inscription "heroes of perekop.
1920-1944" is written.
on the opposite side, divisions which participated in the battles for the dig in 1920 and 1944 are listed.
the monument is installed on an open area lined with light plates and framed flower beds.
the monument was constructed by the initiative and means of students of the neighboring school no.
531 (now the structural subdivision no.
2 of the school no.
554), where the history of the heroes of perekop was studied for a long time.
the monument is made in accordance to the sketch of the school student vadim ermolaev.
the creation of the memorial was also attended by the architect vl voskresensky and the head of the school circle of fine arts yu.
s. zimin.
the monument belongs to the category of "urban sculpture".
annually on victory day, flowers are placed on the monument.

josé bonifácio de andrada e silva (portuguese pronunciation: [ʒuˈzɛ buniˈfasju dʒi ɐ̃ˈdɾadɐ i ˈsiwvɐ], 13 june 1763 – 6 april 1838) was a brazilian statesman, naturalist, professor and poet, born in santos, são paulo, then part of the portuguese empire.
he was one of the most important mentors of brazilian independence, and his actions were decisive for the success of emperor pedro i. he supported public education, was an abolitionist and suggested that a new national capital be created in brazil's underdeveloped interior (effected over a century later as brasília).
his career as naturalist was marked by the discovery of four new minerals.
in 1800, andrada e silva was appointed professor of geology at coimbra, and soon after inspector-general of the portuguese mines; and in 1812 he was made perpetual secretary of the lisbon academy of sciences.
returning to the colony in 1819, he urged dom pedro i to resist the recall of the lisbon court, and was appointed one of his ministers in 1821. when the independence of brazil was declared, andrada e silva was made minister of the interior and of foreign affairs; and when it was established, he was again elected by the constituent assembly.
he was also the author of the abolition project in brazil, presented to the constituent assembly in 1823.  but his democratic principles resulted in his dismissal from office in july 1823.
josé bonifácio spent part of his life in europe.
in his trips around europe he studied chemistry and mineralogy with other scientists.
he collected data, made scientific experiences and discovered 4 new minerals and 8 types of unknown species.
the mineral andradite is named after him.
among his other discoveries was petalite, a lithium-containing material, first discovered by andrade toward the end of the 18th century on a trip to sweden, and it was in this mineral swedish chemists first discovered lithium.
he also was the first to discover another important lithium-containing mineral spodumene from the same source, the island of utö in the stockholm archipelago of sweden.
in 1797 he was elected a foreign member of the royal swedish academy of sciences.
graduated in law and natural philosophy in coimbra, he joined the academia das ciências de lisboa (science academy of lisbon).
he taught geognosy at the university of coimbra in portugal.
knowing twelve languages, he could speak four.
in 1819, he travelled back to brazil where he continued to conduct scientific research.
a talented man having an unquiet temperament, he was also appointed minister for kingdom and overseas affairs and became the de facto prime minister.
his relationship with the prince became incompatible and he decided to join the opposition.
in 1823 he was exiled and went to live in bordeaux where, in 1825, come out his "poesias avulsas" (sundry poetries).
to publish them he used the pseudonym américo elísio.
on the dissolution of the assembly in november (the night of agony), he was arrested and banished to france, where he lived in exile near bordeaux until 1829, when he was permitted to return to brazil.
in 1831 when dom pedro i abdicated from the throne, he was appointed by the former emperor to be the tutor of the emperor's son.
since he did not agree with the regent's government he tried to reestablish the empire.
after being again arrested in 1833 and tried for intriguing on behalf of dom pedro i, he passed the rest of his days in retirement at the city of niterói.
he lost his duties of tutor and was accused of being a traitor, but he was eventually pardoned.
in december 1836, he contracted tuberculosis.
he died of the disease on 6 april 1838 in niterói.
josé bonifácio had also been engaged in literature.
his work poesias avulsas that come out in bordeaux were republished in brazil, in 1861, by the publisher laemmert.
in brazil it received the title "poesias" (poetries) and the publication had the coordination of joaquim norberto de sousa.
in 1942 afrânio peixoto prepared another issue through the brazilian academy of letters.
this work, prefaced with a text by sérgio buarque de holanda, was also published in a collection, as volume i, idealized by the "instituto nacional do livro" (the national book institute), appearing in 1946 with the title poesias de américo elísio [américo elísio's poetry].
his poetry shows a naturalistic pantheism that expresses his intellectual character and scientific curiosity.
his scientific, political and social works are published in volume iii, compiled and reproduced by edgar cerqueira falcão with the title obras científicas, politicas e sociais de josé bonifácio de andrada e silva.
its third edition came out in 1963 to celebrate the bicentennial of the patriarch of the independence.
francisco paulo mignone (september 3, 1897, são paulo – february 19, 1986, rio de janeiro) was one of the most significant figures in brazilian classical music, and one of the most significant brazilian composers after heitor villa-lobos.
in 1968 he was chosen as brazilian composer of the year.
a graduate of the são paulo conservatory and then of the milan conservatory, mignone returned to são paulo in 1929 to teach harmony, and in 1933 took a post in rio de janeiro at the escola nacional de música.
mignone was a versatile composer, dividing his output nearly evenly between solo songs, piano pieces, chamber instrumental works, orchestral works, and choral works.
in addition, he wrote five operas and eight ballets.
son of the italian immigrant flutist alferio mignone, francisco was already making his mark upon the musical world of brazil by the time he was 10 years old, gaining notoriety around his district playing in the choro style.
a pianist and orchestra leader at 13, he had gained some fame composing and playing under the pseudonym of chico bororó, keeping these activities separate from his formal music training.
his works may be divided into three compositional periods.
his early works show the italian influences and romantic sensibilities of his training in milan.
an orchestral piece from his first opera of this early period was premiered in rio de janeiro by richard strauss conducting the vienna philharmonic orchestra, in 1923.
much of mignone's music is strongly nationalistic in flavor; influenced by the nationalistic movement of his former schoolmate and teacher, the musicologist and writer mário de andrade, mignone uses the folk and popular melodies and forms of his native brazil as a basis for his compositions.
(andrade reportedly said, "in italian music, mignone will be one more among a rich and numerous school, to which he does not add anything.
here, he will be of indispensable value.")
from 1929 until 1960 his work was most strongly characterized by this nationalism, during which he composed such pieces as the fantasias brasileiras and his ballets maracatu do chico rei and leilão.
his solo vocal and piano works of this time earned him particular acclaim for their expression of brazilian musical styles, such as the choro, the modinha, and the valsas (waltzes) reminiscent of strolling serenaders.
mignone's music is noted for its lyricism, colorful instrumentation, and improvisatory style.
most of his early works are tonal, as is typical of the popular and folk music, though later in his career he branched out into polytonal, atonal, and serial writing.
in the late 1950s mignone drifted away from the nationalistic music and toward the then-current trends in academic concert music, composing works such as his 1958 piano concerto, which showcase his skillful instrumentation and bravura writing.
mignone was capable of writing in a variety of styles and his works of the early 1960s and beyond are noted for their eclecticism; it is difficult to find any other unifying feature.
however, he returned to nationalistic writing toward his last few years.
mignone was married with liddy chiafarelli mignone who died in a plane crash in 1962 and after that married with maria josephina mignone with whom he frequently played duets.
mignone died in rio de janeiro, age 88. his wife remains an interpreter of his music to this day.
progresso, a brand of general mills, is an american food company that produces canned soups, canned beans, broths, chili, and other food products.
progresso emerged from the merging of two prominent italian importing companies in new orleans, louisiana.
in 1925, vincent taormina, who had traveled east to start a tomato importing business, and giuseppe uddo merged their companies.
vincent's family owned the "taormina brothers grocery" of new orleans, louisiana.
frank had emigrated from italy and joined his cousin vincent in the venture.
they were so successful selling tomatoes that they sold more orders than they could fill and needed funds to set up the infrastructure for a larger canning operation.
giuseppe uddo, who had already established a national canning operation, brought the taorminas on board to form a new merged company.
the resultant company was "the uddo and taormina corporation" and they created the progresso label, specializing in canned italian food products, which became mostly soup, olive oil, tomatoes, spaghetti, ravioli and beans, sold since 1949.
the pillsbury company acquired progresso in 1988. general mills acquired pillsbury in 2001.
for the last 20 years, progresso soup has been seen as an upmarket alternative to market leader campbell, and as a meal replacement.
progresso cans were both larger than campbell's cans and came "ready-to-heat" rather than being condensed, which helped them attain popularity before campbell's released the competitive and similar "chunky" line of products.
campbell's soup company has since gone on to produce several lines of ready-to-eat soups in reaction to progresso's innovations.

ultramarine is a deep blue color pigment which was originally made by grinding lapis lazuli into a powder.
the name comes from the latin ultramarinus, literally "beyond the sea", because the pigment was imported into europe from mines in afghanistan by italian traders during the 14th and 15th centuries.
ultramarine was the finest and most expensive blue used by renaissance painters.
it was often used for the robes of the virgin mary, and symbolized holiness and humility.
it remained an extremely expensive pigment until a synthetic ultramarine was invented in 1826.
the pigment consists primarily of a zeolite-based mineral containing small amounts of polysulfides.
it occurs in nature as a proximate component of lapis lazuli containing a blue cubic mineral called lazurite.
in the colour index international, the pigment of ultramarine is identified as p. blue 29 77007. the major component of lazurite is a complex sulfur-containing sodium-silicate (na8–10al6si6o24s2–4), which makes ultramarine the most complex of all mineral pigments.
some chloride is often present in the crystal lattice as well.
the blue color of the pigment is due to the s−3 radical anion, which contains an unpaired electron.
the raw materials used in the manufacture of synthetic ultramarine are the following:
the preparation is typically made in steps:
"ultramarine poor in silica" is obtained by fusing a mixture of soft clay, sodium sulfate, charcoal, sodium carbonate and sulfur.
the product is at first white, but soon turns green "green ultramarine" when it is mixed with sulfur and heated.
the sulfur burns, and a fine blue pigment is obtained.
"ultramarine rich in silica" is generally obtained by heating a mixture of pure clay, very fine white sand, sulfur and charcoal in a muffle furnace.
a blue product is obtained at once, but a red tinge often results.
the different ultramarines—green, blue, red and violet—are finely ground and washed with water.
synthetic ultramarine is a more vivid blue than natural ultramarine, since the particles in synthetic ultramarine are smaller and more uniform than the particles in natural ultramarine and therefore diffuse light more evenly.
its color is unaffected by light nor by contact with oil or lime as used in painting.
hydrochloric acid immediately bleaches it with liberation of hydrogen sulfide.
even a small addition of zinc oxide to the reddish varieties especially causes a considerable diminution in the intensity of the color.

ultramarine is the aluminosilicate zeolite with a sodalite structure.
sodalite consists of interconnected aluminosilicate cages.
some of these cages contain polysulfide (sn−x) groups that are the chromophore (color centre).
the negative charge on these ions is balanced by na+ ions that also occupy these cages.
the chromophore is proposed to be s−4 or s4.
synthetic ultramarine, being very cheap, is largely used for wall painting, the printing of paper hangings and calico, etc., and also as a corrective for the yellowish tinge often present in things meant to be white, such as linen, paper, etc.
bluing or "laundry blue" is a suspension of synthetic ultramarine (or the chemically different prussian blue) that is used for this purpose when washing white clothes.
it is also often found in make-up such as mascaras or eye shadows.
large quantities are used in the manufacture of paper, and especially for producing a kind of pale blue writing paper which was popular in britain.
during world war i, the raf painted the outer roundels with a color made from ultramarine blue.
this became bs 108(381c) aircraft blue.
it was replaced in the 1960s by a new color made on phthalocyanine blue, bs110(381c) roundel blue.
the name derives from middle latin ultramarinus, literally "beyond the sea" because it was imported from asia by sea.
in the past, it has also been known as azzurrum ultramarine, azzurrum transmarinum, azzuro oltramarino, azur d'acre, pierre d'azur, lazurstein.
current terminology for ultramarine includes natural ultramarine (english), outremer lapis (french), ultramarin echt (german), oltremare genuino (italian), and ultramarino verdadero (spanish).
the first recorded use of ultramarine as a color name in english was in 1598.
the first noted use of lapis lazuli as a pigment can be seen in the 6th and 7th-century ad cave paintings in afghanistani zoroastrian and buddhist temples, near the most famous source of the mineral.
lapis lazuli has also been identified in chinese paintings from the 10th and 11th centuries, in indian mural paintings from the 11th, 12th, and 17th centuries, and on anglo-saxon and norman illuminated manuscripts from c.1100.
the wilton diptych (1395–1399) is an example of the use of ultramarine in 14th century england
the blue robes of the virgin mary by masaccio (1426) were painted with ultramarine.
pietro perugino economized on this painting of the virgin mary (about 1500) by using azurite for the underpainting of the robe, then adding a layer of ultramarine on top.
titian made dramatic use of ultramarine in the sky and draperies of bacchus and ariadne (1520–23).
during the renaissance, ultramarine was the finest and most expensive blue that could be used by painters.
the 15th century artist cennino cennini wrote in his painters' handbook: "ultramarine blue is a glorious, lovely and absolutely perfect pigment beyond all the pigments.
it would not be possible to say anything about or do anything to it which would not make it more so."
natural ultramarine is the most difficult pigment to grind by hand, and for all except the highest quality of mineral, sheer grinding and washing produces only a pale grayish blue powder.
at the beginning of the 13th century, an improved method came into use, described by cennino cennini in the 15th century.
this process consisted of mixing the ground material with melted wax, resins, and oils, wrapping the resulting mass in a cloth, and then kneading it in a dilute lye solution.
the blue particles collect at the bottom of the pot, while the impurities and colorless crystals remain.
this process was performed at least three times, with each successive extraction generating a lower quality material.
the final extraction, consisting largely of colorless material as well as a few blue particles, brings forth ultramarine ash which is prized as a glaze for its pale blue transparency.
the pigment was most extensively used during the 14th through 15th centuries, as its brilliance complemented the vermilion and gold of illuminated manuscripts and italian panel paintings.
it was valued chiefly on account of its brilliancy of tone and its inertness in opposition to sunlight, oil, and slaked lime.
it is, however, extremely susceptible to even minute and dilute mineral acids and acid vapors.
dilute hcl, hno3, and h2so4 rapidly destroy the blue color, producing hydrogen sulfide (h2s) in the process.
acetic acid attacks the pigment at a much slower rate than mineral acids.
ultramarine was only used for frescoes when it was applied "secco" because fresco's absorption rate made its use cost prohibitive.
the pigment was mixed with a binding medium like egg to form a tempera and applied over dry plaster (such as giotto di bondone's frescos in the cappella degli scrovegni or arena chapel in padua).
european artists used the pigment sparingly, reserving their highest quality blues for the robes of mary and the christ child.
as a result of the high price, artists sometimes economized by using a cheaper blue, azurite, for under painting.
most likely imported to europe through venice, the pigment was seldom seen in german art or art from countries north of italy.
due to a shortage of azurite in the late 16th and 17th century, the price for the already-expensive ultramarine increased dramatically.

girl with a pearl earring, by johannes vermeer (c. 1665)
lady standing at a virginal, by johannes vermeer (c. 1675)
the turban of the girl with a pearl earring by vermeer is painted with a mixture of ultramarine and lead white, with a thin glaze of pure ultramarine over it.
in vermeer's lady standing at a virginal, the ultramarine pigment in the seat cushion in the foreground has deteriorated and turned paler with time.johannes vermeer made extensive use of ultramarine in his paintings.
in lady standing at a virginal, the young woman's dress is painted with a mixture of ultramarine and green earth, and ultramarine was also used to add shadows in the flesh tones.
scientific analysis by the national gallery in london of lady standing at a virginal showed that the ultramarine in the blue seat cushion in the foreground had degraded and become paler with time; it would have been a deeper blue when originally painted.
the beginning of the development of artificial ultramarine blue was known from goethe.
in about 1787, he observed the blue deposits on the walls of lime kilns near palermo in italy.
he was aware of the use of these glassy deposits as a substitute for lapis lazuli in decorative applications.
he did not, however, mention if it was suitable to grind for a pigment.
in 1814, tassaert observed the spontaneous formation of a blue compound, very similar to ultramarine, if not identical with it, in a lime kiln at st. gobain, which caused the societé pour l'encouragement d'industrie to offer, in 1824, a prize for the artificial production of the precious color.
processes were devised by jean baptiste guimet (1826) and by christian gmelin (1828), then professor of chemistry in tübingen; while guimet kept his process a secret, gmelin published his, and thus became the originator of the "artificial ultramarine" industry.
ultramarine is a blue made from natural lapis lazuli, or its synthetic equivalent which is sometimes called "french ultramarine".
variants of the pigment "ultramarine red", "ultramarine green", "ultramarine violet" are known, and are based on similar chemistry and crystal structure.
more generally "ultramarine blue" can refer to a vivid blue.
the term "ultramarine green" indicates a dark green, barium chromate is sometimes referred to as "ultramarine yellow".
ultramarine pigment has also been termed "gmelin's blue", "guimet's blue", "new blue", "oriental blue" and "permanent blue".
in botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, supporting branches and leaves in most species.
in some usages, the definition of a tree may be narrower, including only woody plants with secondary growth, plants that are usable as lumber or plants above a specified height.
in wider definitions, the taller palms, tree ferns, bananas, and bamboos are also trees.
trees are not a taxonomic group but include a variety of plant species that have independently evolved a trunk and branches as a way to tower above other plants to compete for sunlight.
trees tend to be long-lived, some reaching several thousand years old.
trees have been in existence for 370 million years.
it is estimated that there are just over 3 trillion mature trees in the world.
a tree typically has many secondary branches supported clear of the ground by the trunk.
this trunk typically contains woody tissue for strength, and vascular tissue to carry materials from one part of the tree to another.
for most trees it is surrounded by a layer of bark which serves as a protective barrier.
below the ground, the roots branch and spread out widely; they serve to anchor the tree and extract moisture and nutrients from the soil.
above ground, the branches divide into smaller branches and shoots.
the shoots typically bear leaves, which capture light energy and convert it into sugars by photosynthesis, providing the food for the tree's growth and development.
trees usually reproduce using seeds.
flowers and fruit may be present, but some trees, such as conifers, instead have pollen cones and seed cones.
palms, bananas, and bamboos also produce seeds, but tree ferns produce spores instead.
trees play a significant role in reducing erosion and moderating the climate.
they remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store large quantities of carbon in their tissues.
trees and forests provide a habitat for many species of animals and plants.
tropical rainforests are among the most biodiverse habitats in the world.
trees provide shade and shelter, timber for construction, fuel for cooking and heating, and fruit for food as well as having many other uses.
in parts of the world, forests are shrinking as trees are cleared to increase the amount of land available for agriculture.
because of their longevity and usefulness, trees have always been revered, with sacred groves in various cultures, and they play a role in many of the world's mythologies.
although "tree" is a term of common parlance, there is no universally recognised precise definition of what a tree is, either botanically or in common language.
in its broadest sense, a tree is any plant with the general form of an elongated stem, or trunk, which supports the photosynthetic leaves or branches at some distance above the ground.
trees are also typically defined by height, with smaller plants from 0.5 to 10 m (1.6 to 32.8 ft) being called shrubs, so the minimum height of a tree is only loosely defined.
large herbaceous plants such as papaya and bananas are trees in this broad sense.
a commonly applied narrower definition is that a tree has a woody trunk formed by secondary growth, meaning that the trunk thickens each year by growing outwards, in addition to the primary upwards growth from the growing tip.
under such a definition, herbaceous plants such as palms, bananas and papayas are not considered trees regardless of their height, growth form or stem girth.
certain monocots may be considered trees under a slightly looser definition; while the joshua tree, bamboos and palms do not have secondary growth and never produce true wood with growth rings, they may produce "pseudo-wood" by lignifying cells formed by primary growth.
tree species in the genus dracaena, despite also being monocots, do have secondary growth caused by meristem in their trunk, but it is different from the thickening meristem found in dicotyledonous trees.
aside from structural definitions, trees are commonly defined by use; for instance, as those plants which yield lumber.
the tree growth habit is an evolutionary adaptation found in different groups of plants: by growing taller, trees are able to compete better for sunlight.
trees tend to be tall and long-lived, some reaching several thousand years old.
several trees are among the oldest organisms now living.
trees have modified structures such as thicker stems composed of specialised cells that add structural strength and durability, allowing them to grow taller than many other plants and to spread out their foliage.
they differ from shrubs, which have a similar growth form, by usually growing larger and having a single main stem; but there is no consistent distinction between a tree and a shrub, made more confusing by the fact that trees may be reduced in size under harsher environmental conditions such as on mountains and subarctic areas.
the tree form has evolved separately in unrelated classes of plants in response to similar environmental challenges, making it a classic example of parallel evolution.
with an estimated 60,000-100,000 species, the number of trees worldwide might total twenty-five per cent of all living plant species.
the greatest number of these grow in tropical regions and many of these areas have not yet been fully surveyed by botanists, making tree diversity and ranges poorly known.
the majority of tree species are angiosperms.
there are about 1000 species of gymnosperm trees, including conifers, cycads, ginkgophytes and gnetales; they produce seeds which are not enclosed in fruits, but in open structures such as pine cones, and many have tough waxy leaves, such as pine needles.
most angiosperm trees are eudicots, the "true dicotyledons", so named because the seeds contain two cotyledons or seed leaves.
there are also some trees among the old lineages of flowering plants called  basal angiosperms or paleodicots; these include amborella, magnolia, nutmeg and avocado, while trees such as bamboo, palms and bananas are monocots.
wood gives structural strength to the trunk of most types of tree; this supports the plant as it grows larger.
the vascular system of trees allows water, nutrients and other chemicals to be distributed around the plant, and without it trees would not be able to grow as large as they do.
trees, as relatively tall plants, need to draw water up the stem through the xylem from the roots by the suction produced as water evaporates from the leaves.
if insufficient water is available the leaves will die.
the three main parts of trees include the root, stem, and leaves; they are integral parts of the vascular system which interconnects all the living cells.
in trees and other plants that develop wood, the vascular cambium allows the expansion of vascular tissue that produces woody growth.
because this growth ruptures the epidermis of the stem, woody plants also have a cork cambium that develops among the phloem.
the cork cambium gives rise to thickened cork cells to protect the surface of the plant and reduce water loss.
both the production of wood and the production of cork are forms of secondary growth.
trees are either evergreen, having foliage that persists and remains green throughout the year, or deciduous, shedding their leaves at the end of the growing season and then having a dormant period without foliage.
most conifers are evergreens, but larches (larix and pseudolarix) are deciduous, dropping their needles each autumn, and some species of cypress (glyptostrobus, metasequoia and taxodium) shed small leafy shoots annually in a process known as cladoptosis.
the crown is the spreading top of a tree including the branches and leaves, while the uppermost layer in a forest, formed by the crowns of the trees, is known as the canopy.
a sapling is a young tree.
many tall palms are herbaceous monocots; these do not undergo secondary growth and never produce wood.
in many tall palms, the terminal bud on the main stem is the only one to develop, so they have unbranched trunks with large spirally arranged leaves.
some of the tree ferns, order cyatheales, have tall straight trunks, growing up to 20 metres (66 ft), but these are composed not of wood but of rhizomes which grow vertically and are covered by numerous adventitious roots.
the number of trees in the world, according to a 2015 estimate, is 3.04 trillion, of which 1.39 trillion (46%) are in the tropics or sub-tropics, 0.61 trillion (20%) in the temperate zones, and 0.74 trillion (24%) in the coniferous boreal forests.
the estimate is about eight times higher than previous estimates, and is based on tree densities measured on over 400,000 plots.
it remains subject to a wide margin of error, not least because the samples are mainly from europe and north america.
the estimate suggests that about 15 billion trees are cut down annually and about 5 billion are planted.
in the 12,000 years since the start of human agriculture, the number of trees worldwide has decreased by 46%.
in suitable environments, such as the daintree rainforest in queensland, or the mixed podocarp and broadleaf forest of ulva island, new zealand, forest is the more-or-less stable climatic climax community at the end of a plant succession, where open areas such as grassland are colonised by taller plants, which in turn give way to trees that eventually form a forest canopy.
in cool temperate regions, conifers often predominate; a widely distributed climax community in the far north of the northern hemisphere is moist taiga or northern coniferous forest (also called boreal forest).
taiga is the world's largest land biome, forming 29% of the world's forest cover.
the long cold winter of the far north is unsuitable for plant growth and trees must grow rapidly in the short summer season when the temperature rises and the days are long.
light is very limited under their dense cover and there may be little plant life on the forest floor, although fungi may abound.
similar woodland is found on mountains where the altitude causes the average temperature to be lower thus reducing the length of the growing season.
where rainfall is relatively evenly spread across the seasons in temperate regions, temperate broadleaf and mixed forest typified by species like oak, beech, birch and maple is found.
temperate forest is also found in the southern hemisphere, as for example in the eastern australia temperate forest, characterised by eucalyptus forest and open acacia woodland.
in tropical regions with a monsoon or monsoon-like climate, where a drier part of the year alternates with a wet period as in the amazon rainforest, different species of broad-leaved trees dominate the forest, some of them being deciduous.
in tropical regions with a drier savanna climate and insufficient rainfall to support dense forests, the canopy is not closed, and plenty of sunshine reaches the ground which is covered with grass and scrub.
acacia and baobab are well adapted to living in such areas.
the roots of a tree serve to anchor it to the ground and gather water and nutrients to transfer to all parts of the tree.
they are also used for reproduction, defence, survival, energy storage and many other purposes.
the radicle or embryonic root is the first part of a seedling to emerge from the seed during the process of germination.
this develops into a taproot which goes straight downwards.
within a few weeks lateral roots branch out of the side of this and grow horizontally through the upper layers of the soil.
in most trees, the taproot eventually withers away and the wide-spreading laterals remain.
near the tip of the finer roots are single cell root hairs.
these are in immediate contact with the soil particles and can absorb water and nutrients such as potassium in solution.
the roots require oxygen to respire and only a few species such as mangroves and the pond cypress (taxodium ascendens) can live in permanently waterlogged soil.
in the soil, the roots encounter the hyphae of fungi.
many of these are known as mycorrhiza and form a mutualistic relationship with the tree roots.
some are specific to a single tree species, which will not flourish in the absence of its mycorrhizal associate.
others are generalists and associate with many species.
the tree acquires minerals such as phosphorus from the fungus, while the fungus obtains the carbohydrate products of photosynthesis from the tree.
the hyphae of the fungus can link different trees and a network is formed, transferring nutrients and signals from one place to another.
the fungus promotes growth of the roots and helps protect the trees against predators and pathogens.
it can also limit damage done to a tree by pollution as the fungus accumulate heavy metals within its tissues.
fossil evidence shows that roots have been associated with mycorrhizal fungi since the early paleozoic, four hundred million years ago, when the first vascular plants colonised dry land.
some trees such as the alders (alnus species) have a symbiotic relationship with frankia species, a filamentous bacterium that can fix nitrogen from the air, converting it into ammonia.
they have actinorhizal root nodules on their roots in which the bacteria live.
this process enables the tree to live in low nitrogen habitats where they would otherwise be unable to thrive.
the plant hormones called cytokinins initiate root nodule formation, in a process closely related to mycorrhizal association.
it has been demonstrated that some trees are interconnected through their root system, forming a colony.
the interconnections are made by the inosculation process, a kind of natural grafting or welding of vegetal tissues.
the tests to demonstrate this networking are performed by injecting chemicals, sometimes radioactive, into a tree, and then checking for its presence in neighbouring trees.
the roots are, generally, an underground part of the tree, but some tree species have evolved roots that are aerial.
the common purposes for aerial roots may be of two kinds, to contribute to the mechanical stability of the tree, and to obtain oxygen from air.
an instance of mechanical stability enhancement is the red mangrove that develops prop roots that loop out of the trunk and branches and descend vertically into the mud.
a similar structure is developed by the indian banyan.
many large trees have buttress roots which flare out from the lower part of the trunk.
these brace the tree rather like angle brackets and provide stability, reducing sway in high winds.
they are particularly prevalent in tropical rainforests where the soil is poor and the roots are close to the surface.
some tree species have developed root extensions that pop out of soil, in order to get oxygen, when it is not available in the soil because of excess water.
these root extensions are called pneumatophores, and are present, among others, in black mangrove and pond cypress.
the main purpose of the trunk is to raise the leaves above the ground, enabling the tree to overtop other plants and outcompete them for light.
it also transports water and nutrients from the roots to the aerial parts of the tree, and distributes the food produced by the leaves to all other parts, including the roots.
in the case of angiosperms and gymnosperms, the outermost layer of the trunk is the bark, mostly composed of dead cells of phellem (cork).
it provides a thick, waterproof covering to the living inner tissue.
it protects the trunk against the elements, disease, animal attack and fire.
it is perforated by a large number of fine breathing pores called lenticels, through which oxygen diffuses.
bark is continually replaced by a living layer of cells called the cork cambium or phellogen.
the london plane (platanus × acerifolia) periodically sheds its bark in large flakes.
similarly, the bark of the silver birch (betula pendula) peels off in strips.
as the tree's girth expands, newer layers of bark are larger in circumference, and the older layers develop fissures in many species.
in some trees such as the pine (pinus species) the bark exudes sticky resin which deters attackers whereas in rubber trees (hevea brasiliensis) it is a milky latex that oozes out.
the quinine bark tree (cinchona officinalis) contains bitter substances to make the bark unpalatable.
large tree-like plants with lignified trunks in the pteridophyta, arecales, cycadophyta and poales such as the tree ferns, palms, cycads and bamboos have different structures and outer coverings.
although the bark functions as a protective barrier, it is itself attacked by boring insects such as beetles.
these lay their eggs in crevices and the larvae chew their way through the cellulose tissues leaving a gallery of tunnels.
this may allow fungal spores to gain admittance and attack the tree.
dutch elm disease is caused by a fungus (ophiostoma species) carried from one elm tree to another by various beetles.
the tree reacts to the growth of the fungus by blocking off the xylem tissue carrying sap upwards and the branch above, and eventually the whole tree, is deprived of nourishment and dies.
in britain in the 1990s, 25 million elm trees were killed by this disease.
the innermost layer of bark is known as the phloem and this is involved in the transport of the sap containing the sugars made by photosynthesis to other parts of the tree.
it is a soft spongy layer of living cells, some of which are arranged end to end to form tubes.
these are supported by parenchyma cells which provide padding and include fibres for strengthening the tissue.
inside the phloem is a layer of undifferentiated cells one cell thick called the vascular cambium layer.
the cells are continually dividing, creating phloem cells on the outside and wood cells known as xylem on the inside.
the newly created xylem is the sapwood.
it is composed of water-conducting cells and associated cells which are often living, and is usually pale in colour.
it transports water and minerals from the roots to the upper parts of the tree.
the oldest, inner part of the sapwood is progressively converted into heartwood as new sapwood is formed at the cambium.
the conductive cells of the heartwood are blocked in some species.
heartwood is usually darker in colour than the sapwood.
it is the dense central core of the trunk giving it rigidity.
three quarters of the dry mass of the xylem is cellulose, a polysaccharide, and most of the remainder is lignin, a complex polymer.
a transverse section through a tree trunk or a horizontal core will show concentric circles or lighter or darker wood – tree rings.
these rings are the annual growth rings there may also be rays running at right angles to growth rings.
these are vascular rays which are thin sheets of living tissue permeating the wood.
many older trees may become hollow but may still stand upright for many years.
trees do not usually grow continuously throughout the year but mostly have spurts of active expansion followed by periods of rest.
this pattern of growth is related to climatic conditions; growth normally ceases when conditions are either too cold or too dry.
in readiness for the inactive period, trees form buds to protect the meristem, the zone of active growth.
before the period of dormancy, the last few leaves produced at the tip of a twig form scales.
these are thick, small and closely wrapped and enclose the growing point in a waterproof sheath.
inside this bud there is a rudimentary stalk and neatly folded miniature leaves, ready to expand when the next growing season arrives.
buds also form in the axils of the leaves ready to produce new side shoots.
a few trees, such as the eucalyptus, have "naked buds" with no protective scales and some conifers, such as the lawson's cypress, have no buds but instead have little pockets of meristem concealed among the scale-like leaves.
when growing conditions improve, such as the arrival of warmer weather and the longer days associated with spring in temperate regions, growth starts again.
the expanding shoot pushes its way out, shedding the scales in the process.
these leave behind scars on the surface of the twig.
the whole year's growth may take place in just a few weeks.
the new stem is unlignified at first and may be green and downy.
the arecaceae (palms) have their leaves spirally arranged on an unbranched trunk.
in some tree species in temperate climates, a second spurt of growth, a lammas growth may occur which is believed to be a strategy to compensate for loss of early foliage to insect predators.
primary growth is the elongation of the stems and roots.
secondary growth consists of a progressive thickening and strengthening of the tissues as the outer layer of the epidermis is converted into bark and the cambium layer creates new phloem and xylem cells.
the bark is inelastic.
eventually the growth of a tree slows down and stops and it gets no taller.
if damage occurs the tree may in time become hollow.
leaves are structures specialised for photosynthesis and are arranged on the tree in such a way as to maximise their exposure to light without shading each other.
they are an important investment by the tree and may be thorny or contain phytoliths, lignins, tannins or poisons to discourage herbivory.
trees have evolved leaves in a wide range of shapes and sizes, in response to environmental pressures including climate and predation.
they can be broad or needle-like, simple or compound, lobed or entire, smooth or hairy, delicate or tough, deciduous or evergreen.
the needles of coniferous trees are compact but are structurally similar to those of broad-leaved trees.
they are adapted for life in environments where resources are low or water is scarce.
frozen ground may limit water availability and conifers are often found in colder places at higher altitudes and higher latitudes than broad leaved trees.
in conifers such as fir trees, the branches hang down at an angle to the trunk, enabling them to shed snow.
in contrast, broad leaved trees in temperate regions deal with winter weather by shedding their leaves.
when the days get shorter and the temperature begins to decrease, the leaves no longer make new chlorophyll and the red and yellow pigments already present in the blades become apparent.
synthesis in the leaf of a plant hormone called auxin also ceases.
this causes the cells at the junction of the petiole and the twig to weaken until the joint breaks and the leaf floats to the ground.
in tropical and subtropical regions, many trees keep their leaves all year round.
individual leaves may fall intermittently and be replaced by new growth but most leaves remain intact for some time.
other tropical species and those in arid regions may shed all their leaves annually, such as at the start of the dry season.
many deciduous trees flower before the new leaves emerge.
a few trees do not have true leaves but instead have structures with similar external appearance such as phylloclades – modified stem structures – as seen in the genus phyllocladus.
trees can be pollinated either by wind or by animals, mostly insects.
many angiosperm trees are insect pollinated.
wind pollination may take advantage of increased wind speeds high above the ground.
trees use a variety of methods of seed dispersal.
some rely on wind, with winged or plumed seeds.
others rely on animals, for example with edible fruits.
others again eject their seeds (ballistic dispersal), or use gravity so that seeds fall and sometimes roll.
seeds are the primary way that trees reproduce and their seeds vary greatly in size and shape.
some of the largest seeds come from trees, but the largest tree, sequoiadendron giganteum, produces one of the smallest tree seeds.
the great diversity in tree fruits and seeds reflects the many different ways that tree species have evolved to disperse their offspring.
for a tree seedling to grow into an adult tree it needs light.
if seeds only fell straight to the ground, competition among the concentrated saplings and the shade of the parent would likely prevent it from flourishing.
many seeds such as birch are small and have papery wings to aid dispersal by the wind.
ash trees and maples have larger seeds with blade shaped wings which spiral down to the ground when released.
the kapok tree has cottony threads to catch the breeze.
the seeds of conifers, the largest group of gymnosperms, are enclosed in a cone and most species have seeds that are light and papery that can be blown considerable distances once free from the cone.
sometimes the seed remains in the cone for years waiting for a trigger event to liberate it.
fire stimulates release and germination of seeds of the jack pine, and also enriches the forest floor with wood ash and removes competing vegetation.
similarly, a number of angiosperms including acacia cyclops and acacia mangium have seeds that germinate better after exposure to high temperatures.
the flame tree delonix regia does not rely on fire but shoots its seeds through the air when the two sides of its long pods crack apart explosively on drying.
the miniature cone-like catkins of alder trees produce seeds that contain small droplets of oil that help disperse the seeds on the surface of water.
mangroves often grow in water and some species have propagules, which are buoyant fruits with seeds that start germinating before becoming detached from the parent tree.
these float on the water and may become lodged on emerging mudbanks and successfully take root.
other seeds, such as apple pips and plum stones, have fleshy receptacles and smaller fruits like hawthorns have seeds enclosed in edible tissue; animals including mammals and birds eat the fruits and either discard the seeds, or swallow them so they pass through the gut to be deposited in the animal's droppings well away from the parent tree.
the germination of some seeds is improved when they are processed in this way.
nuts may be gathered by animals such as squirrels that cache any not immediately consumed.
many of these caches are never revisited, the nut-casing softens with rain and frost, and the seed germinates in the spring.
pine cones may similarly be hoarded by red squirrels, and grizzly bears may help to disperse the seed by raiding squirrel caches.
the single extant species of ginkgophyta (ginkgo biloba) has fleshy seeds produced at the ends of short branches on female trees, and gnetum, a tropical and subtropical group of gymnosperms produce seeds at the tip of a shoot axis.
the earliest trees were tree ferns, horsetails and lycophytes, which grew in forests in the carboniferous period.
the first tree may have been wattieza, fossils of which have been found in new york state in 2007 dating back to the middle devonian (about 385 million years ago).
prior to this discovery, archaeopteris was the earliest known tree.
both of these reproduced by spores rather than seeds and are considered to be links between ferns and the gymnosperms which evolved in the triassic period.
the gymnosperms include conifers, cycads, gnetales and ginkgos and these may have appeared as a result of a whole genome duplication event which took place about 319 million years ago.
ginkgophyta was once a widespread diverse group of which the only survivor is the maidenhair tree ginkgo biloba.
this is considered to be a living fossil because it is virtually unchanged from the fossilised specimens found in triassic deposits.
during the mesozoic (245 to 66 million years ago) the conifers flourished and became adapted to live in all the major terrestrial habitats.
subsequently, the tree forms of flowering plants evolved during the cretaceous period.
these began to displace the conifers during the tertiary era (66 to 2 million years ago) when forests covered the globe.
when the climate cooled 1.5 million years ago and the first of four ice ages occurred, the forests retreated as the ice advanced.
in the interglacials, trees recolonised the land that had been covered by ice, only to be driven back again in the next ice age.
trees are an important part of the terrestrial ecosystem, providing essential habitats including many kinds of forest for communities of organisms.
epiphytic plants such as ferns, some mosses, liverworts, orchids and some species of parasitic plants (e.g., mistletoe) hang from branches; these along with arboreal lichens, algae, and fungi provide micro-habitats for themselves and for other organisms, including animals.
leaves, flowers and fruits are seasonally available.
on the ground underneath trees there is shade, and often there is undergrowth, leaf litter, and decaying wood that provide other habitat.
trees stabilise the soil, prevent rapid run-off of rain water, help prevent desertification, have a role in climate control and help in the maintenance of biodiversity and ecosystem balance.
many species of tree support their own specialised invertebrates.
in their natural habitats, 284 different species of insect have been found on the english oak (quercus robur) and 306 species of invertebrate on the tasmanian oak (eucalyptus obliqua).
non-native tree species provide a less biodiverse community, for example in the united kingdom the sycamore (acer pseudoplatanus), which originates from southern europe, has few associated invertebrate species, though its bark supports a wide range of lichens, bryophytes and other epiphytes.
in ecosystems such as mangrove swamps, trees play a role in developing the habitat, since the roots of the mangrove trees reduce the speed of flow of tidal currents and trap water-borne sediment, reducing the water depth and creating suitable conditions for further mangrove colonisation.
thus mangrove swamps tend to extend seawards in suitable locations.
mangrove swamps also provide an effective buffer against the more damaging effects of cyclones and tsunamis.
silviculture is the practice of controlling the establishment, growth, composition, health, and quality of forests, which are areas that have a high density of trees.
cultivated trees are planted and tended by humans, usually because they provide food (fruits or nuts), ornamental beauty, or some type of wood product that benefits people.
an area of land planted with fruit or nut trees is an orchard.
a small wooded area, usually with no undergrowth, is called a grove and a small wood or thicket of trees and bushes is called a coppice or copse.
a large area of land covered with trees and undergrowth is called woodland or forest.
an area of woodland composed primarily of trees established by planting or artificial seeding is known as a plantation.
trees are the source of many of the world's best known fleshy fruits.
apples, pears, plums, cherries and citrus are all grown commercially in temperate climates and a wide range of edible fruits are found in the tropics.
other commercially important fruit include dates, figs and olives.
palm oil is obtained from the fruits of the oil palm (elaeis guineensis).
the fruits of the cocoa tree (theobroma cacao) are used to make cocoa and chocolate and the berries of coffee trees, coffea arabica and coffea canephora, are processed to extract the coffee beans.
in many rural areas of the world, fruit is gathered from forest trees for consumption.
many trees bear edible nuts which can loosely be described as being large, oily kernels found inside a hard shell.
these include coconuts (cocos nucifera), brazil nuts (bertholletia excelsa), pecans (carya illinoinensis), hazel nuts (corylus), almonds (prunus dulcis), walnuts (juglans regia), pistachios (pistacia vera) and many others.
they are high in nutritive value and contain high-quality protein, vitamins and minerals as well as dietary fibre.
a variety of nut oils are extracted by pressing for culinary use; some such as walnut, pistachio and hazelnut oils are prized for their distinctive flavours, but they tend to spoil quickly.
in temperate climates there is a sudden movement of sap at the end of the winter as trees prepare to burst into growth.
in north america, the sap of the sugar maple (acer saccharum) is most often used in the production of a sweet liquid, maple syrup.
about 90% of the sap is water, the remaining 10% being a mixture of various sugars and certain minerals.
the sap is harvested by drilling holes in the trunks of the trees and collecting the liquid that flows out of the inserted spigots.
it is piped to a sugarhouse where it is heated to concentrate it and improve its flavour.
similarly in northern europe the spring rise in the sap of the silver birch (betula pendula) is tapped and collected, either to be drunk fresh or fermented into an alcoholic drink.
in alaska, the sap of the sweet birch (betula lenta) is made into a syrup with a sugar content of 67%.
sweet birch sap is more dilute than maple sap; a hundred litres are required to make one litre of birch syrup.
various parts of trees are used as spices.
these include cinnamon, made from the bark of the cinnamon tree (cinnamomum zeylanicum) and allspice, the dried small fruits of the pimento tree (pimenta dioica).
nutmeg is a seed found in the fleshy fruit of the nutmeg tree (myristica fragrans) and cloves are the unopened flower buds of the clove tree (syzygium aromaticum).
many trees have flowers rich in nectar which are attractive to bees.
the production of forest honey is an important industry in rural areas of the developing world where it is undertaken by small-scale beekeepers using traditional methods.
the flowers of the elder (sambucus) are used to make elderflower cordial and petals of the plum (prunus spp.)
can be candied.
sassafras oil is a flavouring obtained from distilling bark from the roots of the sassafras tree (sassafras albidum).
the leaves of trees are widely gathered as fodder for livestock and some can be eaten by humans but they tend to be high in tannins which makes them bitter.
leaves of the curry tree (murraya koenigii) are eaten, those of kaffir lime (citrus × hystrix) (in thai food) and ailanthus (in korean dishes such as bugak) and those of the european bay tree (laurus nobilis) and the california bay tree (umbellularia californica) are used for flavouring food.
camellia sinensis, the source of tea, is a small tree but seldom reaches its full height, being heavily pruned to make picking the leaves easier.
wood smoke can be used to preserve food.
in the hot smoking process the food is exposed to smoke and heat in a controlled environment.
the food is ready to eat when the process is complete, having been tenderised and flavoured by the smoke it has absorbed.
in the cold process, the temperature is not allowed to rise above 100 °f (38 °c).
the flavour of the food is enhanced but raw food requires further cooking.
if it is to be preserved, meat should be cured before cold smoking.
wood has traditionally been used for fuel, especially in rural areas.
in less developed nations it may be the only fuel available and collecting firewood is often a time consuming task as it becomes necessary to travel further and further afield in the search for fuel.
it is often burned inefficiently on an open fire.
in more developed countries other fuels are available and burning wood is a choice rather than a necessity.
modern wood-burning stoves are very fuel efficient and new products such as wood pellets are available to burn.
charcoal can be made by slow pyrolysis of wood by heating it in the absence of air in a kiln.
the carefully stacked branches, often oak, are burned with a very limited amount of air.
the process of converting them into charcoal takes about fifteen hours.
charcoal is used as a fuel in barbecues and by blacksmiths and has many industrial and other uses.
timber, "trees that are grown in order to produce wood" is cut into lumber (sawn wood) for use in construction.
wood has been an important, easily available material for construction since humans started building shelters.
engineered wood products are available which bind the particles, fibres or veneers of wood together with adhesives to form composite materials.
plastics have taken over from wood for some traditional uses.
wood is used in the construction of buildings, bridges, trackways, piles, poles for power lines, masts for boats, pit props, railway sleepers, fencing, hurdles, shuttering for concrete, pipes, scaffolding and pallets.
in housebuilding it is used in joinery, for making joists, roof trusses, roofing shingles, thatching, staircases, doors, window frames, floor boards, parquet flooring, panelling and cladding.
wood is used to construct carts, farm implements, boats, dugout canoes and in shipbuilding.
it is used for making furniture, tool handles, boxes, ladders, musical instruments, bows, weapons, matches, clothes pegs, brooms, shoes, baskets, turnery, carving, toys, pencils, rollers, cogs, wooden screws, barrels, coffins, skittles, veneers, artificial limbs, oars, skis, wooden spoons, sports equipment and wooden balls.
wood is pulped for paper and used in the manufacture of cardboard and made into engineered wood products for use in construction such as fibreboard, hardboard, chipboard and plywood.
the wood of conifers is known as softwood while that of broad-leaved trees is hardwood.
besides inspiring artists down the centuries, trees have been used to create art.
living trees have been used in bonsai and in tree shaping, and both living and dead specimens have been sculpted into sometimes fantastic shapes.
bonsai (盆栽, lit.
the art of growing a miniature tree or trees in a low-sided pot or tray) is the practice of hòn non bộ originated in china and spread to japan more than a thousand years ago, there are similar practices in other cultures like the living miniature landscapes of vietnam hòn non bộ.
the word bonsai is often used in english as an umbrella term for all miniature trees in containers or pots.
the purposes of bonsai are primarily contemplation (for the viewer) and the pleasant exercise of effort and ingenuity (for the grower).
bonsai practice focuses on long-term cultivation and shaping of one or more small trees growing in a container, beginning with a cutting, seedling, or small tree of a species suitable for bonsai development.
bonsai can be created from nearly any perennial woody-stemmed tree or shrub species that produces true branches and can be cultivated to remain small through pot confinement with crown and root pruning.
some species are popular as bonsai material because they have characteristics, such as small leaves or needles, that make them appropriate for the compact visual scope of bonsai and a miniature deciduous forest can even be created using such species as japanese maple, japanese zelkova or hornbeam.
tree shaping is the practice of changing living trees and other woody plants into man made shapes for art and useful structures.
there are a few different methods of shaping a tree.
there is a gradual method and there is an instant method.
the gradual method slowly guides the growing tip along predetermined pathways over time whereas the instant method bends and weaves saplings 2 to 3 m (6.6 to 9.8 ft) long into a shape that becomes more rigid as they thicken up.
most artists use grafting of living trunks, branches, and roots, for art or functional structures and there are plans to grow "living houses" with the branches of trees knitting together to give a solid, weatherproof exterior combined with an interior application of straw and clay to provide a stucco-like inner surface.
tree shaping has been practised for at least several hundred years, the oldest known examples being the living root bridges built and maintained by the khasi people of meghalaya, india using the roots of the rubber tree (ficus elastica).
cork is produced from the thick bark of the cork oak (quercus suber).
it is harvested from the living trees about once every ten years in an environmentally sustainable industry.
more than half the world's cork comes from portugal and is largely used to make stoppers for wine bottles.
other uses include floor tiles, bulletin boards, balls, footwear, cigarette tips, packaging, insulation and joints in woodwind instruments.
the bark of other varieties of oak has traditionally been used in europe for the tanning of hides though bark from other species of tree has been used elsewhere.
the active ingredient, tannin, is extracted and after various preliminary treatments, the skins are immersed in a series of vats containing solutions in increasing concentrations.
the tannin causes the hide to become supple, less affected by water and more resistant to bacterial attack.
at least 120 drugs come from plant sources, many of them from the bark of trees.
quinine originates from the cinchona tree (cinchona) and was for a long time the remedy of choice for the treatment of malaria.
aspirin was synthesised to replace the sodium salicylate derived from the bark of willow trees (salix) which had unpleasant side effects.
the anti-cancer drug paclitaxel is derived from taxol, a substance found in the bark of the pacific yew (taxus brevifolia).
other tree based drugs come from the paw-paw (carica papaya), the cassia (cassia spp.
), the cocoa tree (theobroma cacao), the tree of life (camptotheca acuminata) and the downy birch (betula pubescens).
the papery bark of the white birch tree (betula papyrifera) was used extensively by native americans.
wigwams were covered by it and canoes were constructed from it.
other uses included food containers, hunting and fishing equipment, musical instruments, toys and sledges.
nowadays, bark chips, a by-product of the timber industry, are used as a mulch and as a growing medium for epiphytic plants that need a soil-free compost.
trees create a visual impact in the same way as do other landscape features and give a sense of maturity and permanence to park and garden.
they are grown for the beauty of their forms, their foliage, flowers, fruit and bark and their siting is of major importance in creating a landscape.
they can be grouped informally, often surrounded by plantings of bulbs, laid out in stately avenues or used as specimen trees.
as living things, their appearance changes with the season and from year to year.
trees are often planted in town environments where they are known as street trees or amenity trees.
they can provide shade and cooling through evapotranspiration, absorb greenhouse gases and pollutants, intercept rainfall, and reduce the risk of flooding.
scientific studies show that street trees help cities be more sustainable, and improve the physical and mental wellbeing of the citizens.
it has been shown that they are beneficial to humans in creating a sense of well-being and reducing stress.
many towns have initiated tree-planting programmes.
in london for example, there is an initiative to plant 20,000 new street trees and to have an increase in tree cover of 5% by 2025, equivalent to one tree for every resident.
latex is a sticky defensive secretion that protects plants against herbivores.
many trees produce it when injured but the main source of the latex used to make natural rubber is the pará rubber tree (hevea brasiliensis).
originally used to create bouncy balls and for the waterproofing of cloth, natural rubber is now mainly used in tyres for which synthetic materials have proved less durable.
the latex exuded by the balatá tree (manilkara bidentata) is used to make golf balls and is similar to gutta-percha, made from the latex of the "getah perca" tree palaquium.
this is also used as an insulator, particularly of undersea cables, and in dentistry, walking sticks and gun butts.
it has now largely been replaced by synthetic materials.
resin is another plant exudate that may have a defensive purpose.
it is a viscous liquid composed mainly of volatile terpenes and is produced mostly by coniferous trees.
it is used in varnishes, for making small castings and in ten-pin bowling balls.
when heated, the terpenes are driven off and the remaining product is called "rosin" and is used by stringed instrumentalists on their bows.
some resins contain essential oils and are used in incense and aromatherapy.
fossilised resin is known as amber and was mostly formed in the cretaceous (145 to 66 million years ago) or more recently.
the resin that oozed out of trees sometimes trapped insects or spiders and these are still visible in the interior of the amber.
the camphor tree (cinnamomum camphora) produces an essential oil and the eucalyptus tree (eucalyptus globulus) is the main source of eucalyptus oil which is used in medicine, as a fragrance and in industry.
dead trees pose a safety risk, especially during high winds and severe storms, and removing dead trees involves a financial burden, whereas the presence of healthy trees can clean the air, increase property values, and reduce the temperature of the built environment and thereby reduce building cooling costs.
during times of drought, trees can fall into water stress, which may cause a tree to become more susceptible to disease and insect problems, and ultimately may lead to a tree's death.
irrigating trees during dry periods can reduce the risk of water stress and death.
trees have been venerated since time immemorial.
to the ancient celts, certain trees, especially the oak, ash and thorn, held special significance as providing fuel, building materials, ornamental objects and weaponry.
other cultures have similarly revered trees, often linking the lives and fortunes of individuals to them or using them as oracles.
in greek mythology, dryads were believed to be shy nymphs who inhabited trees.
the oubangui people of west africa plant a tree when a child is born.
as the tree flourishes, so does the child but if the tree fails to thrive, the health of the child is considered at risk.
when it flowers it is time for marriage.
gifts are left at the tree periodically and when the individual dies, their spirit is believed to live on in the tree.
trees have their roots in the ground and their trunk and branches extended towards the sky.
this concept is found in many of the world's religions as a tree which links the underworld and the earth and holds up the heavens.
in norse mythology, yggdrasil is a central cosmic tree whose roots and branches extend to various worlds.
various creatures live on it.
in india, kalpavriksha is a wish-fulfilling tree, one of the nine jewels that emerged from the primitive ocean.
icons are placed beneath it to be worshipped, tree nymphs inhabit the branches and it grants favours to the devout who tie threads round the trunk.
democracy started in north america when the great peacemaker formed the iroquois confederacy, inspiring the warriors of the original five american nations to bury their weapons under the tree of peace, an eastern white pine (pinus strobus).
in the creation story in the bible, the tree of life and the knowledge of good and evil was planted by god in the garden of eden.
sacred groves exist in china, india, africa and elsewhere.
they are places where the deities live and where all the living things are either sacred or are companions of the gods.
folklore lays down the supernatural penalties that will result if desecration takes place for example by the felling of trees.
because of their protected status, sacred groves may be the only relicts of ancient forest and have a biodiversity much greater than the surrounding area.some ancient indian tree deities, such as puliyidaivalaiyamman, the tamil deity of the  tamarind tree, or kadambariyamman, associated with the kadamba tree were seen as manifestations of a goddess who offers her blessings by giving fruits in abundance.
trees have a theoretical maximum height of 130 m (430 ft), but the tallest known specimen on earth is believed to be a coast redwood (sequoia sempervirens) at redwood national park, california.
it has been named hyperion and is 115.85 m (380.1 ft) tall.
in 2006, it was reported to be 379.1 ft (115.5 m) tall.
the tallest known broad-leaved tree is a mountain ash (eucalyptus regnans) growing in tasmania with a height of 99.8 m (327 ft).
the largest tree by volume is believed to be a giant sequoia (sequoiadendron giganteum) known as the general sherman tree in the sequoia national park in tulare county, california.
only the trunk is used in the calculation and the volume is estimated to be 1,487 m3 (52,500 cu ft).
the oldest living tree with a verified age is also in california.
it is a great basin bristlecone pine (pinus longaeva) growing in the white mountains.
it has been dated by drilling a core sample and counting the annual rings.
it is estimated to currently be 5,069 years old.
[a]
a little farther south, at santa maria del tule, oaxaca, mexico, is the tree with the broadest trunk.
it is a montezuma cypress (taxodium mucronatum) known as árbol del tule and its diameter at breast height is 11.62 m (38.1 ft) giving it a girth of 36.2 m (119 ft).
the tree's trunk is far from round and the exact dimensions may be misleading as the circumference includes much empty space between the large buttress roots.

archery is the art, sport, practice, or skill of using a bow to shoot arrows.
the word comes from the latin arcus.
historically, archery has been used for hunting and combat.
in modern times, it is mainly a competitive sport and recreational activity.
a person who participates in archery is typically called an archer or a bowman, and a person who is fond of or an expert at archery is sometimes called a toxophilite.
the oldest known evidence of arrows comes from the south african site of sibudu cave, where the remains of bone and stone arrowheads  have been found dating approximately 60,000-70,000 years ago.based on indirect evidence, the bow also seems to have appeared or reappeared later in eurasia, near the transition from the upper paleolithic to the mesolithic.
the earliest definite remains of bow and arrow from europe are possible fragments from germany found at mannheim-vogelstang dated 17,500-18,000 years ago, and at stellmoor dated 11,000 years ago.
azilian points found in grotte du bichon, switzerland, alongside the remains of both a bear and a hunter, with flint fragments found in the bear's third vertebra, suggest the use of arrows at 13,500 years ago.
other signs of its use in europe come from the stellmoor [de] in the ahrensburg valley [de] north of hamburg, germany and dates from the late paleolithic, about 10,000–9000 bc.
the arrows were made of pine and consisted of a main shaft and a 15–20-centimetre-long (5 7⁄8–7 7⁄8 in) fore shaft with a flint point.
there are no definite earlier bows; previous pointed shafts are known, but may have been launched by spear-throwers rather than bows.
the oldest bows known so far comes from the holmegård swamp in denmark.at the site of nataruk in turkana county, kenya, obsidian bladelets found embedded in a skull and within the thoracic cavity of another skeleton, suggest the use of stone-tipped arrows as weapons about 10,000 years ago.
bows eventually replaced the spear-thrower as the predominant means for launching shafted projectiles, on every continent except australasia, though spear-throwers persisted alongside the bow in parts of the americas, notably mexico and among the inuit.
bows and arrows have been present in egyptian and neighboring nubian culture since its respective predynastic and pre-kerma origins.
in the levant, artifacts that could be arrow-shaft straighteners are known from the natufian culture, (c. 10,800–8,300 bc) onwards.
the khiamian and ppn a shouldered khiam-points may well be arrowheads.
classical civilizations, notably the assyrians, greeks, armenians, persians, parthians, indians, koreans, chinese, and japanese fielded large numbers of archers in their armies.
akkadians were the first to use composite bows in war according to the victory stele of naram-sin of akkad.
egyptians referred to nubia as "ta-seti," or "the land of the bow," since the nubians were known to be expert archers, and by the 16th century bc egyptians were using the composite bow in warfare.
the bronze age aegean cultures were able to deploy a number of state-owned specialized bow makers for warfare and hunting purposes already from the 15th century bc.
the welsh longbow proved its worth for the first time in continental warfare at the battle of crécy.
in the americas archery was widespread at european contact.
archery was highly developed in asia.
the sanskrit term for archery, dhanurveda, came to refer to martial arts in general.
in east asia, goguryeo, one of the three kingdoms of korea was well known for its regiments of exceptionally skilled archers.
central tribesmen of asia (after the domestication of the horse) and american plains indians (after gaining access to horses) became extremely adept at archery on horseback.
lightly armored, but highly mobile archers were excellently suited to warfare in the central asian steppes, and they formed a large part of armies that repeatedly conquered large areas of eurasia.
shorter bows are more suited to use on horseback, and the composite bow enabled mounted archers to use powerful weapons.
empires throughout the eurasian landmass often strongly associated their respective "barbarian" counterparts with the usage of the bow and arrow, to the point where powerful states like the han dynasty referred to their neighbors, the xiong-nu, as "those who draw the bow".
for example, xiong-nu mounted bowmen made them more than a match for the han military, and their threat was at least partially responsible for chinese expansion into the ordos region, to create a stronger, more powerful buffer zone against them.
it is possible that "barbarian" peoples were responsible for introducing archery or certain types of bows to their "civilized" counterparts—the xiong-nu and the han being one example.
similarly, short bows seem to have been introduced to japan by northeast asian groups.
the development of firearms rendered bows obsolete in warfare, although efforts were sometimes made to preserve archery practice.
in england and wales, for example, the government tried to enforce practice with the longbow until the end of the 16th century.
this was because it was recognized that the bow had been instrumental to military success during the hundred years' war.
despite the high social status, ongoing utility, and widespread pleasure of archery in armenia, china, egypt, england and wales, america, india, japan, korea, turkey and elsewhere, almost every culture that gained access to even early firearms used them widely, to the neglect of archery.
early firearms were inferior in rate-of-fire, and were very sensitive to wet weather.
however, they had longer effective range and were tactically superior in the common situation of soldiers shooting at each other from behind obstructions.
they also required significantly less training to use properly, in particular penetrating steel armor without any need to develop special musculature.
armies equipped with guns could thus provide superior firepower, and highly trained archers became obsolete on the battlefield.
however, the bow and arrow is still an effective weapon, and archers have seen action in the 21st century.
traditional archery remains in use for sport, and for hunting in many areas.
early recreational archery societies included the finsbury archers and the ancient society of kilwinning archers.
the latter's annual papingo event was first recorded in 1483.
(in this event, archers shoot vertically from the base of an abbey tower to dislodge a wood pigeon placed approximately 30 m or 33 yards above.)
the royal company of archers was formed in 1676 and is one of the oldest sporting bodies in the world.
archery remained a small and scattered pastime, however, until the late 18th century when it experienced a fashionable revival among the aristocracy.
sir ashton lever, an antiquarian and collector, formed the toxophilite society in london in 1781, with the patronage of george, the prince of wales.
archery societies were set up across the country, each with its own strict entry criteria and outlandish costumes.
recreational archery soon became extravagant social and ceremonial events for the nobility, complete with flags, music and 21 gun salutes for the competitors.
the clubs were "the drawing rooms of the great country houses placed outside" and thus came to play an important role in the social networks of the local upper class.
as well as its emphasis on display and status, the sport was notable for its popularity with females.
young women could not only compete in the contests but retain and show off their sexuality while doing so.
thus, archery came to act as a forum for introductions, flirtation and romance.
it was often consciously styled in the manner of a medieval tournament with titles and laurel wreaths being presented as a reward to the victor.
general meetings were held from 1789, in which local lodges convened together to standardise the rules and ceremonies.
archery was also co-opted as a distinctively british tradition, dating back to the lore of robin hood and it served as a patriotic form of entertainment at a time of political tension in europe.
the societies were also elitist, and the new middle class bourgeoisie were excluded from the clubs due to their lack of social status.
after the napoleonic wars, the sport became increasingly popular among all classes, and it was framed as a nostalgic reimagining of the preindustrial rural britain.
particularly influential was sir walter scott's 1819 novel, ivanhoe that depicted the heroic character lockseley winning an archery tournament.
the 1840s saw the second attempts at turning the recreation into a modern sport.
the first grand national archery society meeting was held in york in 1844 and over the next decade the extravagant and festive practices of the past were gradually whittled away and the rules were standardized as the 'york round' - a series of shoots at 60 (55), 80 (73), and 100 yards (91 m).
horace a. ford helped to improve archery standards and pioneered new archery techniques.
he won the grand national 11 times in a row and published a highly influential guide to the sport in 1856.
towards the end of the 19th century, the sport experienced declining participation as alternative sports such as croquet and tennis became more popular among the middle class.
by 1889, just 50 archery clubs were left in britain, but it was still included as a sport at the 1900 paris olympics.
in the united states, primitive archery was revived in the early 20th century.
the last of the yahi indian tribe, a native known as ishi, came out of hiding in california in 1911. his doctor, saxton pope, learned many of ishi's traditional archery skills, and popularized them.
[non-primary source needed] the pope and young club, founded in 1961 and named in honor of pope and his friend, arthur young, became one of north america's leading bowhunting and conservation organizations.
founded as a nonprofit scientific organization, the club was patterned after the prestigious boone and crockett club and advocated responsible bowhunting by promoting quality, fair chase hunting, and sound conservation practices.

from the 1920s, professional engineers took an interest in archery, previously the exclusive field of traditional craft experts.
they led the commercial development of new forms of bow including the modern recurve and compound bow.
these modern forms are now dominant in modern western archery; traditional bows are in a minority.
in the 1980s, the skills of traditional archery were revived by american enthusiasts, and combined with the new scientific understanding.
much of this expertise is available in the traditional bowyer's bibles (see further reading).
modern game archery owes much of its success to fred bear, an american bow hunter and bow manufacturer.
deities and heroes in several mythologies are described as archers, including the greek artemis and apollo, the roman diana and cupid, the germanic agilaz, continuing in legends like those of wilhelm tell, palnetoke, or robin hood.
armenian hayk and babylonian marduk, indian karna (also known as radheya/son of radha), abhimanyu, eklavya, arjuna, bhishma, drona, rama, and shiva were known for their shooting skills.
the famous archery competition of hitting the eye of a rotating fish while watching its reflection in the water bowl was one of the many archery skills depicted in the mahabharata.
persian arash was a famous archer.
earlier greek representations of heracles normally depict him as an archer.
archery, and the bow, play an important part in the epic poem the odyssey, when odysseus returns home in disguise and then bests the suitors in an archery competition after hinting at his identity by stringing and drawing his great bow that only he can draw, a similar motif is present in the turkic heroic poem alpamysh.
the nymphai hyperboreioi (νύμφαι ὑπερβόρειοι) were worshipped on the greek island of delos as attendants of artemis, presiding over aspects of archery; hekaerge (ἑκαέργη), represented distancing, loxo (λοξώ), trajectory, and oupis (οὖπις), aim.
yi the archer and his apprentice feng meng appear in several early chinese myths, and the historical character of zhou tong features in many fictional forms.
jumong, the first taewang of the goguryeo kingdom of the three kingdoms of korea, is claimed by legend to have been a near-godlike archer.
archery features in the story of oguz khagan.
similarly, archery and the bow feature heavily into historical korean identity.
in west african yoruba belief, osoosi is one of several deities of the hunt who are identified with bow and arrow iconography and other insignia associated with archery.
while there is great variety in the construction details of bows (both historic and modern), all bows consist of a string attached to elastic limbs that store mechanical energy imparted by the user drawing the string.
bows may be broadly split into two categories: those drawn by pulling the string directly and those that use a mechanism to pull the string.
directly drawn bows may be further divided based upon differences in the method of limb construction, notable examples being self bows, laminated bows and composite bows.
bows can also be classified by the bow shape of the limbs when unstrung; in contrast to traditional european straight bows, a recurve bow and some types of longbow have tips that curve away from the archer when the bow is unstrung.
the cross-section of the limb also varies; the classic longbow is a tall bow with narrow limbs that are d-shaped in cross section, and the flatbow has flat wide limbs that are approximately rectangular in cross-section.
cable-backed bows use cords as the back of the bow; the draw weight of the bow can be adjusted by changing the tension of the cable.
they were widespread among inuit who lacked easy access to good bow wood.
one variety of cable-backed bow is the penobscot bow or wabenaki bow, invented by frank loring (chief big thunder) about 1900. it consists of a small bow attached by cables on the back of a larger main bow.
in different cultures, the arrows are released from either the left or right side of the bow, and this affects the hand grip and position of the bow.
in arab archery, turkish archery and kyūdō, the arrows are released from the right hand side of the bow, and this affects construction of the bow.
in western archery, the arrow is usually released from the left hand side of the bow for a right-handed archer.
compound bows are designed to reduce the force required to hold the string at full draw, hence allowing the archer more time to aim with less muscular stress.
most compound designs use cams or elliptical wheels on the ends of the limbs to achieve this.
a typical let-off is anywhere from 65% to 80%.
for example, a 60-pound (27 kg) bow with 80% let-off only requires 12 pounds-force (5.4 kgf; 53 n) to hold at full draw.
up to 99% let-off is possible.
the compound bow was invented by holless wilbur allen in the 1960s (a us patent was filed in 1966 and granted in 1969) and it has become the most widely used type of bow for all forms of archery in north america.
mechanically drawn bows typically have a stock or other mounting, such as the crossbow.
crossbows typically have shorter draw lengths compared to compound bows.
because of this, heavier draw weights are required to achieve the same energy transfer to the arrow.
these mechanically drawn bows also have devices to hold the tension when the bow is fully drawn.
they are not limited by the strength of a single archer and larger varieties have been used as siege engines.
the most common form of arrow consists of a shaft, with an arrowhead at the front end, and fletchings and a nock at the other end.
arrows across time and history have normally been carried in a container known as a quiver, which can take many different forms.
shafts of arrows are typically composed of solid wood, bamboo, fiberglass, aluminium alloy, carbon fiber, or composite materials.
wooden arrows are prone to warping.
fiberglass arrows are brittle, but can be produced to uniform specifications easily.
aluminium shafts were a very popular high-performance choice in the latter half of the 20th century, due to their straightness, lighter weight, and subsequently higher speed and flatter trajectories.
carbon fiber arrows became popular in the 1990s because they are very light, flying even faster and flatter than aluminium arrows.
today, the most popular arrows at tournaments and olympic events are made of composite materials, in particular the x10 and a/c/e, made by easton,
the arrowhead is the primary functional component of the arrow.
some arrows may simply use a sharpened tip of the solid shaft, but separate arrowheads are far more common, usually made from metal, stone, or other hard materials.
the most commonly used forms are target points, field points, and broadheads, although there are also other types, such as bodkin, judo, and blunt heads.
fletching is traditionally made from bird feathers, but solid plastic vanes and thin sheet-like spin vanes are used.
they are attached near the nock (rear) end of the arrow with thin double sided tape, glue, or, traditionally, sinew.
the most common configuration in all cultures is three fletches, though as many as six have been used.
two makes the arrow unstable in flight.
when the arrow is three-fletched, the fletches are equally spaced around the shaft, with one placed such that it is perpendicular to the bow when nocked on the string, though variations are seen with modern equipment, especially when using the modern spin vanes.
this fletch is called the "index fletch" or "cock feather" (also known as "the odd vane out" or "the nocking vane"), and the others are sometimes called the "hen feathers".
commonly, the cock feather is of a different color.
however, if archers are using fletching made of feather or similar material, they may use same color vanes, as different dyes can give varying stiffness to vanes, resulting in less precision.
when an arrow is four-fletched, two opposing fletches are often cock feathers, and occasionally the fletches are not evenly spaced.
the fletching may be either parabolic cut (short feathers in a smooth parabolic curve) or shield cut (generally shaped like half of a narrow shield), and is often attached at an angle, known as helical fletching, to introduce a stabilizing spin to the arrow while in flight.
whether helical or straight fletched, when natural fletching (bird feathers) is used it is critical that all feathers come from the same side of the bird.
oversized fletchings can be used to accentuate drag and thus limit the range of the arrow significantly; these arrows are called flu-flus.
misplacement of fletchings can change the arrow's flight path dramatically.
dacron and other modern materials offer high strength for their weight and are used on most modern bows.
linen and other traditional materials are still used on traditional bows.
several modern methods of making a bowstring exist, such as the 'endless loop' and 'flemish twist'.
almost any fiber can be made into a bowstring.
the author of arab archery suggests the hide of a young, emaciated camel.
njál's saga describes the refusal of a wife, hallgerður, to cut her hair to make an emergency bowstring for her husband, gunnar hámundarson, who is then killed.
most modern archers wear a bracer (also known as an arm-guard) to protect the inside of the bow arm from being hit by the string and prevent clothing from catching the bowstring.
the bracer does not brace the arm; the word comes from the armoury term "brassard", meaning an armoured sleeve or badge.
the navajo people have developed highly ornamented bracers as non-functional items of adornment.
some archers (nearly all female archers) wear protection on their chests, called chestguards or plastrons.
the myth of the amazons was that they had one breast removed to solve this problem.
roger ascham mentions one archer, presumably with an unusual shooting style, who wore a leather guard for his face.
the drawing digits are normally protected by a leather tab, glove, or thumb ring.
a simple tab of leather is commonly used, as is a skeleton glove.
medieval europeans probably used a complete leather glove.
eurasiatic archers who used the thumb or mongolian draw protected their thumbs, usually with leather according to the author of arab archery, but also with special rings of various hard materials.
many surviving turkish and chinese examples are works of considerable art.
some are so highly ornamented that the users could not have used them to loose an arrow.
possibly these were items of personal adornment, and hence value, remaining extant whilst leather had virtually no intrinsic value and would also deteriorate with time.
in traditional japanese archery a special glove is used that has a ridge to assist in drawing the string.
a release aid is a mechanical device designed to give a crisp and precise loose of arrows from a compound bow.
in the most commonly used, the string is released by a finger-operated trigger mechanism, held in the archer's hand or attached to their wrist.
in another type, known as a back-tension release, the string is automatically released when drawn to a pre-determined tension.
stabilizers are mounted at various points on the bow.
common with competitive archery equipment are special brackets that allow multiple stabilizers to be mounted at various angles to fine tune the bow's balance.
stabilizers aid in aiming by improving the balance of the bow.
sights, quivers, rests, and design of the riser (the central, non-bending part of the bow) make one side of the bow heavier.
one purpose of stabilizers are to offset these forces.
a reflex riser design will cause the top limb to lean towards the shooter.
in this case a heavier front stabilizer is desired to offset this action.
a deflex riser design has the opposite effect and a lighter front stabilizer may be used.
stabilizers can reduce noise and vibration.
these energies are absorbed by viscoelastic polymers, gels, powders, and other materials used to build stabilizers.
stabilizers improve the forgiveness and accuracy by increasing the moment of inertia of the bow to resist movement during the shooting process.
lightweight carbon stabilizers with weighted ends are desirable because they improve the moment of interia while minimizing the weight added.
the standard convention on teaching archery is to hold the bow depending upon eye dominance.
(one exception is in modern kyudo where all archers are trained to hold the bow in the left hand.)
therefore, if one is right-eye dominant, they would hold the bow in the left hand and draw the string with the right hand.
however, not everyone agrees with this line of thought.
a smoother, and more fluid release of the string will produce the most consistently repeatable shots, and therefore may provide greater accuracy of the arrow flight.
some believe that the hand with the greatest dexterity should therefore be the hand that draws and releases the string.
either eye can be used for aiming, and the less dominant eye can be trained over time to become more effective for use.
to assist with this, an eye patch can be temporarily worn over the dominant eye.
the hand that holds the bow is referred to as the bow hand and its arm the bow arm.
the opposite hand is called the drawing hand or string hand.
terms such as bow shoulder or string elbow follow the same convention.
if shooting according to eye dominance, right-eye-dominant archers shooting conventionally hold the bow with their left hand.
if shooting according to hand dexterity, the archer draws the string with the hand that possesses the greatest dexterity, regardless of eye dominance.
to shoot an arrow, an archer first assumes the correct stance.
the body should be at or nearly perpendicular to the target and the shooting line, with the feet placed shoulder-width apart.
as an archer progresses from beginner to a more advanced level other stances such as the "open stance" or the "closed stance" may be used, although many choose to stick with a "neutral stance".
each archer has a particular preference, but mostly this term indicates that the leg furthest from the shooting line is a half to a whole foot-length from the other foot, on the ground.
to load, the bow is pointed toward the ground, tipped slightly clockwise of vertical (for a right handed shooter) and the shaft of the arrow is placed on the arrow rest or shelf.
the back of the arrow is attached to the bowstring with the nock (a small locking groove located at the proximal end of the arrow).
this step is called "nocking the arrow".
typical arrows with three vanes should be oriented such that a single vane, the "cock feather", is pointing away from the bow, to improve the clearance of the arrow as it passes the arrow rest.
a compound bow is fitted with a special type of arrow rest, known as a launcher, and the arrow is usually loaded with the cock feather/vane pointed either up, or down, depending upon the type of launcher being used.
the bowstring and arrow are held with three fingers, or with a mechanical arrow release.
most commonly, for finger shooters, the index finger is placed above the arrow and the next two fingers below, although several other techniques have their adherents around the world, involving three fingers below the arrow, or an arrow pinching technique.
instinctive shooting is a technique eschewing sights and is often preferred by traditional archers (shooters of longbows and recurves).
in either the split finger or three finger under case, the string is usually placed in the first or second joint, or else on the pads of the fingers.
when using a mechanical release aid, the release is hooked onto the d-loop.
another type of string hold, used on traditional bows, is the type favoured by the mongol warriors, known as the "thumb release", style.
this involves using the thumb to draw the string, with the fingers curling around the thumb to add some support.
to release the string, the fingers are opened out and the thumb relaxes to allow the string to slide off the thumb.
when using this type of release, the arrow should rest on the same side of the bow as the drawing hand i.e.
left hand draw = arrow on left side of bow.
the archer then raises the bow and draws the string, with varying alignments for vertical versus slightly canted bow positions.
this is often one fluid motion for shooters of recurves and longbows, which tend to vary from archer to archer.
compound shooters often experience a slight jerk during the drawback, at around the last 1 1⁄2 inches (4 cm), where the draw weight is at its maximum—before relaxing into a comfortable stable full draw position.
the archer draws the string hand towards the face, where it should rest lightly at a fixed anchor point.
this point is consistent from shot to shot, and is usually at the corner of the mouth, on the chin, to the cheek, or to the ear, depending on preferred shooting style.
the archer holds the bow arm outwards, toward the target.
the elbow of this arm should be rotated so that the inner elbow is perpendicular to the ground, though archers with hyper extendable elbows tend to angle the inner elbow toward the ground, as exemplified by the korean archer jang yong-ho.
this keeps the forearm out of the way of the bowstring.
in modern form, the archer stands erect, forming a "t".
the archer's lower trapezius muscles are used to pull the arrow to the anchor point.
some modern recurve bows are equipped with a mechanical device, called a clicker, which produces a clicking sound when the archer reaches the correct draw length.
in contrast, traditional english longbow shooters step "into the bow", exerting force with both the bow arm and the string hand arm simultaneously, especially when using bows having draw weights from 100 lb (45 kg) to over 175 lb (80 kg).
heavily stacked traditional bows (recurves, long bows, and the like) are released immediately upon reaching full draw at maximum weight, whereas compound bows reach their maximum weight around the last 1 1⁄2 inches (4 cm), dropping holding weight significantly at full draw.
compound bows are often held at full draw for a short time to achieve maximum accuracy.
the arrow is typically released by relaxing the fingers of the drawing hand (see bow draw), or triggering the mechanical release aid.
usually the release aims to keep the drawing arm rigid, the bow hand relaxed, and the arrow is moved back using the back muscles, as opposed to using just arm motions.
an archer should also pay attention to the recoil or follow through of his or her body, as it may indicate problems with form (technique) that affect accuracy.
there are two main forms of aiming in archery: using a mechanical or fixed sight, or barebow.
mechanical sights can be affixed to the bow to aid in aiming.
they can be as simple as a pin, or may use optics with magnification.
they usually also have a peep sight (rear sight) built into the string, which aids in a consistent anchor point.
modern compound bows automatically limit the draw length to give a consistent arrow velocity, while traditional bows allow great variation in draw length.
some bows use mechanical methods to make the draw length consistent.
barebow archers often use a sight picture, which includes the target, the bow, the hand, the arrow shaft and the arrow tip, as seen at the same time by the archer.
with a fixed "anchor point" (where the string is brought to, or close to, the face), and a fully extended bow arm, successive shots taken with the sight picture in the same position fall on the same point.
this lets the archer adjust aim with successive shots to achieve accuracy.
modern archery equipment usually includes sights.
instinctive aiming is used by many archers who use traditional bows.
the two most common forms of a non-mechanical release are split-finger and three-under.
split-finger aiming requires the archer to place the index finger above the nocked arrow, while the middle and ring fingers are both placed below.
three-under aiming places the index, middle, and ring fingers under the nocked arrow.
this technique allows the archer to better look down the arrow since the back of the arrow is closer to the dominant eye, and is commonly called "gun barreling" (referring to common aiming techniques used with firearms).
when using short bows or shooting from horseback, it is difficult to use the sight picture.
the archer may look at the target, but without including the weapon in the field of accurate view.
aiming then involves hand-eye coordination—which includes proprioception and motor-muscle memory, similar to that used when throwing a ball.
with sufficient practice, such archers can normally achieve good practical accuracy for hunting or for war.
aiming without a sight picture may allow more rapid shooting, not however increasing accuracy.
instinctive shooting is a style of shooting that includes the barebow aiming method that relies heavily upon the subconscious mind, proprioception, and motor/muscle memory to make aiming adjustments; the term used to refer to a general category of archers who did not use a mechanical or fixed sight.
when a projectile is thrown by hand, the speed of the projectile is determined by the kinetic energy imparted by the thrower's muscles performing work.
however, the energy must be imparted over a limited distance (determined by arm length) and therefore (because the projectile is accelerating) over a limited time, so the limiting factor is not work but rather power, which determined how much energy can be added in the limited time available.
power generated by muscles, however, is limited by force–velocity relationship, and even at the optimal contraction speed for power production, total work by the muscle is less than half of what it would be if the muscle contracted over the same distance at slow speeds, resulting in less than 1/4 the projectile launch velocity possible without the limitations of the force–velocity relationship.
when a bow is used, the muscles are able to perform work much more slowly, resulting in greater force and greater work done.
this work is stored in the bow as elastic potential energy, and when the bowstring is released, this stored energy is imparted to the arrow much more quickly than can be delivered by the muscles, resulting in much higher velocity and, hence, greater distance.
this same process is employed by frogs, which use elastic tendons to increase jumping distance.
in archery, some energy dissipates through elastic hysteresis, reducing the overall amount released when the bow is shot.
of the remaining energy, some is dampened both by the limbs of the bow and the bowstring.
depending on the arrow's elasticity, some of the energy is also absorbed by compressing the arrow, primarily because the release of the bowstring is rarely in line with the arrow shaft, causing it to flex out to one side.
this is because the bowstring accelerates faster than the archer's fingers can open, and consequently some sideways motion is imparted to the string, and hence arrow nock, as the power and speed of the bow pulls the string off the opening fingers.
even with a release aid mechanism some of this effect is usually experienced, since the string always accelerates faster than the retaining part of the mechanism.
this makes the arrow oscillate in flight—its center flexing to one side and then the other repeatedly, gradually reducing as the arrow's flight proceeds.
this is clearly visible in high-speed photography of arrows at discharge.
a direct effect of these energy transfers can clearly be seen when dry firing.
dry firing refers to releasing the bowstring without a nocked arrow.
because there is no arrow to receive the stored potential energy, almost all the energy stays in the bow.
some have suggested that dry firing may cause physical damage to the bow, such as cracks and fractures—and because most bows are not specifically made to handle the high amounts of energy dry firing produces, should never be done.
modern arrows are made to a specified 'spine', or stiffness rating, to maintain matched flexing and hence accuracy of aim.
this flexing can be a desirable feature, since, when the spine of the shaft is matched to the acceleration of the bow(string), the arrow bends or flexes around the bow and any arrow-rest, and consequently the arrow, and fletchings, have an un-impeded flight.
this feature is known as the archer's paradox.
it maintains accuracy, for if part of the arrow struck a glancing blow on discharge, some inconsistency would be present, and the excellent accuracy of modern equipment would not be achieved.
the accurate flight of an arrow depends on its fletchings.
the arrow's manufacturer (a "fletcher") can arrange fletching to cause the arrow to rotate along its axis.
this improves accuracy by evening pressure buildups that would otherwise cause the arrow to "plane" on the air in a random direction after shooting.
even with a carefully made arrow, the slightest imperfection or air movement causes some unbalanced turbulence in air flow.
consequently, rotation creates an equalization of such turbulence, which, overall, maintains the intended direction of flight i.e.
accuracy.
this rotation is not to be confused with the rapid gyroscopic rotation of a rifle bullet.
fletching that is not arranged to induce rotation still improves accuracy by causing a restoring drag any time the arrow tilts from its intended direction of travel.
the innovative aspect of the invention of the bow and arrow was the amount of power delivered to an extremely small area by the arrow.
the huge ratio of length vs. cross sectional area, coupled with velocity, made the arrow more powerful than any other hand held weapon until firearms were invented.
arrows can spread or concentrate force, depending on the application.
practice arrows, for instance, have a blunt tip that spreads the force over a wider area to reduce the risk of injury or limit penetration.
arrows designed to pierce armor in the middle ages used a very narrow and sharp tip ("bodkinhead") to concentrate the force.
arrows used for hunting used a narrow tip ("broadhead") that widens further, to facilitate both penetration and a large wound.
using archery to take game animals is known as "bow hunting".
bow hunting differs markedly from hunting with firearms, as distance between hunter and prey must be much shorter to ensure a humane kill.
the skills and practices of bow hunting therefore emphasize very close approach to the prey, whether by still hunting, stalking, or waiting in a blind or tree stand.
in many countries, including much of the united states, bow hunting for large and small game is legal.
bow hunters generally enjoy longer seasons than are allowed with other forms of hunting such as black powder, shotgun, or rifle.
usually, compound bows are used for large game hunting due to the relatively short time it takes to master them as opposed to the longbow or recurve bow.
these compound bows may feature fiber optic sights, stabilizers, and other accessories designed to increase accuracy at longer distances.
using a bow and arrow to take fish is known as "bow fishing".
competitive archery involves shooting arrows at a target for accuracy from a set distance or distances.
this is the most popular form of competitive archery worldwide and is called target archery.
a form particularly popular in europe and america is field archery, shot at targets generally set at various distances in a wooded setting.
competitive archery in the united states is governed by usa archery and national field archery association (nfaa), which also certifies instructors.
para-archery is an adaptation of archery for athletes with a disability governed by the world archery federation (wa), and is one of the sports in the summer paralympic games.
there are also several other lesser-known and historical forms of archery, as well as archery novelty games and flight archery, where the aim is to shoot the greatest distance.

benito pablo juárez garcía (spanish: [beˈnito ˈpaβlo ˈxwaɾes gaɾˈsi.a] (listen); 21 march 1806 – 18 july 1872) was a mexican lawyer and politician, who served as the 26th president of mexico from 1858 until his death in 1872. born in oaxaca to a poor rural family of zapotec origin, he became a well-educated urban professional and politician who married a socially prominent woman of oaxaca city, margarita maza.
he identified primarily as a liberal and wrote only briefly about his indigenous heritage.
when moderate liberal president ignacio comonfort was forced to resign by the conservatives in 1858, juárez, as head of the supreme court, assumed the presidency following the succession codified in the constitution of 1857. he weathered the war of the reform (1858–60), a civil war between the liberals and the conservatives, and then the french invasion (1862–1867), which was supported by conservative monarchists.
never relinquishing office although forced into exile to areas of mexico not controlled by the french, juárez tied liberalism to mexican nationalism and maintained that he was the legitimate head of the mexican state, rather than emperor maximilian.
when the french-backed second mexican empire fell in 1867, the mexican republic with juárez as president was restored to full power.
for his success in ousting the european incursion, latin americans considered his time in power as a "second struggle for independence, a second defeat for the european powers, and a second reversal of the conquest."
juárez is revered in mexico as "a preeminent symbol of mexican nationalism and resistance to foreign intervention."
juárez was a practical and skilled politician, controversial in his lifetime and beyond.
he had an understanding of the importance of a working relationship with the united states, and secured its recognition for his liberal government during the war of the reform.
although many of his positions shifted during his political life, he held fast to particular principles including the supremacy of civil power over the catholic church and part of the military; respect for law; and the de-personalization of political life.
in his lifetime he sought to strengthen the national government and asserted the supremacy of central power over states, a position that both radical and provincial liberals opposed.
he was the subject of polemical attacks both in his lifetime and beyond.
however, the place of juárez in mexican historical memory has enshrined him as a major mexican hero, beginning in his own lifetime.
his birthday (march 21) is a national public and patriotic holiday in mexico.
he is the only individual mexican so honored.
juárez was born on 21 march 1806, in a small adobe house in san pablo guelatao, oaxaca, located in the mountain range now known as the sierra juárez.
his parents, brígida garcía and marcelino juárez, were zapotec peasants and died of complications of diabetes when he was three years old.
shortly afterward, his grandparents died as well, so after that his uncle raised him.
he described his parents as "indios de la raza primitiva del país," that is, "indians of the original race of the country."
he worked in the cornfields and as a shepherd until the age of 12, when he walked to the city of oaxaca to attend school.
at the time, he could speak only zapotec.
in the city, where his sister worked as a cook, he took a job as a domestic servant for antonio maza.
his formal education began when a lay franciscan and bookbinder, antonio salanueva, was impressed by juárez's intelligence and desire for learning.
salanueva arranged for his placement at the city's seminary so that he could train to become a priest.
his earlier education was rudimentary, but he began studying latin, completing the secondary curriculum too young to be ordained.
juárez had no calling to become a priest and began studying law at the institute of sciences and arts, founded in 1827 in the state capital.
it was a center of liberal intellectual life in oaxaca and juárez graduated from it in 1834.  even prior to his graduation, he sought political office, and was elected to the oaxaca city council in 1831. in 1841, he was appointed a civil judge.
in 1843, when he was in his late 30s, juárez married margarita maza, the daughter of his sister's patron.
the family was of european origin and part of oaxaca's upper-class society.
with the marriage juárez gained social standing.
margarita maza accepted his proposal and said of juárez, "he is very homely, but very good."
their ethnically mixed marriage was historically unusual, but not often noted in standard biographies.
however, enrique krauze notes: "in this uncommon instance, a white woman had been conquered by an indian, not a native woman by a spaniard."
their marriage lasted until her death from cancer in 1871. juárez and maza had twelve children together, five of whom died in early childhood; juárez also fathered two children with juana rosa chagoya before he married, tereso, who was close to juárez during his expatriations and fought in the reform war, and susana, who was adopted and attended her step-mother's death.
his wife's remains are buried in the juárez mausoleum in mexico city.
juárez's experiences in political life in oaxaca were crucial to his later success as a leader.
his political affiliation with liberalism developed at the institute of arts and science and his ability to rise in oaxaca state politics was due to the lack of an entrenched political class of criollos, mexicans of european descent.
the relative openness of the system allowed him and other newcomers to enter politics and gain patronage.
he developed a political base and gained an understanding of political maneuvering.
following juárez's graduation as a lawyer in 1834 and service as a civil judge in 1841, he became part of the oaxaca state government, led by liberal governor antonio león (1841–1845).
he became a prosecutor in the oaxaca state court and was then elected to the state legislature in 1845. juárez was subsequently elected to the federal legislature, where he supported valentín gómez farías, who instigated liberal reforms including limitations on the power of the catholic church.
with the return to the presidency of antonio lópez de santa anna in 1847, juárez returned to oaxaca.
he was elected governor of the state of oaxaca from 1847 to 1852. during his tenure as governor, he supported the war effort against the u.s. in the mexican–american war, but seeing the war was lost, he refused antonio lópez de santa anna's request to regroup and raise new forces.
this, as well as his objections to the corrupt military dictatorship of santa anna, led to his exile to new orleans in 1853, where he worked in a cigar factory.
other santa anna opponents were also in exile there, including melchor ocampo of michoacan, who was fiercely anticlerical.
in 1854, juárez helped draft the liberals' plan of ayutla, a document calling for santa anna's being deposed from power and the calling of a convention to draft a new constitution.
faced with growing opposition, santa anna was forced to resign in 1855.
with santa anna's resignation, juárez had returned to mexico and became part of the activist liberales (liberals).
a provisional government was formed under general juan álvarez, inaugurating the period known as la reforma, or liberal reform.
juárez served as minister of justice and ecclesiastical affairs, and it was during this time that juárez drafted the law named after him, the juárez law, which declared all citizens equal before the law and restricted the privileges (fueros) of the catholic church and the mexican army.
president álvarez signed the draft into law in 1855. the reform laws sponsored by the puro (pure) wing of the liberal party curtailed the power of the catholic church, confiscating church land, and restricting the military, while trying to create a modern civil society and capitalist economy based on the model of the united states.
the ley juárez was subsequently incorporated into the mexican constitution of 1857, but juárez had no role in that document's drafting, since he had returned to oaxaca where he served again as governor.
the new liberal constitution of 1857 was promulgated and the new president, ignacio comonfort, appointed juárez as minister of government in november 1857. he was then elected president of the supreme court of justice, an office that virtually put its holder as the successor to the president of the republic.
conservatives led by general félix maría zuloaga, with the backing of the military and the clergy and under the slogan religión y fueros (religion and privilege), launched a revolt under the plan of tacubaya on 17 december 1857. comonfort sought to placate the rebels by appointing several conservatives to the cabinet, dissolving the congress, and implementing most of the tacubaya plan.
juárez, ignacio olvera, and many other liberal deputies and ministers were arrested.
the actions did not go far enough for the rebels, and on 11 january 1858, zuloaga demanded comonfort's resignation.
comonfort then re-established the congress, liberated all prisoners and then resigned as president.
the conservative forces proclaimed zuloaga as president on 21 january.
meanwhile, under the terms of the 1857 constitution, the president of the supreme court of justice became interim president of mexico until a new election could be held.
juárez was thus acknowledged as president by liberals on 15 january 1858 and assumed leadership of the liberal side of the civil war known as the reform war (guerra de reforma), (1858–60).
as zuloaga's men were in control of mexico city, juárez and his government fled, first to querétaro and later to veracruz, whose customs revenues were used to fund the government's expenditure.
on may 4, 1858, juárez arrived in veracruz where the government of manuel gutiérrez zamora was stationed with general ignacio de la llave.
his wife and children were waiting for his arrival on the dock of the veracruz’s port, along with a large part of the population that had flooded the pier to greet him.
there, juárez lived many months without any unexpected occurrences until miguel miramón’s attack who finally found and moved toward the port on march 30, 1859. on april 6th, juárez received a diplomatic representative of the united states government: robert milligan mclane.
following this visit, a treaty between the us and juárez's government, the mclane-ocampo treaty, was signed in december 1859, although president james buchanan was unable to secure ratification of the treaty by the us congress.
nevertheless, the aid received enabled the liberals to overcome the conservatives' initial military advantage; juárez's government successfully defended veracruz from assault twice during 1860 and recaptured mexico city on 1 january 1861.
on july 12 of 1859, juárez decreed the first regulations of the “law of nationalization of the ecclesiastical wealth.” this enactment prohibited the catholic church from having properties in mexico.
because of juárez's law of nationalization, the catholic church and the regular army supported the conservatives in the reform war.
on the other hand, the liberals had the support of several state governments in the north and central-west of the country, as well as that of buchanan's government.
due to the initial weakness of the juárez administration, conservatives félix maría zuloaga and leonardo márquez had the opportunity to reclaim power.
to resolve this, juárez petitioned congress to be given emergency powers.
the liberal members of congress denied the petition with the main argument being that the country was under a current constitutional government that had been achieved only through a very bloody civil war.
it was not consistent for juárez, who had implemented that constitution, now to wish to violate the legal functions of the constitution by giving himself dictatorial powers.
however, after two groups of conservatives ambushed and killed ocampo and later santos degollado in 1861, the liberals were outraged and juárez took "extreme measures" to deal with the conservatives.
after the scandal of ocampo's murder, the liberal-majority congress gave juárez the money and power that he needed to finish off the conservatives.
juárez had excellent finances during his administration.
his government achieved a budget deficit of 400,000 pesos every month.
however, he was only able to collect one million pesos by selling church lands.
after the defeat of the conservatives on the battlefield, in march 1861 elections were held with juárez elected president in his own right under the constitution of 1857. however, the liberals' celebrations of 1861 were short-lived.
the war had severely damaged mexico's infrastructure and crippled its economy.
even though the conservatives had been defeated, they would not disappear, and the juárez government had to respond to pressures from these factions.
he was forced to grant amnesty to captured conservative guerrillas still resisting the juárez government, even though they had executed captured liberals, including melchor ocampo and santos degollado.
in the wake of the civil war and the demobilization of combatants, juárez established the rural guard or rurales, aimed at bringing public security, particularly as banditry and rural unrest grew.
many brigands and bandits had allied themselves with the liberal cause during the civil war.
with that conflict concluded, many became guerrillas and bandits again, when the government jobs they demanded as rewards for their services to the republic were not forthcoming.
juárez's minister of the interior, francisco zarco, oversaw the founding of the rurales.
the creation of the police force controlled by the president was done quietly because it violated federalist principles of traditional liberalism, which gave little power to the central government and much to mexican states.
the force's creation was an indication that juárez was becoming more of a centralist as he confronted rural unrest.
as a pragmatic solution, the force consisted of former bandits converted into policemen.
juárez's government also faced international dangers.
in view of the government's desperate financial straits, juárez canceled repayments of interest on foreign loans that had been taken out by the defeated conservatives.
spain, britain and france, angry over unpaid mexican debts, sent a joint expeditionary force that seized the veracruz customs house in december 1861. spain and britain soon withdrew after they realized that the french emperor napoleon iii intended to overthrow the juárez government and establish a second mexican empire, with the support of the remnants of the conservative side in the reform war.
thus began the french invasion in 1862 and the outbreak of an even longer war, with liberals attempting to oust the foreign invaders and their conservative allies and save the republic.
although republican forces under ignacio zaragoza won an initial victory over the monarchists on 5 may 1862, the battle of puebla, celebrated annually as cinco de mayo, forcing the french to retreat to the coast for a year, the french advanced again in 1863, and captured mexico city.
juárez and his elected government fled the capital and became a government in exile, with little power or territorial control.
juárez headed north, first to san luis potosí, then to the arid northern city of el paso del norte, present day ciudad juárez, chihuahua, and finally to the capital of the state, chihuahua city, where he set up his cabinet.
there, he would remain for the next two and a half years.
meanwhile, maximilian von habsburg, younger brother of habsburg emperor franz joseph of austria, was proclaimed emperor as maximilian i of mexico on 20 april 1864 with the backing of napoleon iii and a group of mexican conservatives.
before juárez fled, congress granted him an emergency extension of his presidency, which would go into effect in 1865, when his term expired, and would last until 1867, when the last of maximilian's forces were defeated.
in response to the french invasion and the elevation of maximilian as emperor of mexico with the support of mexican conservatives, juárez sent general plácido vega y daza to california to gather mexican american sympathy for the plight of republican mexico.
maximilian offered juárez amnesty and later even the post of prime minister, but juárez refused to accept a government "imposed by foreigners" or a monarchy.
the government of the united states was sympathetic to juárez, refusing to recognize maximilian and opposing the french invasion as a violation of the monroe doctrine, but its attention was entirely taken up by the american civil war.
juárez's wife, margarita maza, and their children spent the invasion in exile in new york where she met several times with u.s. president abraham lincoln, who received her as the first lady of mexico.
although much has been made of a connection between juárez and abraham lincoln, as two presidents who shared humble social origins, a law career, a rapidly-ascending political career in their home states, and a presidency that began under the auspices of a civil war that made long-lasting reform a necessity, they never met nor exchanged correspondence.
following the end of the war, u.s. president andrew johnson demanded the french evacuate mexico and imposed a naval blockade in february 1866.
when johnson could get no support in congress, he allegedly had the army "lose" some supplies (including rifles) "near" (across) the border with mexico, according to u.s. general philip sheridan's journal account.
[page needed] in his memoirs, sheridan stated that he had supplied arms and ammunition to juárez's forces: "... which we left at convenient places on our side of the river to fall into their hands".
faced with us opposition to a french presence and a growing threat on the european mainland from prussia, french troops began pulling out of mexico in late 1866. maximilian's actually liberal views cost him support from mexican conservatives as well.
in 1867, the last of the emperor's forces were defeated and maximilian was sentenced to death by a military court, a retaliation for maximilian's earlier orders for the execution of republican soldiers (although some historians point to the fact that the original "black decree" was from juárez – who had people executed, without trial, for "helping" his enemies, whereas maximilian often pardoned people who had actually fought against him).
despite national and international pleas for amnesty, juárez refused to commute the sentence, and maximilian was executed by firing squad on 19 june 1867 at cerro de las campanas in querétaro.
his last words had been "¡viva méxico!".
his body was returned to vienna for burial.
the period following the expulsion of the french and up to the revolt of porfirio díaz in 1876 are now commonly known in mexico as the "restored republic".
the period includes the last years of the juárez presidency and following his death in 1872, that of sebastián lerdo de tejada.
juárez did not leave power following the end of the french invasion.
he won in a relatively clean manner the 1867 election and immediately requested and obtained special powers from congress to rule by decree.
despite being forbidden to do so by the 1857 constitution, juárez once again ran for re-election in 1871.
he began instituting major reforms that had constitutional force because of the constitution of 1857 that could not be implemented due to the war of the reform 1858–1860, and the french intervention (1862–67).
one such reform was in education.
an elite preparatory school was founded in mexico city in 1868, the national preparatory school.
amid fraud charges and widespread controversy, he was re-elected for a new term in 1871. during his last two terms, he used the office of the presidency to ensure electoral success, obtain personal gains and suppress revolts by opponents, such as porfirio díaz.
on february 7, 1866, juarez was elected as a companion of the third class (i.e.
honorary member) of the pennsylvania commandery of the military order of the loyal legion of the united states (mollus).
mollus is a hereditary military society originally composed of officers who served in the union armed forces during the american civil war and now composed of their descedants.
juarez was one of the very few foreigners to be elected to membership in the order.
he was assigned mollus insignia number 156.
juárez died of a heart attack on july 18, 1872, while reading a newspaper at his desk in the national palace in mexico city, aged 66. he was succeeded by sebastián lerdo de tejada, the head of the supreme court and a close political ally.
today benito juárez is remembered as being a progressive reformer dedicated to democracy, equal rights for his nation's indigenous peoples, his antipathy toward organized religion, especially the catholic church, and what he regarded as defense of national sovereignty.
the period of his leadership is known in mexican history as la reforma del norte (the reform of the north), and constituted a liberal political and social revolution with major institutional consequences: the expropriation of church lands, the subordination of the army to civilian control, liquidation of peasant communal land holdings, the separation of church and state in public affairs, and also the almost-complete disenfranchisement of bishops, priests, nuns and lay brothers, codified in the "juárez law" or "ley juárez".
la reforma represented the triumph of mexico's liberal, federalist, anti-clerical, and pro-capitalist forces over the conservative, centralist, corporatist, and theocratic elements that sought to reconstitute a locally-run version of the old colonial system.
it replaced a semi-feudal social system with a more market-driven one, but following juárez's death, the lack of adequate democratic and institutional stability soon led to a return to centralized autocracy and economic exploitation under the regime of porfirio díaz.
the porfiriato (1876–1911), in turn, collapsed at the beginning of the mexican revolution.
juárez complex national palace
in the national palace in mexico city, where he lived while in power, there is a small museum in his honour.
one can see the furniture and objects he used.
sala, comedor, estudio y alcoba de don benito juárez.
juárez's famous quote continues to be well-remembered in mexico: "entre los individuos, como entre las naciones, el respeto al derecho ajeno es la paz", meaning "among individuals, as among nations, respect for the rights of others is peace".
the portion of this motto in bold is inscribed on the coat of arms of oaxaca.
it is quoted in truncated form in stone on the juárez statue in bryant park in new york city, "respect for the rights of others is peace."
this quote summarizes mexico's stances towards foreign affairs.
another famous quote:  "la ley ha sido siempre mi espada y mi escudo", or "the law has always been my shield and my sword", is a phrase often reproduced as decoration inside court and tribunals buildings.
john fitzgerald kennedy (may 29, 1917 – november 22, 1963), often referred to by his initials jfk and jack, was an american politician who served as the 35th president of the united states from january 1961 until his assassination in november 1963. kennedy served at the height of the cold war, and the majority of his work as president concerned relations with the soviet union and cuba.
a democrat, kennedy represented massachusetts in the u.s. house of representatives and senate prior to becoming president.
kennedy was born into a wealthy political family in brookline, massachusetts.
he graduated from harvard university in 1940, before joining the u.s. naval reserve the following year.
during world war ii, he commanded a series of pt boats in the pacific theater and earned the navy and marine corps medal for his service.
after the war, kennedy represented the massachusetts's 11th congressional district in the u.s. house of representatives from 1947 to 1953. he was subsequently elected to the u.s. senate and served as the junior senator from massachusetts from 1953 to 1960. while in the senate, kennedy published his book, profiles in courage, which won a pulitzer prize.
in the 1960 presidential election, he narrowly defeated republican opponent richard nixon, who was the incumbent vice president.
kennedy's administration included high tensions with communist states in the cold war.
as a result, he increased the number of american military advisers in south vietnam.
in april 1961, he authorized an attempt to overthrow the cuban government of fidel castro in the bay of pigs invasion.
kennedy authorized the cuban project in november 1961. he rejected operation northwoods (plans for false flag attacks to gain approval for a war against cuba) in march 1962. however, his administration continued to plan for an invasion of cuba in the summer of 1962. the following october, u.s. spy planes discovered soviet missile bases had been deployed in cuba; the resulting period of tensions, termed the cuban missile crisis, nearly resulted in the breakout of a global thermonuclear conflict.
the strategic hamlet program began in vietnam during his presidency.
domestically, kennedy presided over the establishment of the peace corps and the continuation of the apollo space program.
he also supported the civil rights movement, but was only somewhat successful in passing his new frontier domestic policies.
on november 22, 1963, he was assassinated in dallas, texas.
vice president lyndon b. johnson assumed the presidency upon kennedy's death.
marxist and former u.s. marine lee harvey oswald was arrested for the state crime, but he was shot and killed by jack ruby two days later.
the fbi and the warren commission both concluded oswald had acted alone in the assassination, but various groups contested the warren report and believed that kennedy was the victim of a conspiracy.
after kennedy's death, congress enacted many of his proposals, including the civil rights act and the revenue act of 1964. kennedy ranks highly in polls of u.s. presidents with historians and the general public.
his personal life has also been the focus of considerable sustained interest, following public revelations in the 1970s of his chronic health ailments and extramarital affairs.
john fitzgerald kennedy was born on may 29, 1917, at 83 beals street in the boston suburb of brookline, massachusetts, to joseph p. kennedy sr., a businessman and politician, and rose kennedy (née fitzgerald), a philanthropist and socialite.
his paternal grandfather, p. j. kennedy, was a massachusetts state senator.
kennedy's maternal grandfather and namesake, john f. fitzgerald, served as a u.s. congressman and was elected to two terms as mayor of boston.
all four of his grandparents were children of irish immigrants.
kennedy had an elder brother, joseph jr., and seven younger siblings: rosemary, kathleen ("kick"), eunice, patricia, robert ("bobby"), jean, and edward ("ted").
kennedy lived in brookline for the first ten years of his life and attended the local st. aidan's church, where he was baptized on june 19, 1917. he was educated at the edward devotion school in brookline, the noble and greenough lower school in dedham, massachusetts, and the dexter school (also in brookline) through the 4th grade.
his father's business had kept him away from the family for long stretches of time, and his ventures were concentrated on wall street and hollywood.
in september 1927, the family moved from brookline to the riverdale neighborhood of new york city.
young john attended the lower campus of riverdale country school, a private school for boys, from 5th to 7th grade.
two years later, the family moved to suburban bronxville, new york, where kennedy was a member of boy scout troop 2. the family spent summers and early autumns at their home in hyannis port, a village on cape cod, massachusetts; christmas and easter holidays were at their winter retreat in palm beach, florida.
in september 1930, kennedy, then 13 years old, attended the canterbury school in new milford, connecticut, for 8th grade.
in april 1931, he had an appendectomy, after which he withdrew from canterbury and recuperated at home.
in september 1931, kennedy started attending choate, a prestigious boarding school in wallingford, connecticut, for 9th through 12th grade.
his older brother joe jr. had already been at choate for two years and was a football player and leading student.
he spent his first years at choate in his older brother's shadow and compensated with rebellious behavior that attracted a coterie.
they carried out their most notorious stunt by exploding a toilet seat with a powerful firecracker.
in the ensuing chapel assembly, the strict headmaster, george st. john, brandished the toilet seat and spoke of certain "muckers" who would "spit in our sea".
the defiant kennedy took the cue and named his group "the muckers club", which included roommate and lifelong friend kirk lemoyne "lem" billings.
during his years at choate, kennedy was beset by health problems that culminated with his emergency hospitalization in 1934 at yale new haven hospital, where doctors suspected leukemia.
in june 1934, he was admitted to the mayo clinic in rochester, minnesota; the ultimate diagnosis there was colitis.
kennedy graduated from choate in june of the following year, finishing 64th in a class of 112 students.
he had been the business manager of the school yearbook and was voted the "most likely to succeed".
in september 1935, kennedy made his first trip abroad when he traveled to london with his parents and his sister kathleen.
he intended to study under harold laski at the london school of economics (lse), as his older brother had done.
ill-health forced his return to the united states in october of that year, when he enrolled late and attended princeton university but had to leave after two months due to a gastrointestinal illness.
he was then hospitalized for observation at peter bent brigham hospital in boston.
he convalesced further at the family winter home in palm beach, then spent the spring of 1936 working as a ranch hand on the 40,000-acre jay six cattle ranch outside benson, arizona.
it is reported that ranchman jack speiden worked both brothers "very hard".
in september 1936, kennedy enrolled at harvard college, and his application essay stated: "the reasons that i have for wishing to go to harvard are several.
i feel that harvard can give me a better background and a better liberal education than any other university.
i have always wanted to go there, as i have felt that it is not just another college, but is a university with something definite to offer.
then too, i would like to go to the same college as my father.
to be a 'harvard man' is an enviable distinction, and one that i sincerely hope i shall attain."
he produced that year's annual "freshman smoker", called by a reviewer "an elaborate entertainment, which included in its cast outstanding personalities of the radio, screen and sports world".
he tried out for the football, golf, and swimming teams and earned a spot on the varsity swimming team.
kennedy also sailed in the star class and won the 1936 nantucket sound star championship.
in july 1937, kennedy sailed to france—taking his convertible—and spent ten weeks driving through europe with billings.
in june 1938, kennedy sailed overseas with his father and older brother to work at the american embassy in london, where his father was president franklin d. roosevelt's u.s. ambassador to the court of st. james's.
in 1939, kennedy toured europe, the soviet union, the balkans, and the middle east in preparation for his harvard senior honors thesis.
he then went to czechoslovakia and germany before returning to london on september 1, 1939, the day that germany invaded poland to mark the beginning of world war ii.
two days later, the family was in the house of commons for speeches endorsing the united kingdom's declaration of war on germany.
kennedy was sent as his father's representative to help with arrangements for american survivors of the ss athenia before flying back to the u.s. from foynes, ireland, to port washington, new york, on his first transatlantic flight.
when kennedy was an upperclassman at harvard, he began to take his studies more seriously and developed an interest in political philosophy.
he made the dean's list in his junior year.
in 1940 kennedy completed his thesis, "appeasement in munich", about british participation in the munich agreement.
the thesis eventually became a bestseller under the title why england slept.
in addition to addressing britain's failure to strengthen its military in the lead-up to world war ii, the book also called for an anglo-american alliance against the rising totalitarian powers.
kennedy became increasingly supportive of u.s. intervention in world war ii, and his father's isolationist beliefs resulted in the latter's dismissal as ambassador to the united kingdom.
this created a split between the kennedy and roosevelt families.
in 1940, kennedy graduated cum laude from harvard with a bachelor of arts in government, concentrating on international affairs.
that fall, he enrolled at the stanford graduate school of business and audited classes there.
in early 1941, kennedy left and helped his father write a memoir of his time as an american ambassador.
he then traveled throughout south america; his itinerary included colombia, ecuador and peru.
in 1940, kennedy attempted to enter the army's officer candidate school.
despite months of training, he was medically disqualified due to his chronic lower back problems.
on september 24, 1941, kennedy, with the help of then director of the office of naval intelligence (oni) and former naval attaché to joseph kennedy alan kirk, joined the united states naval reserve.
he was commissioned an ensign on october 26, 1941, and joined the staff of the office of naval intelligence in washington, d.c.
in january 1942, kennedy was assigned to the oni field office at headquarters, sixth naval district, in charleston, south carolina.
he attended the naval reserve officer training school at northwestern university in chicago, illinois, from july 27 to september 27  and then voluntarily entered the motor torpedo boat squadrons training center in melville, rhode island.
on october 10, he was promoted to lieutenant junior grade.
in early november, kennedy was still mourning the death of his close, childhood friend, marine corps second lieutenant george houk mead jr., who had been killed in action at guadalcanal that august and awarded the navy cross for his bravery.
accompanied by a female acquaintance from a wealthy newport family, the couple had stopped in middletown, rhode island at the cemetery where the decorated, naval spy, commander hugo w. koehler, usn, had been buried the previous year.
ambling around the plots near the tiny st. columba's chapel, kennedy paused over koehler's white granite cross grave marker and pondered his own mortality, hoping out loud that when his time came, he would not have to die without religion.
"but these things can't be faked," he added.
"there's no bluffing."
two decades later, kennedy and koehler's stepson, u.s. senator claiborne pell had become good friends and political allies, although they had been acquaintances since the mid-1930s during their "salad days" on the same newport debutante party "circuit" and when pell had dated kathleen ("kick") kennedy.
kennedy completed his training on december 2 and was assigned to motor torpedo squadron four.
his first command was pt-101 from december 7, 1942, until february 23, 1943: it was a patrol torpedo (pt) boat used for training while kennedy was an instructor at melville.
he then led three huckins pt boats—pt-98, pt-99, and pt-101, which were being relocated from mtbron 4 in melville, rhode island, back to jacksonville, florida, and the new mtbron 14 (formed february 17, 1943).
during the trip south, he was hospitalized briefly in jacksonville after diving into the cold water to unfoul a propeller.
thereafter, kennedy was assigned duty in panama and later in the pacific theater, where he eventually commanded two more pt boats.
in april 1943, kennedy was assigned to motor torpedo squadron two, and on april 24 he took command of pt-109, which was based at the time on tulagi island in the solomons.
on the night of august 1–2, in support of the new georgia campaign, pt-109 was on its 31st mission with fourteen other pts ordered to block or repel four japanese destroyers and float planes carrying food, supplies, and 900 japanese soldiers to the vila plantation garrison on the southern tip of the solomon's kolombangara island.
intelligence had been sent to kennedy's commander thomas g. warfield expecting the arrival of the large japanese naval force that would pass on the evening of august 1. of the 24 torpedoes fired that night by eight of the american pt's, not one hit the japanese convoy.
on that dark and moonless night, kennedy spotted a japanese destroyer heading north on its return from the base of kolombangara around 2:00 a.m., and attempted to turn to attack, when pt-109 was rammed suddenly at an angle and cut in half by the destroyer amagiri, killing two pt-109 crew members.
kennedy gathered around the wreckage his surviving ten crew members to vote on whether to "fight or surrender".
kennedy stated: "there's nothing in the book about a situation like this.
a lot of you men have families and some of you have children.
what do you want to do?
i have nothing to lose."
shunning surrender, around 2:00 p.m. on august 2, the men swam towards plum pudding island 3.5 miles (5.6 km) southwest of the remains of pt-109.
despite re-injuring his back in the collision, kennedy towed a badly burned crewman through the water to the island with a life jacket strap clenched between his teeth.
kennedy made an additional two-mile swim the night of august 2, 1943, to ferguson passage to attempt to hail a passing american pt boat to expedite his crew's rescue and attempted to make the trip on a subsequent night, in a damaged canoe found on naru island where he had swum with ensign george ross to look for food.
on august 4, 1943, he and lenny thom assisted his injured and hungry crew on a demanding swim 3.75 miles (6.04 km) southeast to olasana island, which was visible to the crew from their desolate home on plum pudding island.
they swam against a strong current, and once again kennedy towed the badly burned motor machinist "pappy" macmahon by his life vest.
the somewhat larger olasana island had ripe coconut trees, but still no fresh water.
on the following day, august 5, kennedy and ensign george ross made the one hour swim to naru island, an additional distance of about .5 miles (0.80 km) southwest, in search of help and food.
kennedy and ross found a small canoe, packages of crackers, candy and a fifty-gallon drum of drinkable water left by the japanese, which kennedy paddled another half mile back to olasana in the acquired canoe to provide his hungry crew.
lieutenant "bud" liebenow, a friend and former tentmate of kennedy's, rescued kennedy and his crew on olasana island on august 8, 1943 aboard his boat, pt-157, with the help of coast watcher lieutenant reginald evans and several native coast watchers, particularly biuku gasa and eroni kumana.
kennedy took only a month to recover and returned to duty, commanding the pt-59, first removing the torpedo tubes and depth charges and refitting her in one month into a heavily armed gunboat mounting two automatic 40mm guns and ten .50 caliber browning machine guns.
the plan was to attach one gunboat to each pt boat section to add gun range and power against barges and shore batteries which the 59 encountered on several occasions in mid-october through mid-november.
on october 8, 1943, kennedy was promoted to full lieutenant.
on november 2, kennedy's pt-59 took part with two other pts in the successful rescue of 40–50 marines.
the 59 acted as a shield from shore fire and protected them as they escaped on two rescue landing craft at the base of the warrior river at choiseul island, taking ten marines aboard and delivering them to safety.
under doctor's orders, kennedy was relieved of his command of pt-59 on november 18, and sent to the hospital on tulagi.
from there he returned to the united states in early january 1944. after receiving treatment for his back injury, he was released from active duty in late 1944.
kennedy was hospitalized at the chelsea naval hospital in chelsea, massachusetts from may to december 1944. on june 12, he was presented the navy and marine corps medal for his heroic actions on august 1–2, 1943, and the purple heart medal for his back injury while on pt-109.
beginning in january 1945, kennedy spent three more months recovering from his back injury at castle hot springs, a resort and temporary military hospital in arizona.
after the war, kennedy felt that the medal he had received for heroism was not a combat award and asked that he be reconsidered for the silver star medal for which he had been recommended initially.
kennedy's father also requested that his son receive the silver star, which is awarded for gallantry in action.
on august 12, 1944, kennedy's older brother, joe jr., a navy pilot, was killed while volunteering for a special and hazardous air mission.
his explosive-laden plane blew up when the plane's bombs detonated prematurely while the aircraft was flying over the english channel.
on march 1, 1945, kennedy retired from the navy reserve on physical disability and was honorably discharged with the full rank of lieutenant.
when later asked how he became a war hero, kennedy joked: "it was easy.
they cut my pt boat in half."
in 1950, the department of the navy offered kennedy a bronze star medal in recognition of his meritorious service, which he declined.
kennedy's two original medals are currently on display at the john f. kennedy presidential library and museum.
kennedy's military decorations and awards include the navy and marine corps medal; purple heart medal; american defense service medal; american campaign medal; asiatic-pacific campaign medal with three ​3⁄16" bronze stars; and the world war ii victory medal.
for extremely heroic conduct as commanding officer of motor torpedo boat 109 following the collision and sinking of that vessel in the pacific war area on august 1–2, 1943. unmindful of personal danger, lieutenant (then lieutenant, junior grade) kennedy unhesitatingly braved the difficulties and hazards of darkness to direct rescue operations, swimming many hours to secure aid and food after he had succeeded in getting his crew ashore.
his outstanding courage, endurance and leadership contributed to the saving of several lives and were in keeping with the highest traditions of the united states naval service.
in april 1945, kennedy's father, who was a friend of william randolph hearst, arranged a position for his son as a special correspondent for hearst newspapers; the assignment kept kennedy's name in the public eye and "expose[d] him to journalism as a possible career".
he worked as a correspondent that may, covering the potsdam conference and other events.
jfk's elder brother joe had been the family's political standard-bearer and had been tapped by their father to seek the presidency.
joe's death during the war in 1944 changed that course and the assignment fell to jfk as the second eldest of the kennedy siblings.
at the urging of kennedy's father, u.s. representative james michael curley vacated his seat in the strongly democratic 11th congressional district of massachusetts to become mayor of boston in 1946. kennedy established his residency at an apartment building on 122 bowdoin street across from the massachusetts state house.
with his father financing and running his campaign under the slogan "the new generation offers a leader", kennedy won the democratic primary with 12 percent of the vote, defeating ten other candidates.
campaigning around boston, kennedy called for better housing for veterans, better health care for all, and support for organized labor's campaign for reasonable work hours, a healthy workplace, and the right to organize, bargain, and strike.
in addition, he campaigned for peace through the united nations and strong opposition to the soviet union.
though republicans took control of the house in the 1946 elections, kennedy defeated his republican opponent in the general election, taking 73 percent of the vote.
along with richard nixon and joseph mccarthy, kennedy was one of several world war ii veterans elected to congress that year.
he served in the house for six years, joining the influential education and labor committee and the veterans' affairs committee.
he concentrated his attention on international affairs, supporting the truman doctrine as the appropriate response to the emerging cold war.
he also supported public housing and opposed the labor management relations act of 1947, which restricted the power of labor unions.
though not as vocal an anti-communist as mccarthy, kennedy supported the immigration and nationality act of 1952, which required communists to register with the government, and he deplored the "loss of china".
having served as a boy scout during his childhood, kennedy was active in the boston council from 1946 to 1955: as district vice chairman, member of the executive board, vice-president, as well as a national council representative.
almost every weekend that congress was in session, kennedy would fly back to massachusetts to give speeches to veteran, fraternal, and civic groups, while maintaining an index card file on individuals who might be helpful for a future campaign for state-wide office.
jfk set a goal of speaking in every city and town in massachusetts prior to 1952.
as early as 1949, kennedy began preparing to run for the senate in 1952 against republican three-term incumbent henry cabot lodge jr. with the campaign slogan "kennedy will do more for massachusetts".
joseph kennedy again financed and managed his son's candidacy, while john kennedy's younger brother robert kennedy emerged as an important member of the campaign.
in the presidential election, republican dwight d. eisenhower carried massachusetts by a margin of 208,000 votes, but kennedy defeated lodge by 70,000 votes for the senate seat.
the following year, he married jacqueline bouvier.
kennedy underwent several spinal operations over the next two years.
often absent from the senate, he was at times critically ill and received catholic last rites.
during his convalescence in 1956, he published profiles in courage, a book about u.s. senators who risked their careers for their personal beliefs, for which he won the pulitzer prize for biography in 1957. rumors that this work was co-written by his close adviser and speechwriter, ted sorensen, were confirmed in sorensen's 2008 autobiography.
at the start of his first term, kennedy focused on massachusetts-specific issues by sponsoring bills to help the fishing, textile manufacturing, and watchmaking industries.
in 1954, senator kennedy voted in favor of the saint lawrence seaway which would connect the great lakes to the atlantic ocean, despite opposition from massachusetts politicians who argued that the project would cripple new england's shipping industry, including the port of boston.
three years later, kennedy chaired a special committee to select the five greatest u.s. senators in history so their portraits could decorate the senate reception room.
that same year, kennedy joined the senate labor rackets committee with his brother robert (who was chief counsel) to investigate crime infiltration of labor unions.
in 1958, kennedy introduced a bill (s. 3974) which became the first major labor relations bill to pass either house since the taft-hartley act of 1947. the bill dealt largely with the control of union abuses exposed by the mcclellan committee but did not incorporate tough taft-hartley amendments requested by president eisenhower.
it survived senate floor attempts to include taft-hartley amendments and gained passage but was rejected by the house.
at the 1956 democratic national convention, kennedy gave the nominating speech for the party's presidential nominee, adlai stevenson ii.
stevenson let the convention select the vice presidential nominee.
kennedy finished second in the balloting, losing to senator estes kefauver of tennessee but receiving national exposure as a result.
one of the matters demanding kennedy's attention in the senate was president eisenhower's bill for the civil rights act of 1957. kennedy cast a procedural vote against it, considered by some as an appeasement of southern democratic opponents of the bill.
kennedy did vote for title iii of the act, which would have given the attorney general powers to enjoin, but majority leader lyndon b. johnson agreed to let the provision die as a compromise measure.
kennedy also voted for title iv, termed the "jury trial amendment".
many civil rights advocates at the time criticized that vote as one which would weaken the act.
a final compromise bill, which kennedy supported, was passed in september 1957. he proposed july 2, 1957 that the u.s. support algeria's effort to gain independence from france.
the following year, kennedy authored a nation of immigrants (later published in 1964), which analyzed the importance of immigration in the country's history as well as proposals to re-evaluate immigration law.
in 1958, kennedy was re-elected to a second term in the senate, defeating republican opponent, boston lawyer vincent j. celeste, by a margin of 874,608 votes, the largest margin in the history of massachusetts politics.
it was during his re-election campaign that kennedy's press secretary at the time, robert e. thompson, put together a film entitled the u.s. senator john f. kennedy story, which exhibited a day in the life of the senator and showcased his family life as well as the inner workings of his office to solve massachusetts-related issues.
it was the most comprehensive film produced about kennedy up to that time.
in the aftermath of his re-election, kennedy began preparing to run for president by traveling throughout the u.s. with the aim of building his candidacy for 1960.
when it came to conservation, kennedy, a massachusetts audubon society supporter, wanted to make sure that the shorelines of cape cod remained unsullied by future industrialization.
on september 3, 1959, kennedy cosponsored the cape cod national seashore bill with his republican colleague senator leverett saltonstall.
kennedy's father was a strong supporter and friend of senator joseph mccarthy.
additionally, bobby kennedy worked for mccarthy's subcommittee, and mccarthy dated kennedy's sister patricia.
in 1954, the senate voted to censure mccarthy, and kennedy drafted a speech supporting the censure.
however, it was not delivered because kennedy was hospitalized at the time.
the speech put kennedy in the apparent position of participating by "pairing" his vote against that of another senator, and opposing the censure.
although kennedy never indicated how he would have voted, the episode damaged his support among members of the liberal community, including eleanor roosevelt, in the 1956 and 1960 elections.
on december 17, 1959, a letter from kennedy's staff that was to be sent to "active and influential democrats" was leaked stating that he would announce his presidential campaign on january 2, 1960. on january 2, 1960, kennedy announced his candidacy for the democratic presidential nomination.
though some questioned kennedy's age and experience, his charisma and eloquence earned him numerous supporters.
many americans held anti-catholic attitudes, but kennedy's vocal support of the separation of church and state helped defuse the situation.
his religion also helped him win a devoted following among many catholic voters.
kennedy faced several potential challengers for the democratic nomination, including senate majority leader lyndon b. johnson, adlai stevenson ii, and senator hubert humphrey.
kennedy's presidential campaign was a family affair, funded by his father and with his younger brother robert, acting as his campaign manager.
john preferred ivy league policy advisors, but unlike his father he enjoyed the give and take of massachusetts politics and built a largely irish team of campaigners, headed by larry o'brien and kenneth o'donnell.
kennedy traveled extensively to build his support among democratic elites and voters.
at the time, party officials controlled most of the delegates, but several states also held primaries, and kennedy sought to win several primaries to boost his chances of winning the nomination.
in his first major test, kennedy won the wisconsin primary, effectively ending humphrey's hopes of winning the presidency.
nonetheless, kennedy and humphrey faced each other in a competitive west virginia primary in which kennedy could not benefit from a catholic bloc, as he had in wisconsin.
kennedy won the west virginia primary, impressing many in the party, but at the start of the 1960 democratic national convention, it was unclear as to whether he would win the nomination.
when kennedy entered the convention, he had the most delegates, but not enough to ensure that he would win the nomination.
stevenson—the 1952 and 1956 presidential nominee—remained very popular in the party, while johnson also hoped to win the nomination with the support from party leaders.
kennedy's candidacy also faced opposition from former president harry s. truman, who was concerned about kennedy's lack of experience.
kennedy knew that a second ballot could give the nomination to johnson or someone else, and his well-organized campaign was able to earn the support of just enough delegates to win the presidential nomination on the first ballot.
kennedy ignored the opposition of his brother, who wanted him to choose labor leader walter reuther, and other liberal supporters when he chose johnson as his vice presidential nominee.
he believed that the texas senator could help him win support from the south.
the choice infuriated many in labor.
afl-cio president george meany called johnson "the arch foe of labor," while illinois afl-cio president reuben soderstrom asserted kennedy had "made chumps out of leaders of the american labor movement."
in accepting the presidential nomination, kennedy gave his well-known "new frontier" speech, saying, "for the problems are not all solved and the battles are not all won—and we stand today on the edge of a new frontier.
... but the new frontier of which i speak is not a set of promises—it is a set of challenges.
it sums up not what i intend to offer the american people, but what i intend to ask of them."
at the start of the fall general election campaign, republican nominee and incumbent vice president richard nixon held a six-point lead in the polls.
major issues included how to get the economy moving again, kennedy's roman catholicism, the cuban revolution, and whether the space and missile programs of the soviet union had surpassed those of the u.s. to address fears that his being catholic would impact his decision-making, he famously told the greater houston ministerial association on september 12, 1960: "i am not the catholic candidate for president.
i am the democratic party candidate for president who also happens to be a catholic.
i do not speak for my church on public matters—and the church does not speak for me."
kennedy questioned rhetorically whether one-quarter of americans were relegated to second-class citizenship just because they were catholic, and once stated that "[n]o one asked me my religion [serving the navy] in the south pacific".
between september and october, kennedy squared off against nixon in the first televised presidential debates in u.s. history.
during these programs, nixon had an injured leg, "five o'clock shadow", and was perspiring, making him look tense and uncomfortable.
conversely, kennedy wore makeup and appeared relaxed, which helped the large television audience to view him as the winner.
on average radio listeners thought that nixon had won or that the debates were a draw.
the debates are now considered a milestone in american political history—the point at which the medium of television began to play a dominant role in politics.
kennedy's campaign gained momentum after the first debate, and he pulled slightly ahead of nixon in most polls.
on election day, kennedy defeated nixon in one of the closest presidential elections of the 20th century.
in the national popular vote, by most accounts, kennedy led nixon by just two-tenths of one percent (49.7% to 49.5%), while in the electoral college, he won 303 votes to nixon's 219 (269 were needed to win).
fourteen electors from mississippi and alabama refused to support kennedy because of his support for the civil rights movement; they voted for senator harry f. byrd of virginia, as did an elector from oklahoma.
kennedy became the youngest person (43) ever elected to the presidency, though theodore roosevelt was a year younger at 42 when he automatically assumed the office after william mckinley's assassination in 1901.
john f. kennedy was sworn in as the 35th president at noon on january 20, 1961. in his inaugural address, he spoke of the need for all americans to be active citizens, famously saying, "ask not what your country can do for you.
ask what you can do for your country."
he asked the nations of the world to join together to fight what he called the "common enemies of man: tyranny, poverty, disease, and war itself".
he added:
"all this will not be finished in the first one hundred days.
nor will it be finished in the first one thousand days, nor in the life of this administration, nor even perhaps in our lifetime on this planet.
but let us begin."
in closing, he expanded on his desire for greater internationalism: "finally, whether you are citizens of america or citizens of the world, ask of us here the same high standards of strength and sacrifice which we ask of you."
the address reflected kennedy's confidence that his administration would chart a historically significant course in both domestic policy and foreign affairs.
the contrast between this optimistic vision and the pressures of managing daily political realities at home and abroad would be one of the main tensions running through the early years of his administration.
kennedy brought to the white house a contrast in organization compared to the decision-making structure of former-general eisenhower, and he wasted no time in scrapping eisenhower's methods.
kennedy preferred the organizational structure of a wheel with all the spokes leading to the president.
he was ready and willing to make the increased number of quick decisions required in such an environment.
he selected a mixture of experienced and inexperienced people to serve in his cabinet.
"we can learn our jobs together", he stated.
much to the chagrin of his economic advisors, who wanted him to reduce taxes, kennedy quickly agreed to a balanced budget pledge.
this was needed in exchange for votes to expand the membership of the house rules committee in order to give the democrats a majority in setting the legislative agenda.
the president focused on immediate and specific issues facing the administration and quickly voiced his impatience with pondering of deeper meanings.
deputy national security advisor walt whitman rostow once began a diatribe about the growth of communism, and kennedy abruptly cut him off, asking, "what do you want me to do about that today?"
kennedy approved defense secretary robert mcnamara's controversial decision to award the contract for the f-111 tfx (tactical fighter experimental) fighter-bomber to general dynamics (the choice of the civilian defense department) over boeing (the choice of the military).
at the request of senator henry jackson, senator john mcclellan held 46 days of mostly closed-door hearings before the permanent subcommittee on investigations investigating the tfx contract from february to november 1963.
during the summer of 1962, kennedy had a secret taping system set up in the white house, most likely to aid his future memoir.
it recorded many conversations with kennedy and his cabinet members, including those in relation to the "cuban missile crisis".
president kennedy's foreign policy was dominated by american confrontations with the soviet union, manifested by proxy contests in the early stage of the cold war.
in 1961 he anxiously anticipated a summit with soviet premier nikita khrushchev.
he started off on the wrong foot by reacting aggressively to a routine khrushchev speech on cold war confrontation in early-1961.
the speech was intended for domestic audiences in the soviet union, but kennedy interpreted it as a personal challenge.
his mistake helped raise tensions going into the vienna summit of june 1961.
on the way to the summit, kennedy stopped in paris to meet french president charles de gaulle, who advised him to ignore khrushchev's abrasive style.
the french president feared the united states' presumed influence in europe.
nevertheless, de gaulle was quite impressed with the young president and his family.
kennedy picked up on this in his speech in paris, saying that he would be remembered as "the man who accompanied jackie kennedy to paris".
on june 4, 1961, the president met with khrushchev in vienna and left the meetings angry and disappointed that he had allowed the premier to bully him, despite the warnings he had received.
khrushchev, for his part, was impressed with the president's intelligence, but thought him weak.
kennedy did succeed in conveying the bottom line to khrushchev on the most sensitive issue before them, a proposed treaty between moscow and east berlin.
he made it clear that any treaty interfering with u.s. access rights in west berlin would be regarded as an act of war.
shortly after the president returned home, the u.s.s.r. announced its plan to sign a treaty with east berlin, abrogating any third-party occupation rights in either sector of the city.
depressed and angry, kennedy assumed that his only option was to prepare the country for nuclear war, which he personally thought had a one-in-five chance of occurring.
in the weeks immediately following the vienna summit, more than 20,000 people fled from east berlin to the western sector, reacting to statements from the u.s.s.r. kennedy began intensive meetings on the berlin issue, where dean acheson took the lead in recommending a military buildup alongside nato allies.
in a july 1961 speech, kennedy announced his decision to add $3.25 billion (equivalent to $27.81 billion in 2019) to the defense budget, along with over 200,000 additional troops, stating that an attack on west berlin would be taken as an attack on the u.s. the speech received an 85% approval rating.
a month later, both the soviet union and east berlin began blocking any further passage of east berliners into west berlin and erected barbed wire fences across the city, which were quickly upgraded to the berlin wall.
kennedy's initial reaction was to ignore this, as long as free access from west to east berlin continued.
this course was altered when west berliners had lost confidence in the defense of their position by the united states.
kennedy sent vice president johnson, along with a host of military personnel, in convoy through west germany, including soviet-armed checkpoints, to demonstrate the continued commitment of the u.s. to west berlin.
kennedy gave a speech at saint anselm college on may 5, 1960, regarding america's conduct in the emerging cold war.
the address detailed how the american foreign policy should be conducted towards african nations, noting a hint of support for modern african nationalism by saying, "for we, too, founded a new nation on revolt from colonial rule."
the eisenhower administration had created a plan to overthrow fidel castro's regime in cuba.
led by the central intelligence agency (cia), with help from the u.s. military, the plan was for an invasion of cuba by a counter-revolutionary insurgency composed of u.s.-trained, anti-castro cuban exiles led by cia paramilitary officers.
the intention was to invade cuba and instigate an uprising among the cuban people, hoping to remove castro from power.
kennedy approved the final invasion plan on april 4, 1961.
the bay of pigs invasion began on april 17, 1961. fifteen hundred u.s.-trained cubans, dubbed brigade 2506, landed on the island.
no u.s. air support was provided.
cia director allen dulles later stated that they thought the president would authorize any action that was needed for success once the troops were on the ground.
by april 19, 1961, the cuban government had captured or killed the invading exiles, and kennedy was forced to negotiate for the release of the 1,189 survivors.
twenty months later, cuba released the captured exiles in exchange for $53 million worth of food and medicine.
the incident made castro feel wary of the u.s. and led him to believe that another invasion would take place.
biographer richard reeves said that kennedy focused primarily on the political repercussions of the plan rather than military considerations.
when it proved unsuccessful, he was convinced that the plan was a setup to make him look bad.
he took responsibility for the failure, saying, "we got a big kick in the leg and we deserved it.
but maybe we'll learn something from it."
he appointed robert kennedy to help lead a committee to examine the causes of the failure.
in late-1961, the white house formed the special group (augmented), headed by robert kennedy and including edward lansdale, secretary robert mcnamara, and others.
the group's objective—to overthrow castro via espionage, sabotage, and other covert tactics—was never pursued.
on october 14, 1962, cia u-2 spy planes took photographs of the soviets' construction of intermediate-range ballistic missile sites in cuba.
the photos were shown to kennedy on october 16; a consensus was reached that the missiles were offensive in nature and thus posed an immediate nuclear threat.
kennedy faced a dilemma: if the u.s. attacked the sites, it might lead to nuclear war with the u.s.s.r., but if the u.s. did nothing, it would be faced with the increased threat from close-range nuclear weapons.
the u.s. would also appear to the world as less committed to the defense of the hemisphere.
on a personal level, kennedy needed to show resolve in reaction to khrushchev, especially after the vienna summit.
more than a third of u.s. national security council (nsc) members favored an unannounced air assault on the missile sites, but for some of them this conjured up an image of "pearl harbor in reverse".
there was also some concern from the international community (asked in confidence), that the assault plan was an overreaction in light of the fact that eisenhower had placed pgm-19 jupiter missiles in italy and turkey in 1958. it also could not be assured that the assault would be 100% effective.
in concurrence with a majority-vote of the nsc, kennedy decided on a naval quarantine.
on october 22, he dispatched a message to khrushchev and announced the decision on tv.
the u.s. navy would stop and inspect all soviet ships arriving off cuba, beginning october 24. the organization of american states gave unanimous support to the removal of the missiles.
the president exchanged two sets of letters with khrushchev, to no avail.
united nations (un) secretary general u thant requested both parties to reverse their decisions and enter a cooling-off period.
khrushchev agreed, but kennedy did not.
one soviet-flagged ship was stopped and boarded.
on october 28, khrushchev agreed to dismantle the missile sites, subject to un inspections.
the u.s. publicly promised never to invade cuba and privately agreed to remove its jupiter missiles from italy and turkey, which were by then obsolete and had been supplanted by submarines equipped with ugm-27 polaris missiles.
this crisis brought the world closer to nuclear war than at any point before or after.
it is considered that "the humanity" of both khrushchev and kennedy prevailed.
the crisis improved the image of american willpower and the president's credibility.
kennedy's approval rating increased from 66% to 77% immediately thereafter.
believing that "those who make peaceful revolution impossible, will make violent revolution inevitable," kennedy sought to contain the perceived threat of communism in latin america by establishing the alliance for progress, which sent aid to some countries and sought greater human rights standards in the region.
he worked closely with puerto rican governor luis muñoz marín for the development of the alliance of progress, and began working towards puerto rico's autonomy.
the eisenhower administration, through the cia, had begun formulating plans to assassinate castro in cuba and rafael trujillo in the dominican republic.
when president kennedy took office, he privately instructed the cia that any plan must include plausible deniability by the u.s. his public position was in opposition.
in june 1961, the dominican republic's leader was assassinated; in the days following, undersecretary of state chester bowles led a cautious reaction by the nation.
robert kennedy, who saw an opportunity for the u.s., called bowles "a gutless bastard" to his face.
in one of his first presidential acts, kennedy asked congress to create the peace corps.
his brother-in-law, sargent shriver, was its first director.
through this program, americans volunteered to help developing nations in fields like education, farming, health care, and construction.
the organization grew to 5,000 members by march 1963 and 10,000 the year after.
since 1961, over 200,000 americans have joined the peace corps, representing 139 different countries.
as a u.s. senator in 1956, kennedy publicly advocated for greater u.s. involvement in vietnam.
when briefing kennedy, eisenhower emphasized that the communist threat in southeast asia required priority; eisenhower considered laos to be "the cork in the bottle" regarding the regional threat.
in march 1961, kennedy voiced a change in policy from supporting a "free" laos to a "neutral" laos, indicating privately that vietnam, and not laos, should be deemed america's tripwire for communism's spread in the area.
in may, he dispatched lyndon johnson to meet with south vietnamese president ngo dinh diem.
johnson assured diem more aid to mold a fighting force that could resist the communists.
kennedy announced a change of policy from support to partnership with diem to defeat of communism in south vietnam.
during his presidency, kennedy continued policies that provided political, economic, and military support to the governments of south korea and south vietnam.
we have one-million americans today serving outside the united-states.
there's no other country in history that's carried this kind of a burden.
other countries have had forces serving outside their own country, but for conquest.
we have two divisions in south-korea, not to control south-korea, but to defend it.
we have a lot of americans in south vietnam.
well, no other country in the world has ever done that since the beginning of the world; greece, rome, napoleon, and all the rest, always had conquest.
we have a million men outside, and they try to defend these countries.
in late 1961, the viet cong began assuming a predominant presence, initially seizing the provincial capital of phuoc vinh.
kennedy increased the number of military advisers and special forces in the area, from 11,000 in 1962 to 16,000 by late 1963, but he was reluctant to order a full-scale deployment of troops.
a year and three months later on march 8, 1965, his successor, president lyndon johnson, committed the first combat troops to vietnam and greatly escalated u.s. involvement, with forces reaching 184,000 that year and 536,000 in 1968.
in late 1961, president kennedy sent roger hilsman, then director of the state department's bureau of intelligence and research, to assess the situation in vietnam.
there, hilsman met sir robert grainger ker thompson, head of the british advisory mission to south vietnam, and the strategic hamlet program was formed.
it was approved by kennedy and south vietnam president ngo dinh diem.
it was implemented in early 1962 and involved some forced relocation, village internment, and segregation of rural south vietnamese into new communities where the peasantry would be isolated from communist insurgents.
it was hoped that these new communities would provide security for the peasants and strengthen the tie between them and the central government.
by november 1963, the program waned and officially ended in 1964.
in early 1962, kennedy formally authorized escalated involvement when he signed the national security action memorandum – "subversive insurgency (war of liberation)".
"operation ranch hand", a large-scale aerial defoliation effort, began on the roadsides of south vietnam.
depending on which assessment kennedy accepted (department of defense or state), there had been zero or modest progress in countering the increase in communist aggression in return for an expanded u.s. involvement.
in april 1963, kennedy assessed the situation in vietnam, saying, "we don't have a prayer of staying in vietnam.
those people hate us.
they are going to throw our asses out of there at any point.
but i can't give up that territory to the communists and get the american people to re-elect me."
on august 21, just as the new u.s. ambassador henry cabot lodge jr. arrived, diem and his brother ngo dinh nhu ordered south vietnam forces, funded and trained by the cia, to quell buddhist demonstrations.
the crackdowns heightened expectations of a coup d'état to remove diem with (or perhaps by) his brother, nhu.
lodge was instructed to try getting diem and nhu to step down and leave the country.
diem would not listen to lodge.
cable 243 (deptel 243) followed, dated august 24, declaring that washington would no longer tolerate nhu's actions, and lodge was ordered to pressure diem to remove nhu.
lodge concluded that the only option was to get the south vietnamese generals to overthrow diem and nhu.
at week's end, orders were sent to saigon and throughout washington to "destroy all coup cables".
at the same time, the first formal anti-vietnam war sentiment was expressed by u.s. clergy from the ministers' vietnam committee.
a white house meeting in september was indicative of the different ongoing appraisals; the president was given updated assessments after personal inspections on the ground by the departments of defense (general victor krulak) and state (joseph mendenhall).
krulak said that the military fight against the communists was progressing and being won, while mendenhall stated that the country was civilly being lost to any u.s. influence.
kennedy reacted, asking, "did you two gentlemen visit the same country?"
the president was unaware that both men were at such odds that they had not spoken to each other on the return flight.
in october 1963, the president appointed defense secretary mcnamara and general maxwell d. taylor to a vietnamese mission in another effort to synchronize the information and formulation of policy.
the objective of the mcnamara taylor mission "emphasized the importance of getting to the bottom of the differences in reporting from u.s. representatives in vietnam".
in meetings with mcnamara, taylor, and lodge, diem again refused to agree to governing measures, helping to dispel mcnamara's previous optimism about diem.
taylor and mcnamara were enlightened by vietnam's vice president, nguyen ngoc tho (choice of many to succeed diem), who in detailed terms obliterated taylor's information that the military was succeeding in the countryside.
at kennedy's insistence, the mission report contained a recommended schedule for troop withdrawals: 1,000 by year's end and complete withdrawal in 1965, something the nsc considered to be a "strategic fantasy".
in late october, intelligence wires again reported that a coup against the diem government was afoot.
the source, vietnamese general duong van minh (also known as "big minh"), wanted to know the u.s. position.
kennedy instructed lodge to offer covert assistance to the coup, excluding assassination.
on november 1, 1963, south vietnamese generals, led by "big minh", overthrew the diem government, arresting and then killing diem and nhu.
kennedy was shocked by the deaths.
news of the coup led to renewed confidence initially—both in america and in south vietnam—that the war might be won.
mcgeorge bundy drafted a national security action memo to present to kennedy upon his return from dallas.
it reiterated the resolve to fight communism in vietnam, with increasing military and economic aid and expansion of operations into laos and cambodia.
before leaving for dallas, kennedy told michael forrestal that "after the first of the year ... [he wanted] an in depth study of every possible option, including how to get out of there ... to review this whole thing from the bottom to the top".
when asked what he thought the president meant, forrestal said, "it was devil's advocate stuff."
historians disagree on whether the vietnam war would have escalated if kennedy had not been assassinated and had won re-election in 1964. fueling the debate were statements made by secretary of defense mcnamara in the film "the fog of war" that kennedy was strongly considering pulling the united states out of vietnam after the 1964 election.
the film also contains a tape recording of lyndon johnson stating that kennedy was planning to withdraw, a position in which johnson disagreed.
kennedy had signed national security action memorandum (nsam) 263, dated october 11, which ordered the withdrawal of 1,000 military personnel by year's end, and the bulk of them out by 1965. such an action would have been a policy reversal, but kennedy was publicly moving in a less hawkish direction since his speech on world peace at american university on june 10, 1963.
at the time of kennedy's death, no final policy decision was made to vietnam.
in 2008 theodore sorensen wrote, "i would like to believe that kennedy would have found a way to withdraw all american instructors and advisors [from vietnam].
but ... i do not believe he knew in his last weeks what he was going to do."
sorensen added that, in his opinion, vietnam "was the only foreign policy problem handed off by jfk to his successor in no better, and possibly worse, shape than it was when he inherited it."
u.s. involvement in the region escalated until his successor lyndon johnson directly deployed regular u.s. military forces for fighting the vietnam war.
after kennedy's assassination, president johnson signed nsam 273 on november 26, 1963. it reversed kennedy's decision to withdraw 1,000 troops, and reaffirmed the policy of assistance to the south vietnamese.
on june 10, 1963, kennedy, at the high point of his rhetorical powers, delivered the commencement address at american university in washington, d.c. also known as "a strategy of peace", not only did the president outline a plan to curb nuclear arms, but he also "laid out a hopeful, yet realistic route for world peace at a time when the u.s. and soviet union faced the potential for an escalating nuclear arms race."
the president wished:
to discuss a topic on which too often ignorance abounds and the truth is too rarely perceived—yet it is the most important topic on earth: world peace ... i speak of peace because of the new face of war ... in an age when a singular nuclear weapon contains ten times the explosive force delivered by all the allied forces in the second world war ... an age when the deadly poisons produced by a nuclear exchange would be carried by wind and air and soil and seed to the far corners of the globe and to generations yet unborn ... i speak of peace, therefore, as the necessary rational end of rational men ... world peace, like community peace, does not require that each man love his neighbor—it requires only that they live together in mutual tolerance ... our problems are man-made—therefore they can be solved by man.
and man can be as big as he wants.
the president also made two announcements: 1.)
that the soviets had expressed a desire to negotiate a nuclear test ban treaty, and 2.)
that the u.s. had postponed planned atmospheric tests.
in 1963, germany was enduring a time of particular vulnerability due to soviet aggression to the east as well as the impending retirement of west german chancellor adenauer.
at the same time, french president charles de gaulle was trying to build a franco-west german counterweight to the american and soviet spheres of influence.
to kennedy's eyes, this franco-german cooperation seemed directed against nato's influence in europe.
on june 26, president kennedy gave a public speech in west berlin.
he reiterated the american commitment to germany and criticized communism, and was met with an ecstatic response from a massive audience.
kennedy used the construction of the berlin wall as an example of the failures of communism: "freedom has many difficulties, and democracy is not perfect.
but we have never had to put a wall up to keep our people in, to prevent them from leaving us."
the speech is known for its famous phrase "ich bin ein berliner" ("i am a citizen of berlin").
a million people were on the street for the speech.
kennedy remarked to ted sorensen afterwards: "we'll never have another day like this one, as long as we live."
in 1960, kennedy stated, "israel will endure and flourish.
it is the child of hope and the home of the brave.
it can neither be broken by adversity nor demoralized by success.
it carries the shield of democracy and it honors the sword of freedom."
as president, kennedy initiated the creation of security ties with israel, and he is credited as the founder of the us-israeli military alliance, which would be continued under subsequent presidents.
kennedy ended the arms embargo that the eisenhower and truman administrations had enforced on israel.
describing the protection of israel as a moral and national commitment, he was the first to introduce the concept of a "special relationship" (as he described it to golda meir) between the us and israel.
kennedy extended the first informal security guarantees to israel in 1962 and, beginning in 1963, was the first us president to allow the sale to israel of advanced us weaponry (the mim-23 hawk) as well as to provide diplomatic support for israeli policies, which were opposed by arab neighbors; those policies included israel's water project on the jordan river.
as a result of this newly created security alliance, kennedy also encountered tensions with the israeli government over the production of nuclear materials in dimona, which he believed could instigate a nuclear arms-race in the middle east.
after the existence of a nuclear plant was initially denied by the israeli government, david ben-gurion stated in a speech to the israeli knesset on december 21, 1960, that the purpose of the nuclear plant at beersheba was for "research in problems of arid zones and desert flora and fauna".
when ben-gurion met with kennedy in new york, he claimed that dimona was being developed to provide nuclear power for desalinization and other peaceful purposes "for the time being".
in 1963 the kennedy administration was engaged in a now declassified diplomatic standoff with the israel.
in a may 1963 letter to ben-gurion, kennedy wrote that he was skeptical and stated that american support to israel could be in jeopardy if reliable information on the israeli nuclear program was not forthcoming, ben-gurion repeated previous reassurances that dimona was being developed for peaceful purposes.
the israeli government resisted american pressure to open its nuclear facilities to international atomic energy agency (iaea) inspections.
in 1962 the us and israeli governments had agreed to an annual inspection regime.
a science attaché at the embassy in tel aviv concluded that parts of the dimona facility had been shut down temporarily to mislead american scientists when they visited.
according to seymour hersh, the israelis set up false control rooms to show the americans.
israeli lobbyist abe feinberg stated: "it was part of my job to tip them off that kennedy was insisting on [an inspection]."
hersh contends that the inspections were conducted in such a way that it "guaranteed that the whole procedure would be little more than a whitewash, as the president and his senior advisors had to understand: the american inspection team would have to schedule its visits well in advance, and with the full acquiescence of israel."
marc trachtenberg argued that "[a]lthough [he was] well aware of what the israelis were doing, kennedy chose to take this as satisfactory evidence of israeli compliance with america's non-proliferation policy."
the american who led the inspection team stated that the essential goal of the inspections was to find "ways to not reach the point of taking action against israel's nuclear weapons program".
rodger davies, the director of the state department's office of near eastern affairs, concluded in march 1965 that israel was developing nuclear weapons.
he reported that israel's target date for achieving nuclear capability was 1968–1969.
on may 1, 1968, undersecretary of state nicholas katzenbach told president johnson that dimona was producing enough plutonium to produce two bombs a year.
the state department argued that if israel wanted arms, it should accept international supervision of its nuclear program.
dimona was never placed under iaea safeguards.
attempts to write israeli adherence to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (npt) into contracts for the supply of u.s. weapons continued throughout 1968.
relations between the united states and iraq became strained following the overthrow of the iraqi monarchy on july 14, 1958, which resulted in the declaration of a republican government led by brigadier abd al-karim qasim.
on june 25, 1961, qasim mobilized troops along the border between iraq and kuwait, declaring the latter nation "an indivisible part of iraq" and causing a short-lived "kuwait crisis".
the united kingdom—which had just granted kuwait independence on june 19, and whose economy was heavily dependent on kuwaiti oil—responded on july 1 by dispatching 5,000 troops to the country to deter an iraqi invasion.
at the same time, kennedy dispatched a u.s. navy task force to bahrain, and the uk (at the urging of the kennedy administration) brought the dispute to united nations security council, where the proposed resolution was vetoed by the soviet union.
the situation was resolved in october, when the british troops were withdrawn and replaced by a 4,000-strong arab league force.
in december 1961, qasim's government passed public law 80, which restricted the british- and american-owned iraq petroleum company (ipc)'s concessionary holding to those areas in which oil was actually being produced, effectively expropriating 99.5% of the ipc concession.
u.s. officials were alarmed by the expropriation as well as the recent soviet veto of an egyptian-sponsored un resolution requesting the admittance of kuwait as un member state, which they believed were connected.
senior national security council adviser robert komer worried that if the ipc ceased production in response, qasim might "grab kuwait" (thus achieving a "stranglehold" on middle eastern oil production) or "throw himself into russian arms".
komer also made note of widespread rumors that a nationalist coup against qasim could be imminent, and had the potential to "get iraq back on [a] more neutral keel".
in april 1962, the state department issued new guidelines on iraq that were intended to increase american influence there.
meanwhile, kennedy instructed the cia—under the direction of archibald bulloch roosevelt jr.—to begin making preparations for a military coup against qasim.
the anti-imperialist and anti-communist iraqi ba'ath party overthrew and executed qasim in a violent coup on february 8, 1963. while there have been persistent rumors that the cia orchestrated the coup, declassified documents and the testimony of former cia officers indicate that there was no direct american involvement, although the cia was actively seeking a suitable replacement for qasim within the iraqi military and had been informed of an earlier ba'athist coup plot.
the kennedy administration was pleased with the outcome and ultimately approved a $55-million arms deal for iraq.
during his four-day visit to his ancestral home of ireland in june 1963, kennedy accepted a grant of armorial bearings from the chief herald of ireland and received honorary degrees from the national university of ireland and trinity college, dublin.
he visited the cottage at dunganstown, near new ross, county wexford, where his ancestors had lived before emigrating to america.
kennedy also was the first foreign leader to address the houses of the oireachtas (the irish parliament).
on december 22, 2006, the irish department of justice released declassified police documents indicating that security was heightened as kennedy was the subject of three death threats during this visit.
troubled by the long-term dangers of radioactive contamination and nuclear weapons proliferation, kennedy and khrushchev agreed to negotiate a nuclear test ban treaty, originally conceived in adlai stevenson's 1956 presidential campaign.
in their vienna summit meeting in june 1961, khrushchev and kennedy both reached an informal understanding against nuclear testing, but the soviet union began testing nuclear weapons that september.
in response, the united states conducted tests five days later.
shortly afterwards, new u.s. satellites began delivering images which made it clear that the soviets were substantially behind the u.s. in the arms race.
nevertheless, the greater nuclear strength of the u.s. was of little value as long as the u.s.s.r. perceived itself to be at parity.
in july 1963, kennedy sent w. averell harriman to moscow to negotiate a treaty with the soviets.
the introductory sessions included khrushchev, who later delegated soviet representation to andrei gromyko.
it quickly became clear that a comprehensive test ban would not be implemented, due largely to the reluctance of the soviets to allow inspections that would verify compliance.
ultimately, the united states, the united kingdom, and the soviet union were the initial signatories to a limited treaty, which prohibited atomic testing on the ground, in the atmosphere, or underwater, but not underground.
the u.s. senate ratified this and kennedy signed it into law in october 1963. france was quick to declare that it was free to continue developing and testing its nuclear defenses.
kennedy called his domestic program the "new frontier".
it ambitiously promised federal funding for education, medical care for the elderly, economic aid to rural regions, and government intervention to halt the recession.
he also promised an end to racial discrimination, although his agenda, which included the endorsement of the voter education project (vep) in 1962, produced little progress in areas such as mississippi, where the "vep concluded that discrimination was so entrenched".
in his 1963 state of the union address, he proposed substantial tax reform and a reduction in income tax rates from the current range of 20–90% to a range of 14–65% as well as a reduction in the corporate tax rates from 52 to 47%.
kennedy added that the top rate should be set at 70% if certain deductions were not eliminated for high-income earners.
congress did not act until 1964, a year after his death, when the top individual rate was lowered to 70%, and the top corporate rate was set at 48%.
to the economic club of new york, he spoke in 1963 of "... the paradoxical truth that tax rates are too high and revenues too low; and the soundest way to raise revenue in the long term is to lower rates now."
congress passed few of kennedy's major programs during his lifetime, but did vote them through in 1964 and 1965 under his successor johnson.
kennedy ended a period of tight fiscal policies, loosening monetary policy to keep interest rates down and to encourage growth of the economy.
he presided over the first government budget to top the $100 billion mark, in 1962, and his first budget in 1961 resulted in the nation's first non-war, non-recession deficit.
the economy, which had been through two recessions in three years and was in one when kennedy took office, accelerated notably throughout his administration.
despite low inflation and interest rates, the gdp had grown by an average of only 2.2% per annum during the eisenhower administration (scarcely more than population growth at the time), and it had declined by 1% during eisenhower's last twelve months in office.
the economy turned around and prospered during kennedy's years as president.
the gdp expanded by an average of 5.5% from early-1961 to late-1963, while inflation remained steady at around 1% and unemployment eased.
industrial production rose by 15% and motor vehicle sales increased by 40%.
this rate of growth in gdp and industry continued until 1969, and has yet to be repeated for such a sustained period of time.
attorney general robert kennedy took the position that steel executives had illegally colluded to fix prices.
he stated, "we're going for broke.
[...] their expense accounts, where they've been and what they've been doing.
[...] the fbi is to interview them all.
[...] we can't lose this."
the administration's actions influenced u.s. steel to rescind the price increase.
the wall street journal wrote that the administration had acted "by naked power, by threats, [and] by agents of the state security police".
yale law professor charles reich opined in the new republic that the administration had violated civil liberties by calling a grand jury to indict u.s. steel for collusion so quickly.
an editorial in the new york times praised kennedy's actions and said that the steel industry's price increase "imperil[ed] the economic welfare of the country by inviting a tidal wave of inflation".
nevertheless, the administration's bureau of budget reported the price increase would have caused a net gain for the gdp as well as a net budget surplus.
the stock market, which had steadily declined since kennedy's election in 1960, dropped 10% shortly after the administration's action on the steel industry took place.
during his administration, kennedy oversaw the last federal execution prior to furman v. georgia, a 1972 case that led to a moratorium on federal executions.
victor feguer was sentenced to death by an iowa federal court and was executed on march 15, 1963. kennedy commuted a death sentence imposed by a military court on seaman jimmie henderson on february 12, 1962, changing the penalty to life in prison.
on march 22, 1962, kennedy signed into law hr5143 (pl87-423), which abolished the mandatory death penalty for first degree murder suspects in the district of columbia, the only remaining jurisdiction in the united states with such a penalty.
the death penalty has not been applied in the district of columbia since 1957, and has now been abolished.
the turbulent end of state-sanctioned racial discrimination was one of the most pressing domestic issues of the 1960s.
jim crow segregation was the established law in the deep south.
the u.s. supreme court had ruled in 1954 in brown v. board of education that racial segregation in public schools was unconstitutional.
many schools, especially those in southern states, did not obey the supreme court's decision.
the court also prohibited segregation at other public facilities (such as buses, restaurants, theaters, courtrooms, bathrooms, and beaches) but it continued nonetheless.
kennedy verbally supported racial integration and civil rights; during his 1960 presidential campaign, he telephoned coretta scott king, wife of the reverend martin luther king jr., who had been jailed while trying to integrate a department store lunch counter.
robert kennedy called georgia governor ernest vandiver and obtained king's release from prison, which drew additional black support to his brother's candidacy.
upon taking office in 1961, kennedy postponed promised civil rights legislation he made while campaigning in 1960, recognizing that conservative southern democrats controlled congressional legislation.
historian carl m. brauer concluded that passing any civil rights legislation in 1961 would have been futile.
during his first year in office, kennedy appointed many blacks to office including his may appointment of civil rights attorney thurgood marshall to the federal bench.
in his first state of the union address in january 1961, president kennedy said, "the denial of constitutional rights to some of our fellow americans on account of race—at the ballot box and elsewhere—disturbs the national conscience, and subjects us to the charge of world opinion that our democracy is not equal to the high promise of our heritage."
kennedy believed the grassroots movement for civil rights would anger many southern whites and make it more difficult to pass civil rights laws in congress, including anti-poverty legislation, and he distanced himself from it.
kennedy was concerned with other issues in the early part of his administration, such as the cold war, bay of pigs fiasco, and the situation in southeast asia.
as articulated by his brother robert, the administration's early priority was to "keep the president out of this civil rights mess".
civil rights movement participants, mainly those on the front line in the south, viewed kennedy as lukewarm,  especially concerning the freedom riders, who organized an integrated public transportation effort in the south, and who were repeatedly met with white mob violence, including by law enforcement officers, both federal and state.
kennedy assigned federal marshals to protect the freedom riders rather than using federal troops or uncooperative fbi agents.
robert kennedy, speaking for the president, urged the freedom riders to "get off the buses and leave the matter to peaceful settlement in the courts".
kennedy feared sending federal troops would stir up "hated memories of reconstruction" after the civil war among conservative southern whites.
on march 6, 1961, kennedy signed executive order 10925, which required government contractors to "take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed and that employees are treated during employment without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin".
it established the president's committee on equal employment opportunity.
displeased with kennedy's pace addressing the issue of segregation, martin luther king jr. and his associates produced a document in 1962 calling on the president to follow in the footsteps of abraham lincoln and use an executive order to deliver a blow for civil rights as a kind of second emancipation proclamation.
kennedy did not execute the order.
in september 1962, james meredith enrolled at the university of mississippi but was prevented from entering.
in response to that, robert kennedy, now u.s. attorney general, sent 400 federal marshals, while president kennedy reluctantly sent 3,000 troops after the situation on campus turned out violent.
the ole miss riot of 1962 left two people dead and a dozen others injured, but meredith did finally enroll for class.
kennedy regretted not sending in troops earlier and he began doubting as to whether the "evils of reconstruction" of the 1860s and 1870s he had been taught or believed in were true.
the instigating subculture at the ole miss riot of 1962, and at many other racially ignited events, was the ku klux klan.
on november 20, 1962, kennedy signed executive order 11063, which prohibited racial discrimination in federally supported housing or "related facilities".
both the president and the attorney general were concerned about king's ties to suspected communists jack o'dell and stanley levison.
after the president and his civil rights expert harris wofford pressed king to ask both men to resign from the sclc, king agreed to ask only o'dell to resign from the organization and allowed levison, whom he regarded as a trusted advisor, to remain.
in early 1963, kennedy related to martin luther king jr. his thoughts on the prospects for civil rights legislation: "if we get into a long fight over this in congress, it will bottleneck everything else, and we will still get no bill."
civil rights clashes were on the rise that year.
brother robert and ted sorensen pressed kennedy to take more initiative on the legislative front.
on june 11, 1963, president kennedy intervened when alabama governor george wallace blocked the doorway to the university of alabama to stop two african american students, vivian malone and james hood, from attending.
wallace moved aside only after being confronted by deputy attorney general nicholas katzenbach and the alabama u.s. national guard, which had just been federalized by order of the president.
that evening kennedy gave his famous report to the american people on civil rights on national television and radio, launching his initiative for civil rights legislation—to provide equal access to public schools and other facilities, and greater protection of voting rights.
his proposals became part of the civil rights act of 1964. the day ended with the murder of a naacp leader, medgar evers, in front of his home in mississippi.
as the president had predicted, the day after his tv speech, and in reaction to it, house majority leader carl albert called to advise him that his two-year signature effort in congress to combat poverty in appalachia (area redevelopment administration) had been defeated, primarily by the votes of southern democrats and republicans.
when arthur m. schlesinger jr. complimented kennedy on his remarks, kennedy bitterly replied, "yes, and look at what happened to area development the very next day in the house."
he then added, "but of course, i had to give that speech, and i'm glad that i did."
on june 16, the new york times published an editorial which argued that while the president had initially "moved too slowly and with little evidence of deep moral commitment" in regards to civil rights he "now demonstrate[d] a genuine sense of urgency about eradicating racial discrimination from our national life".
earlier, kennedy had signed the executive order creating the presidential commission on the status of women on december 14, 1961. former first lady eleanor roosevelt led the commission.
the commission statistics revealed that women were also experiencing discrimination; its final report, documenting legal and cultural barriers, was issued in october 1963. further, on june 10, 1963, kennedy signed the equal pay act of 1963, which amended the fair labor standards act and abolished wage disparity based on sex.
over a hundred thousand, predominantly african americans gathered in washington for the civil rights march on washington for jobs and freedom on august 28, 1963. kennedy feared the march would have a negative effect on the prospects for the civil rights bills in congress, and declined an invitation to speak.
he turned over some of the details of the government's involvement to the dept.
of justice, which channelled hundreds of thousands of dollars to the six sponsors of the march, including the n.a.a.c.p.
and martin luther king's southern christian leadership conference (sclc).
to ensure a peaceful demonstration, the organizers and the president personally edited speeches which were inflammatory and agreed the march would be held on a wednesday and would be over at 4:00 pm.
thousands of troops were placed on standby.
kennedy watched king's speech on tv and was very impressed.
the march was considered a "triumph of managed protest", and not one arrest relating to the demonstration occurred.
afterwards, the march leaders accepted an invitation to the white house to meet with kennedy and photos were taken.
kennedy felt that the march was a victory for him as well and bolstered the chances for his civil rights bill.
nevertheless, the struggle was far from over.
three weeks later on sunday, september 15, a bomb exploded at the 16th street baptist church in birmingham; by the end of the day, four african american children had died in the explosion, and two other children were shot to death in the aftermath.
due to this resurgent violence, the civil rights legislation underwent some drastic amendments that critically endangered any prospects for passage of the bill, to the outrage of the president.
kennedy called the congressional leaders to the white house and by the following day the original bill, without the additions, had enough votes to get it out of the house committee.
gaining republican support, senator everett dirksen promised the legislation would be brought to a vote preventing a senate filibuster.
the legislation was enacted by kennedy's successor president lyndon b. johnson, prompted by kennedy's memory, after his assassination in november, enforcing voting rights, public accommodations, employment, education, and the administration of justice.
in february 1962, fbi director j. edgar hoover, who was suspicious of civil-rights leader martin luther king jr. and viewed him as an upstart troublemaker, presented the kennedy administration with allegations that some of king's close confidants and advisers were communists.
concerned by these allegations, the fbi deployed agents to monitor king in the following months.
robert kennedy and the president also both warned king to discontinue the suspect associations.
after the associations continued, robert kennedy issued a written directive authorizing the fbi to wiretap king and other leaders of the southern christian leadership conference, king's civil rights organization, in october 1963.
although kennedy only gave written approval for limited wiretapping of king's phones "on a trial basis, for a month or so", hoover extended the clearance so his men were "unshackled" to look for evidence in any areas of king's life they deemed worthy.
the wiretapping continued through june 1966 and was revealed in 1968.
during the 1960 campaign, kennedy proposed an overhaul of american immigration and naturalization laws to ban discrimination based on national origin.
he saw this proposal as an extension of his planned civil rights agenda as president.
these reforms later became law through the immigration and nationality act of 1965, which dramatically shifted the source of immigration from northern and western european countries towards immigration from latin america and asia.
the policy change also shifted the emphasis in the selection of immigrants in favor of family reunification.
the late-president's brother, senator edward kennedy of massachusetts helped steer the legislation through the senate.
construction of the kinzua dam flooded 10,000 acres (4,047 ha) of seneca nation land that they had occupied under the treaty of 1794, and forced 600 seneca to relocate to salamanca, new york.
kennedy was asked by the american civil liberties union to intervene and to halt the project, but he declined, citing a critical need for flood control.
he expressed concern about the plight of the seneca, and directed government agencies to assist in obtaining more land, damages, and assistance to help mitigate their displacement.
the apollo program was conceived early in 1960, during the eisenhower administration, as a follow-up to project mercury, to be used as a shuttle to an earth-orbital space station, flights around the moon, or landing on it.
while nasa went ahead with planning for apollo, funding for the program was far from certain, given eisenhower's ambivalent attitude to manned spaceflight.
as senator, kennedy had been opposed to the space program and wanted to terminate it.
in constructing his presidential administration, kennedy elected to retain eisenhower's last science advisor jerome wiesner as head of the president's science advisory committee.
wiesner was strongly opposed to manned space exploration, having issued a report highly critical of project mercury.
kennedy was turned down by seventeen candidates for nasa administrator before the post was accepted by james e. webb, an experienced washington insider who served president truman as budget director and undersecretary of state.
webb proved to be adept at obtaining the support of congress, the president, and the american people.
kennedy also persuaded congress to amend the national aeronautics and space act to allow him to delegate his chairmanship of the national aeronautics and space council to the vice president, both because of the knowledge of the space program johnson gained in the senate working for the creation of nasa, and to help keep the politically savvy johnson occupied.
in kennedy's january 1961 state of the union address, he had suggested international cooperation in space.
khrushchev declined, as the soviets did not wish to reveal the status of their rocketry and space capabilities.
early in his presidency, kennedy was poised to dismantle the manned space program but postponed any decision out of deference to johnson, who had been a strong supporter of the space program in the senate.
kennedy's advisors speculated that a moon flight would be prohibitively expensive, and he was considering plans to dismantle the apollo program due to its cost.
however, this quickly changed on april 12, 1961, when soviet cosmonaut yuri gagarin became the first person to fly in space, reinforcing american fears about being left behind in a technological competition with the soviet union.
kennedy now became eager for the u.s. to take the lead in the space race, for reasons of national security and prestige.
on april 20, he sent a memo to johnson, asking him to look into the status of america's space program, and into programs that could offer nasa the opportunity to catch up.
after consulting with wernher von braun, johnson responded approximately one week later, concluding that "we are neither making maximum effort nor achieving results necessary if this country is to reach a position of leadership".
his memo concluded that a manned moon landing was far enough in the future that it was likely the united states would achieve it first.
kennedy's advisor ted sorensen advised him to support the moon landing, and on may 25, kennedy announced the goal in a speech titled "special message to the congress on urgent national needs":
... i believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth.
no single space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind, or more important for the long-range exploration of space; and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish.

after congress authorized the funding, webb began reorganizing nasa, increasing its staffing level, and building two new centers: a launch operations center for the large moon rocket northwest of cape canaveral air force station, and a manned spacecraft center on land donated through rice university in houston, texas.
kennedy took the latter occasion as an opportunity to deliver another speech at rice to promote the space effort on september 12, 1962, in which he said:
no nation which expects to be the leader of other nations can expect to stay behind in this race for space.
... we choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard.

on november 21, 1962, in a cabinet meeting with nasa administrator webb and other officials, kennedy explained that the moon shot was important for reasons of international prestige, and that the expense was justified.
johnson assured him that lessons learned from the space program had military value as well.
costs for the apollo program were expected to reach $40 billion (equivalent to $338.09 billion in 2019).
in a september 1963 speech before the united nations, kennedy urged cooperation between the soviets and americans in space, specifically recommending that apollo be switched to "a joint expedition to the moon".
khrushchev again declined, and the soviets did not commit to a manned moon mission until 1964. on july 20, 1969, almost six years after kennedy's death, apollo 11 landed the first manned spacecraft on the moon.
kennedy appointed the following justices to the supreme court of the united states:
in addition to his two supreme court appointments, kennedy appointed 21 judges to the united states courts of appeals, and 102 judges to the united states district courts.
president kennedy was assassinated in dallas, texas, at 12:30 pm central standard time on friday, november 22, 1963. he was in texas on a political trip to smooth over frictions in the democratic party between liberals ralph yarborough and don yarborough (no relation) and conservative john connally.
traveling in a presidential motorcade through downtown dallas, he was shot once in the back, the bullet exiting via his throat, and once in the head.
kennedy was taken to parkland hospital for emergency medical treatment, where he was pronounced dead 30 minutes later.
he was 46 years old and had been in office for 1,036 days.
lee harvey oswald, an order filler at the texas school book depository from which the shots were fired, was arrested for the murder of police officer j.d.
tippit and was subsequently charged with kennedy's assassination.
he denied shooting anyone, claiming he was a patsy, and was shot by jack ruby on november 24, before he could be prosecuted.
ruby was arrested and convicted for the murder of oswald.
ruby successfully appealed his conviction and death sentence but became ill and died of cancer on january 3, 1967, while the date for his new trial was being set.
president johnson quickly issued an executive order to create the warren commission—chaired by chief justice earl warren—to investigate the assassination.
the commission concluded that oswald acted alone in killing kennedy and that oswald was not part of any conspiracy.
the results of this investigation are disputed by many.
the assassination proved to be a pivotal moment in u.s. history because of its impact on the nation, and the ensuing political repercussions.
a 2004 fox news poll found that 66% of americans thought there had been a conspiracy to kill president kennedy, while 74% thought that there had been a cover-up.
a gallup poll in november 2013 showed 61% believed in a conspiracy, and only 30% thought that oswald did it alone.
in 1979 the u.s. house select committee on assassinations concluded that it believed "that kennedy was probably assassinated as a result of a conspiracy.
the committee was unable to identify the other gunmen or the extent of the conspiracy."
in 2002 historian carl m. brauer concluded that the public's "fascination with the assassination may indicate a psychological denial of kennedy's death, a mass wish ... to undo it".
a requiem mass was celebrated for kennedy at the cathedral of st. matthew the apostle on november 25, 1963. afterwards, kennedy was interred in a small plot, 20 by 30 ft., in arlington national cemetery.
over a period of three years (1964–1966), an estimated 16 million people visited his grave.
on march 14, 1967, kennedy's remains were disinterred and moved only a few feet away to a permanent burial plot and memorial.
it was from this memorial that the graves of both robert and ted kennedy were modeled.
the honor guard at kennedy's graveside was the 37th cadet class of the irish army.
kennedy was greatly impressed by the irish cadets on his last official visit to ireland, so much so that jacqueline kennedy requested the irish army to be the honor guard at her husband's funeral.
jacqueline and their two deceased minor children were later interred in the same plot.
kennedy's brother robert was buried nearby in june 1968. in august 2009, ted was also buried near his two brothers.
john f. kennedy's grave is lit with an "eternal flame".
kennedy and william howard taft are the only two u.s. presidents buried at arlington.
according to the jfk library, "i have a rendezvous with death", by alan seeger "was one of john f. kennedy's favorite poems and he often asked his wife to recite it".
the kennedy family is one of the most established political families in the united states, having produced a president, three senators, three ambassadors, and multiple other representatives and politicians, both at the federal and state level.
while a congressman, kennedy embarked on a seven-week trip to india, japan, vietnam, and israel in 1951, at which point he became close with his then 25-year-old brother bobby, as well as his 27-year-old sister pat.
because they were several years apart in age, the brothers had previously seen little of each other.
this 25,000-mile (40,000 km) trip was the first extended time they had spent together and resulted in their becoming best friends.
bobby would eventually play a major role in his brother's career, serving as his brother's attorney general and presidential advisor.
bobby would later run for president in 1968 before his assassination, while another kennedy brother, ted, ran for president in 1980.
kennedy came in third (behind martin luther king jr. and mother teresa) in gallup's list of widely admired people of the 20th century.
kennedy was a life member of the national rifle association.
kennedy met his future wife, jacqueline lee "jackie" bouvier (1929–1994), when he was a congressman.
charles l. bartlett, a journalist, introduced the pair at a dinner party.
they were married a year after he was elected senator, on september 12, 1953. after suffering a miscarriage in 1955 and a stillbirth in 1956 (their daughter arabella), their daughter caroline was born in 1957 and is the only surviving member of jfk's immediate family.
john fitzgerald kennedy jr., nicknamed "john-john" by the press as a child, was born in late november 1960, 17 days after his father was elected.
john jr., a graduate of brown university, died in 1999 when the small plane he was piloting crashed en route to martha's vineyard.
in 1963, months before jfk's assassination, jackie gave birth to a son, patrick.
however, he died after 2 days due to complications from birth.
kennedy and his wife were younger in comparison to the presidents and first ladies who preceded them, and both were popular in the media culture in ways more common to pop singers and movie stars than politicians, influencing fashion trends and becoming the subjects of numerous photo spreads in popular magazines.
although eisenhower had allowed presidential press conferences to be filmed for television, kennedy was the first president to ask for them to be broadcast live and made good use of the medium.
in 1961 the radio-television news directors association presented kennedy with its highest honor, the paul white award, in recognition of his open relationship with the media.
mrs. kennedy brought new art and furniture to the white house, and directed its restoration.
they invited a range of artists, writers and intellectuals to rounds of white house dinners, raising the profile of the arts in america.
on the white house lawn, the kennedys established a swimming pool and tree house, while caroline attended a preschool along with 10 other children inside the home.
the president was closely tied to popular culture, emphasized by songs such as "twisting at the white house".
vaughn meader's first family comedy album, which parodied the president, the first lady, their family, and the administration, sold about four million copies.
on may 19, 1962, marilyn monroe sang "happy birthday, mr. president" at a large party in madison square garden, celebrating kennedy's upcoming forty-fifth birthday.
the term "camelot" came to be used retrospectively as iconic of the kennedy administration, and the charisma of kennedy and his family.
the term was first publicly used by his wife in a post-assassination life magazine interview with theodore h. white, in which she revealed his affection for the contemporary broadway musical of the same name, particularly the closing lines of the title song:
don't let it be forgot, that once there was a spot, for one brief, shining moment that was known as camelot.there'll be great presidents again ... but there will never be another camelot.
in 2002, robert dallek wrote an extensive history of kennedy's health.
dallek was able to consult a collection of kennedy-associated papers from the years 1955–1963, including x-rays and prescription records from the files of white house physician dr. janet travell.
according to travell's records, during his presidential years kennedy suffered from high fevers; stomach, colon, and prostate issues; abscesses; high cholesterol; and adrenal problems.
travell kept a "medicine administration record," cataloguing kennedy's medications: "injected and ingested corticosteroids for his adrenal insufficiency; procaine shots and ultrasound treatments and hot packs for his back; lomotil, metamucil, paregoric, phenobarbital, testosterone, and trasentine to control his diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, and weight loss; penicillin and other antibiotics for his urinary-tract infections and an abscess; and tuinal to help him sleep."
years after kennedy's death, it was revealed that in september 1947, while kennedy was 30 and in his first term in congress, he was diagnosed by sir daniel davis at the london clinic with addison's disease, a rare endocrine disorder.
davis estimated that kennedy would not live for another year, while kennedy himself hoped he could live for an additional ten.
in 1966, dr. travell revealed that kennedy also had hypothyroidism.
the presence of two endocrine diseases raises the possibility that kennedy had autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 2 (aps 2).
kennedy also suffered from chronic and severe back pain, for which he had surgery and was written up in the american medical association's archives of surgery.
kennedy's condition may have had diplomatic repercussions, as he appears to have been taking a combination of drugs to treat severe back pain during the 1961 vienna summit with soviet premier nikita khrushchev.
the combination included hormones, animal organ cells, steroids, vitamins, enzymes, and amphetamines, and possible potential side effects included hyperactivity, hypertension, impaired judgment, nervousness, and mood swings.
kennedy at one time was regularly seen by no fewer than three doctors, one of whom, max jacobson, was unknown to the other two, as his mode of treatment was controversial and used for the most severe bouts of back pain.
into late 1961, disagreements existed among kennedy's doctors concerning his proper balance of medication and exercise.
the president preferred the former, because he was short on time and desired immediate relief.
during that time, the president's physician, george burkley, did set up some gym equipment in the white house basement, where kennedy did stretching exercises for his back three times a week.
details of these and other medical problems were not publicly disclosed during kennedy's lifetime.
the president's primary white house physician, george burkley, realized that treatments by jacobson and travell, including the excessive use of steroids and amphetamines, were medically inappropriate, and took effective action to remove the president from their care.
dr. nassir ghaemi, a physician who reviewed kennedy's medical records in his presidential archives, has opined that kennedy's leadership (e.g.
the 1962 cuban missile crisis and other events during 1963) improved greatly once the treatments of jacobson had been discontinued and been replaced by a medically appropriate regimen under burkley.
ghaemi concluded there was a "correlation; it is not causation; but it may not be coincidence either".
kennedy and his family have experienced a number of personal tragedies.
his older brother joseph p. kennedy jr. was killed in action in 1944 at age 29, when his plane exploded over the english channel during a first attack execution of operation aphrodite during world war ii.
kennedy's younger sister rose marie "rosemary" kennedy was born in 1918 with intellectual disabilities and underwent a prefrontal lobotomy at age 23, leaving her incapacitated for the rest of her life, until her death in 2005. his younger sister kathleen agnes "kick" kennedy died in a plane crash en route to france in 1948. his wife jacqueline kennedy suffered a miscarriage in 1955 and a stillbirth in 1956: a daughter informally named arabella.
a son, patrick bouvier kennedy, died two days after birth in august 1963.
kennedy was single in the 1940s when he had affairs with danish journalist inga arvad and actress gene tierney.
before and after he assumed the presidency, kennedy reportedly had affairs with a number of women, including marilyn monroe, gunilla von post, judith campbell, mary pinchot meyer, marlene dietrich, mimi alford, and his wife's press secretary, pamela turnure.
the extent of kennedy's relationship with monroe is not fully known, although it has been reported that they spent a weekend together in march 1962 while he was staying at bing crosby's house.
furthermore, people at the white house switchboard noted that monroe had called kennedy during 1962. j. edgar hoover, the fbi director, received reports about kennedy's indiscretions.
kennedy inspired affection and loyalty from the members of his team and his supporters.
according to reeves, this included "the logistics of kennedy's liaisons ... [which] required secrecy and devotion rare in the annals of the energetic service demanded by successful politicians."
kennedy believed that his friendly relationship with members of the press would help protect him from public revelations about his sex life.
lem billings was a close and long-time friend of kennedy and the kennedy family.
billings had his own room in which to stay at several of john f. kennedy's residences.
though there has never been any proof of homosexual activity between them, kennedy would often, and even when married, share a bedroom with his lifelong friend.
the us special forces had a special bond with kennedy.
"it was president kennedy who was responsible for the rebuilding of the special forces and giving us back our green beret," said forrest lindley, a writer for the us military newspaper stars and stripes who served with special forces in vietnam.
[a] this bond was shown at kennedy's funeral.
at the commemoration of the 25th anniversary of kennedy's death, general michael d. healy, the last commander of special forces in vietnam, spoke at arlington cemetery.
later, a wreath in the form of the green beret would be placed on the grave, continuing a tradition that began the day of his funeral when a sergeant in charge of a detail of special forces men guarding the grave placed his beret on the coffin.
kennedy was the first of six presidents to have served in the u.s. navy, and one of the enduring legacies of his administration was the creation in 1961 of another special forces command, the navy seals, which kennedy enthusiastically supported.
kennedy's civil rights proposals led to the civil rights act of 1964. president lyndon b. johnson, kennedy's successor, took up the mantle and pushed the landmark civil rights act through a bitterly divided congress by invoking the slain president's memory.
president johnson then signed the act into law on july 2, 1964. this civil rights law ended what was known as the "solid south" and certain provisions were modeled after the civil rights act of 1875, signed into law by president ulysses s. grant.
kennedy's continuation of presidents harry s. truman and dwight d. eisenhower's policies of giving economic and military aid to south vietnam left the door open for president johnson's escalation of the conflict.
at the time of kennedy's death, no final policy decision had been made as to vietnam, leading historians, cabinet members, and writers to continue to disagree on whether the vietnam conflict would have escalated to the point it did had he survived.
his agreement to the nsam 263 action of withdrawing 1,000 troops by the end of 1963, and his earlier 1963 speech at american university, suggest that he was ready to end the vietnam war.
the vietnam war contributed greatly to a decade of national difficulties, amid violent disappointment on the political landscape.
many of kennedy's speeches (especially his inaugural address) are considered iconic; and despite his relatively short term in office, and the lack of major legislative changes coming to fruition during his term, americans regularly vote him as one of the best presidents, in the same league as abraham lincoln, george washington, and franklin d. roosevelt.
some excerpts of kennedy's inaugural address are engraved on a plaque at his grave at arlington.
in 2018 the times published an audio recreation of the "watchmen on the walls of world freedom" speech he was scheduled to deliver at the dallas trade mart on november 22, 1963.
he was posthumously awarded the pacem in terris award (latin: peace on earth).
it was named after a 1963 encyclical letter by pope john xxiii that calls upon all people of goodwill to secure peace among all nations.
kennedy also posthumously received the presidential medal of freedom in 1963. as of 2019,[update] he has been the only catholic u.s. president.
throughout the english-speaking world, the given name kennedy has sometimes been used in honor of president kennedy, as well his brother robert.
television was the primary source that kept people informed of the events that surrounded kennedy's assassination.
in fact, television started to come of age before the assassination.
on september 2, 1963, kennedy helped inaugurate network television's first half-hour nightly evening newscast according to an interview with cbs evening news anchor walter cronkite.
newspapers were kept as souvenirs rather than sources of updated information.
[citation needed] in this sense his assassination was the first major tv news event of its kind.
tv coverage united the nation, interpreting what went on, and creating memories of this space in time.
[citation needed] all three major u.s. television networks suspended their regular schedules and switched to all-news coverage from november 22 through november 26, 1963, being on the air for 70 hours, making it the longest uninterrupted news event on american tv until 9/11.
the assassination had an effect on many people, not only in the u.s. but around the world.
many vividly remember where they were when they first learned the news that kennedy was assassinated, as with the japanese attack on pearl harbor on december 7, 1941, before it and the september 11 attacks after it.
un ambassador adlai stevenson ii said of the assassination: "all of us.
... .
will bear the grief of his death until the day of ours."
many people have also spoken of the shocking news, compounded by the pall of uncertainty about the identity of the assassin(s), the possible instigators, and the causes of the killing, as an end to innocence, and in retrospect it has been coalesced with other changes of the tumultuous decade of the 1960s, especially the vietnam war.
ultimately, the death of president kennedy, and the ensuing confusion surrounding the facts of his assassination, are of political and historical importance insofar as they marked a turning point and decline in the faith of the american people in the political establishment—a point made by commentators from gore vidal to arthur m. schlesinger jr. and implied by oliver stone in several of his films, such as his landmark 1991 jfk.

general:
the 1963 life article represented the first use of the term "camelot" in print and is attributed with having played a major role in establishing and fixing this image of the kennedy administration and period in the popular mind.
placia or plakia or placie or plakie (ancient greek: πλακίη), also known as placa or plaka or place or plake (πλάκη), was a town of ancient mysia, on the coast of the propontis, at the foot of the mysian olympus east of cyzicus.
it was a pelasgian town; in this place and the neighbouring scylace, the pelasgians, according to herodotus, had preserved their ancient language down to his time.
the town is mentioned in the periplus of pseudo-scylax, and by pomponius mela, dionysius of halicarnassus and pliny the elder.
its site is tentatively located near kurşunlu, asiatic turkey.

pérola ellis byington (december 3, 1879 —  6 november 1963) was a brazilian philanthropist and social activist.
she was an advocate for mother and children's health assistance in brazil during the first half of 20th century.
on december 3, 1879, byington was born as pearl ellis mcintyre in santa bárbara d'oeste, são paulo, brazil.
byington's parents were mary elisabeth ellis and robert dickson mcintyre, american confederado immigrants who settled in santa bárbara d'oeste.
she adopted the portuguese form of her name (pérola) and in 1894 when pérola was fourteen years old, she completed the preparation for the normal school, but was not admitted because the minimum age requirement was sixteen years old.
byington received private lessons in education, except latin, which she took at a boys' school , where pérola had to hide behind a folding screen so as not to attract the attention of the teacher and the boys.
in 1897, pérola took the entrance exams for the annex course of the law academy of são paulo.
she didn't pass the  geography test and neither was well received by the academics, who did not want to admit women.
in 1899, at the age of 19, byington finished the normal course.
during the first world war, byington was in the united states, where she was responsible for a section of the red cross.
upon returning to brazil, she continued participating in philanthropic activities.
from the 1930s, byington alongside the teacher maria antonieta de castro led a campaign to combat child mortality, called "cruzada pró-infância", (crusade for childhood) a task which she held for 33 years.
she also dedicated herself to several other programs in defense of the disadvantaged, especially children, having been awarded several commendations of merit.
on july 4, 1901, byington married albert jackson byington, an electrical engineer who imported the first electric motor to brazil.
they had two children.
on 6 november 1963, byington died in new york city, new york, united states.
in her honor, a hospital dedicated to women's health in são paulo is named after her.
pérola, a municipality of the state of paraná, was named after her; alberto byington júnior, pérola's son, was one of the partners of the companhia byington de colonização ltda., the company that  bought land and settled in the region.

bad moon is a 1996 canadian-american horror film written and directed by eric red, and produced by james g. robinson.
the film is about a mother and son who are threatened by her brother, who struggles to overcome the curse of lycanthropy.
it stars michael paré, mariel hemingway and mason gamble.
the film is based on the novel thor by wayne smith, which mainly tells the story from the dog's viewpoint.
thor was published in the united states (thomas dunne/st.
martin's press hardback, ballantine paperback), and in the united kingdom, germany, the netherlands, sweden and norway, in english, german, dutch, swedish and norwegian.
bad moon received negative reviews and performed poorly at the box office.
while making love in their tent during a work expedition in nepal, photo-journalists ted harrison and his girlfriend marjorie are attacked by a werewolf.
the werewolf snatches marjorie and ted attempts to rescue her but gets bitten in his shoulder and thrown to the ground.
hurt but determined he crawls to his shotgun and manages to shoot the werewolf's head off but not before the beast kills marjorie.
with the intent of living in isolation ted moves back home into a trailer in the woods hours away from his lawyer sister janet harrison.
one day in an effort to reach out to her and his young nephew brett, ted calls them up and invites them for a meal at his home by the lake.
upon seeing him again the family dog, thor, begins to sense something wrong with "uncle ted" and goes into the woods tracking a smell, which leads him to human remains hanging on a tree branch.
meanwhile, ted tells janet that his girlfriend marjorie broke up with him and returned to her home in seattle, hiding the truth from her, and in an attempt at comforting her brother, janet invites him to stay with them.
shaken and fearful of hurting them, ted declines and janet, brett and thor leave before the sun starts to set, at ted's insistence.
the next day, there is an investigation going on in the woods near ted's trailer where the mangled bodies of several missing hikers and a forest ranger were found.
under fear of being found guilty, ted calls janet and tells her he's changed his mind.
he parks his trailer in her yard in the hopes that in being near his family, he'll be able to control himself.
however, thor is aware of ted's nature and becomes suspicious and eventually hostile towards him.
noticing that he goes out to "jog" at night with handcuffs, thor becomes frenzied until janet lets him out of the house.
tracking his scent, thor follows ted into the woods and finds him turned into a werewolf and tied to a tree while growling, clawing and trying to escape.
meanwhile, janet starts looking for thor and goes into the woods.
aware of her danger, thor manages to find and distract her back to the house before she finds ted.
the next day while making breakfast, janet sees on tv the news coverage on the killings and confronts her brother about not telling her his true reasons for visiting her and invites him to stay permanently.
while brett is watching werewolf of london (mistakenly confused for the wolf man), he and ted discuss werewolves and their existence, with ted stating that it doesn't take a full moon to start the transformation and that he has "been acquainted with a few in his time" and brett states that werewolves don't exist.
while brett throws out the trash, ted tries to warn his sister and advises her to start listening to thor and his sudden change in behavior and drops hints that the murders had been done by a wolf.
she ignores his pleas and he retreats into his trailer where thor follows him, waiting for him until the sun starts to set.
ted encounters a suspicious thor but eventually leaves the trailer with the hopes of chaining himself again.
with the sun setting ted screams for janet to take thor away and when she does he rushes into the woods.
thor is afraid of ted hurting his family and begins to bark until brett lets him out of the house.
he makes his way to the woods to find that ted was too late and wasn't able to handcuff himself and has made his way into the backyard.
werewolf ted attacks thor but the dog fights back which wakes up janet.
werewolf ted is scared away when she turns on the bright deck lights.
janet sees thor's injuries and, fearful of ted's advice, calls the sheriff and goes into ted's trailer to notify him.
she does not find ted but instead finds his werewolf book, gruesome pictures of marjorie's body and some of ted's victims.
she also finds a journal in which ted details his pain and his turmoil with not finding a cure for his "disease" and his hopes of finding peace by his family's side.
werewolf ted seems to lurk outside the trailer but janet leaves safely, shaken but adamant about straightening things out with her brother.
later that night, a "flopsy" who had previously tried to frame thor for a false bite goes into janet and brett's yard with the intent of killing thor but is instead attacked and fatally wounded by werewolf ted.
the next day, the sheriff shows up and questions janet about thor and informs her of the "flopsy's" attack by a wild animal; his mutilated body's been found 100 yards away from her property.
remembering thor's injuries janet asks if the culprit could have been a wolf but the sheriff says no and advises her to give up thor to the dog pound.
not believing thor could be the killer, she confronts ted, who provokes thor to attack him.
as a result, thor is taken to the dog pound.
seemingly more confident and accepting of his bloodlust, ted "marks his territory" by urinating in thor's doghouse (as thor had done to his trailer earlier) and shows hostility towards brett, who feels ted is the reason thor was turned in.
brett pretends to go to sleep but packs his backpack and sneaks out of the house to free thor while janet confronts ted in the woods.
in the woods, ted accuses his sister of not listening to his warnings and knowing the truth all along.
as he begins to transform, janet flees in panic back to the house with werewolf ted on her trail and manages to retrieve a revolver hidden in the kitchen.
meanwhile, brett reaches the dog pound on his bicycle, breaks in and frees thor, who takes off running and gets to the house just as werewolf ted is about to attack janet in.
a vicious fight ensues between them with thor savagely biting and injuring werewolf ted several times and werewolf ted throwing thor across the room and seemingly killing him.
brett, having followed thor and worried about his mother, goes into his room and is strangled and held up by his throat by werewolf ted.
seeing an opportunity, janet fires several rounds into ted, who releases brett and spins from the shots.
hurt but still alive, he growls at the now defenseless janet.
however, thor gets up, gets between them and throws himself on werewolf ted, knocking them both out the window and into the yard.
werewolf ted is severely injured but gets up and retreats into the woods.
though thor is injured as well, he follows werewolf ted and tracks him down until sunrise, where a now human ted emerges from behind a tree bruised, beaten and bloody.
standing his ground and ready to attack, thor whimpers in reluctance, but ted tells him to "do it" and with no more hesitation thor lunges at him and finishes him off.
some time later, janet's house is being repaired and she and brett are seen petting thor, who is bandaged and recovering from the fight.
janet apologizes for blaming him and putting him in the dog pound.
suddenly, thor (as a werewolf) savagely growls at her.
janet wakes up alarmed and quickly realizes it was just a nightmare as she, brett and thor are fine and at peace.
reviews were unfavorable.
rotten tomatoes gives the film a score of 38%, based on 8 reviews.
audiences polled by cinemascore gave the film an average grade of "c+" on an a+ to f scale.
the mpaa rated the film an r for "horror violence and gore, brief language, and a scene of sexuality".
originally, the film was issued an nc-17 rating, so a few seconds of graphic sex and violence were cut from the pre-title sequence.
[citation needed]
the movie made many significant changes from the novel, particularly in the make-up of the family, which in the novel consisted of two parents and three children, as well as the dog, who sees the family as his pack, which must be defended at all costs.
the dog's perceptions of events are treated in great detail, as is the relationship between him and his human family, and his confusion as to whether the werewolf is a threat to his family that must be eliminated, or a pack member who must be respected.
these subtleties mainly did not make it into the film.
the film was released on dvd in a snap case on october 3, 2000. it was released for the first time on blu-ray on july 19, 2016. the blu-ray edition from scream factory (a division of shout factory) featured both the theatrical and director's cuts of the film.
the director's cut is about a minute or so longer, including the additional gore cut in order to receive an r rating.
the blu-ray includes a commentary track by writer-director eric red, new interviews with the actors, red, stunt coordinator ken kirzinger, and special make-up effects artist steve johnson.
the special features also included a selection of storyboards and the theatrical trailer for the film.
"pra não dizer que não falei das flores" (portuguese for "not to say that i haven't spoken about the flowers"), also known as "caminhando" (portuguese for "walking" or "going forward"), is a song composed by geraldo vandré that ranked second in the festival internacional da canção in 1968. although it was the most applauded song of the night and very well received by the public, the music did not guarantee to vandré the prize thanks to orders given the station rede globo by the first army command[citation needed] who condemned the composition because they considered it extremely critical of the government.
the first place prize went to the song "sabiá" (portuguese for "thrush") of tom jobim and chico buarque; the authors ended up being booed for about 23 minutes while the people continued to sing vandré's song.
considered a violation of the sovereignty of the country and a mockery of the armed forces, public playing of the song was forbidden by the brazilian military dictatorship the following day along with the edition of ai-5, and the composer had become one of the most hunted persons in the country.
the general luís de oliveira frança, security secretary, warned that the music would serve as a slogan for the street manifestations hereafter.
all the registers of vandré's presentation at the festival were deleted.
the melody has a hymn and march rhythm, and the lyric, with the verses in an easy rhyme scheme (almost all of them end with the same syllable: "ão", sonding like "oun" from the word "sound" and equivalent to "on" from "nation" in english), to aid memorization, was widely played.
the content of the song was seen as an incentive to resistance and the armed struggle thanks to some verses as:
"in schools, on the streets
fields, buildings
we are all soldiers
armed or not"
"certainty in front
history at hand"
"who knows makes the time
doesn't wait for it to happen"
also, the song was considered an affront by the government, mainly at the part that vandré refers to the "old lesson" that was taught in the barracks; something that was also seen as a reference to the torture inflicted for those accused of subversion, the suspects were commonly taken to police stations and military institutions and were subjected to all kinds of abuse that often ended up victimizing them.
one of the best known critiques of the time came from octavio costa, a general whose article "vandré's flowers" spoke against the public and the singer that won the second place.
at the end of the article, he noted that three injustices were committed that night - one by the jury, one by the public and the last one by vandré - and added that the third could still be repaired.
[citation needed]
after these events, vandré was persecuted.
[citation needed]
one of the most important brazilian songs and an everlasting symbol of the resistance, walking is regarded by many as the true brazilian national hymn.
[citation needed] writer and journalist millôr fernandes supports this hypothesis, saying that it was born during the fight and came being sung emotionally and in a spontaneous way by a large number of people.
[citation needed]
walking is still used to remember the situation that the country was going through at the time and to keep alive the memories of those who were victims of those hard times as occurred recently in the burial of antônio carlos bicalho lana, a 24-year-old student and one of the leaders of major resistance group aln, killed under torture by army officers in 1973.
[citation needed]
artists such as luiz gonzaga and zé ramalho re-recorded the song that was also voted by the brazilian edition of rolling stone as the 28th greatest brazilian song.
euterpe (/juːˈtɜːrpiː/; greek: eὐτέρπη [eu̯térpɛː] "rejoicing well" or "delight", from ancient greek εὖ eu 'well' + τέρπειν terpein 'to please') was one of the muses in greek mythology, presiding over music.
in late classical times, she was named muse of lyric poetry.
she has been called “giver of delight” by ancient poets.
euterpe was born as one of the daughters of mnemosyne, titan goddess of memory, and fathered by zeus, god of the gods.
her sisters include calliope (muse of epic poetry), clio (muse of history), melpomene (muse of tragedy), terpsichore (muse of dancing), erato (muse of erotic poetry), thalia (muse of comedy), polyhymnia (muse of hymns), and urania (muse of astronomy).
sometimes they are referred to as water nymphs having been born from the four sacred springs on helicon which flowed from the ground after pegasus, the winged horse, stamped his hooves on the ground.
along with her sister muses, euterpe was believed to have lived on mt.
olympus where she and her sisters entertained their father and the other olympian gods with their great artistry.
later on, tradition also placed them on mt.
helicon in boeotia where there was a major cult center to the goddesses, or on mt.
parnassus where the castalian spring was a favorite destination for poets and artists.
pindar and other sources (the author of the bibliotheca, and servius), describe the thracian king rhesus, who appears in the iliad, as son of euterpe and the river-god strymon; homer calls him son of eioneus.
her and her sisters’ role was to entertain the gods on mount olympus.
she inspired the development of liberal and fine arts in ancient greece, serving as an inspiration to poets, dramatists, and authors (such as homer).
according to the traditions and beliefs of the ancient greeks musicians would invoke the aid of euterpe to inspire, guide and assist them in their compositions.
this would often take the form of a prayer for divine inspiration from the minor goddess.
the mountain spring on mount parnassus was sacred to euterpe and the other muses.
it flowed between two high rocks above the city of delphi, and in ancient times its sacred waters were introduced into a square stone basin, where they were retained for the use of the pythia, the priests, priestesses, as well as the oracle of apollo.
some people believe that she invented the aulos or double-flute, though most mythographers credit marsyas or athena with its invention.
some say she also invented other wind instruments.
euterpe is often depicted holding a flute in artistic renditions of her.

gastão vidigal is a municipality in the state of são paulo in brazil.
the population is 4,585 (2015 est.)
in an area of 181 km².
the town was settled in the first part of the 20th century, at first under the name brioso.
the municipality was established in 1955 by separating it from nhandeara, and at the same time it was renamed gastão vidigal after a banker who opened a branch of the banco mercantil de são paulo in the town.
the small town produces milk, corn, cotton, and coffee.
"oração" ("prayer") was the portuguese entry in the eurovision song contest 1964, performed in portuguese by antónio calvário.
this was portugal's debut entry in the contest, and consequently the first time the portuguese language had been used.
the song is in the chanson style, popular in the early years of the contest, and takes the form of a prayer.
calvário addresses god and confesses to hurting his lover.
he goes on to beg for forgiveness, even suggesting that love itself may be a punishment.
the song was performed eleventh on the night, following monaco's romuald with "où sont-elles passées" and preceding italy's gigliola cinquetti with "non ho l'età".
at the close of voting, it had received the dreaded nul points, placing 13th (equal last with the germany, switzerland and yugoslavia) in a field of 16.
it was succeeded as portuguese representative at the 1965 contest by simone de oliveira with "sol de inverno".
alberto santos-dumont (brazilian portuguese: [awˈbɛɾtu ˈsɐ̃tus duˈmõ]; 20 july 1873 – 23 july 1932) was a brazilian inventor and aviation pioneer, one of the very few people to have contributed significantly to the development of both lighter-than-air and heavier-than-air aircraft.
the heir of a wealthy family of coffee producers,  santos-dumont dedicated himself to aeronautical study and experimentation in paris, where he spent most of his adult life.in his early career he designed, built, and flew hot air balloons and early dirigibles, culminating in his winning the deutsch de la meurthe prize on 19 october 1901 for a flight that rounded the eiffel tower.he then turned to heavier-than-air machines, and on 23 october 1906 his 14-bis made the first powered heavier-than-air flight in europe to be certified by the aéro-club de france and the fédération aéronautique internationale.his conviction that aviation would usher in an era of worldwide peace and prosperity led him to freely publish his designs and forego patenting his various innovations.
santos-dumont is a national hero in brazil, where it is popularly held that he preceded the wright brothers in demonstrating a practical airplane.
countless roads, plazas, schools, monuments, and airports there are dedicated to him, and his name is inscribed on the tancredo neves pantheon of the fatherland and freedom.he was a member of the brazilian academy of letters from 1931 until his suicide in 1932.
santos-dumont was born on 20 july 1873 in cabangu in the brazilian town of palmira (today named santos dumont) in the state of minas gerais in southeast brazil.
he was the youngest of seven children born to henrique dumont, an engineer of french descent, and francisca de paula santos.
santos-dumont's father managed a coffee plantation on land owned by his wife's family, and later bought land  in ribeirão preto on which he established a plantation of his own.
his extensive use of labor-saving inventions earned him a fortune, and he was known for a time as the "coffee king of brazil."
santos-dumont was fascinated by machinery, and while still a child he learned to drive the plantation's steam tractors and locomotives.
he also read a great deal of the works of jules verne.
he wrote in his autobiography that the dream of flying came to him while contemplating the magnificent skies of brazil from the plantation.
after basic instruction with private tutors, santos-dumont studied for a time at the colégio culto à ciência in campinas, after which he was sent to the colégio morton in são paulo and the escola de minas in minas gerais.
in 1891 santos-dumont's father was partially paralyzed by a fall from a horse.
he sold the plantation and went to europe with his wife and santos-dumont in search of treatment.
in paris, santos-dumont contacted a balloonist with the intention of making an ascent.
the price quoted was 1,200 francs for a two-hour flight, plus payment for any damage caused and for returning the balloon to paris.
this was a considerable sum of money, and santos-dumont decided not to make the flight, reasoning that "if i risk 1,200 francs for an afternoon's pleasure i shall find it either good or bad.
if it is bad the money will be lost.
if it is good i shall want to repeat it and i shall not have the means."
after this he bought a peugeot automobile, which he took with him when he returned to brazil with his parents at the end of the year.
in 1892 the family returned to europe, but henriques felt too ill to continue on to paris from lisbon, and alberto made the journey on his own.
his father's health deteriorated and he decided to return to brazil, where he died on 30 august 1892.
for the next four years alberto lived in paris, studying physics, chemistry, mechanics, and electricity with the help of a private tutor, and returning to brazil for short holidays.
during this period he sold his peugeot, replacing it with a more powerful and faster de dion motor-tricycle.
in 1896 he returned to brazil for a longer period, but began to miss paris and so returned to europe in 1897. before embarking he had bought a copy of an account of salomon andrée's attempt to fly to the north pole by balloon, written by the constructors of the balloon, mm.
lachambre and machuron.
in his biography santos-dumont describes the book as "a revelation", and resolved to make contact with the balloon constructors when he reached paris.
on arrival in paris santos-dumont contacted lachambre and machuron and arranged to make a flight, piloted by alexis machuron.
taking off from vaugirard, the flight lasted nearly two hours during which the balloon travelled 100 km (62 mi), coming down in the grounds of the château de ferrières.
enchanted by the experience, during the train journey back to paris santos-dumont told machuron that he wanted to have a balloon constructed for himself.
before this was completed he gained experience by making a number of demonstration flights for lachambre.
santos-dumont's first balloon design, the brésil, was remarkable for its small size and light weight, with a capacity of only 113 m3 (4,000 cu ft).
in comparison, the balloon in which he had made his first flight had a capacity of 750 m3 (26,000 cu ft).
after numerous balloon flights, santos-dumont turned to the design of steerable balloons, which became known as dirigibles.
these could be propelled through the air rather than drifting along with the wind.
a dirigible powered by an electric motor, la france, capable of flying at around 24 km/h (15 mph) had been successfully flown in 1884 by charles renard and arthur krebs, but their experiments had not progressed due to a lack of funding.his first design was wrecked during its second flight on 29 september 1898, and he had even less luck with his second, which was abandoned after his first attempt to fly it on 11 may 1899.
a major cause of the accidents to his first two airships had been loss of pressure causing the elongated envelope to lose shape, and for his third design he adopted a much shorter and fatter envelope shape, and towards the end of 1899 made a number of successful flights in it.
meanwhile, he had an airship shed complete with its own hydrogen generating plant constructed at the aéro-club de france's flying grounds in the parc saint cloud.
the zenith of his lighter-than-air career came when santos-dumont won the deutsch de la meurthe prize for the first flight from the parc saint cloud to the eiffel tower and back in less than 30 minutes, necessitating an average ground speed of at least 22 km/h (14 mph) to cover the 11 km (6.8 mi) in the allotted time.
to win the deutsch de la meurthe prize santos-dumont decided to build a bigger craft, the no.
5. on 8 august 1901, during one of his attempts, his dirigible began to lose hydrogen, and started to descend and was unable to clear the roof of the trocadero hotel.
santos-dumont was left hanging in the basket from the side of the hotel.
with the help of the paris fire brigade, he climbed to the roof without injury, but the dirigible was a complete loss.
he immediately ordered a replacement to be constructed, the no.6
on 19 october 1901, after several  more attempts, santos-dumont succeeded in making the return flight.
immediately after he reached saint-cloud, a controversy broke out regarding the precise timing of the flight: although he had reached his destination in under 30 minutes there had been a delay of over a minute before his mooring line was picked up.
however a satisfactory compromise was reached, and santos-dumont was eventually given the prize, which he announced would be given to the poor of paris.
an additional  125,000 francs along with a gold medal was voted to him  by the government of his native brazil.
winning the de la meurthe prize made santos-dumont an international celebrity.
he would float his no.
9 baladeuse along paris boulevards at rooftop level, sometimes landing at a cafe for lunch.parisians affectionately dubbed santos-dumont le petit santos.
the fashionable people of the day copied various aspects of his style of dress, from his high collared shirts to his signature panama hat.
in 1904 santos-dumont shipped his new airship no.
7 from paris to st. louis to fly at the louisiana purchase exposition, to compete for the grand prize of $100,000 which was to be given to a flying machine (of any sort) that could make three round-trip flights over a 24 km (15 mile) l-shaped course at an average speed of 20 mph (32 km/h), later reduced to 15 mph (24 km/h).
it was also necessary for the machine to land undamaged not more than 46 m (150 ft) from the starting point.
because he was the best-known aviator at the time, the fair committee went to great lengths to ensure his participation, including modifying the rules.
[citation needed]
in conjunction with this trip he was invited to the white house to meet u.s. president theodore roosevelt.
however, upon arrival in st. louis, santos-dumont found his airship's envelope to be irreparably damaged.
sabotage, although suspected, was never proven.
santos-dumont did not participate in the contest after suspicion of the deed, a repeat of a similar incident in london, began to focus on santos-dumont himself.
he left the fair and returned immediately to france.
[citation needed]
in 1904, after santos-dumont complained to his friend louis cartier about the difficulty of checking his pocket watch during flight, cartier created his first men's wristwatch, thus allowing santos-dumont to check his flight performance while keeping both hands on the controls.cartier still markets a line of santos-dumont watches and sunglasses.
although santos-dumont continued to work on non-rigid airships, his primary interest soon turned to heavier-than-air aircraft.
by 1905, he had finished his first fixed-wing aircraft design, and also a helicopter.
santos-dumont finally succeeded in flying a heavier-than-air aircraft on 23 october 1906, piloting the 14-bis before a large crowd of witnesses at the grounds of paris' château de bagatelle in the bois de boulogne for a distance of 60 metres (197 ft) at a height of about five meters (16 ft).
this was the first flight of a powered heavier-than-air machine in europe to be certified by the aéro-club de france, and won the deutsch-archdeacon prize for the first officially observed flight of more than 25 meters.
on 12 november 1906 santos-dumont set the first world record recognized by the federation aeronautique internationale, by flying 220 metres (722 ft) in 21.5 seconds.
on that date he became the first person to be filmed in an airplane in flight.
as late as 1906 he was reported as stating that the wright brothers claim to have flown for thirty miles was mere bluff.
santos-dumont's final design were the demoiselle monoplanes (nos.
19 to 22).
these aircraft were used by dumont for personal transport.
the fuselage consisted of three specially reinforced bamboo booms, and the pilot sat a seat between the main wheels of a tricycle landing gear.
the demoiselle was controlled in flight by a tail unit that functioned both as elevator and rudder, and by wing warping (no.
20).
in 1908 santos-dumont started working with adolphe clément's clement-bayard company to mass-produce the demoiselle no 19. they planned a production run of 100 units, built 50 but sold only 15, for 7,500 francs for each airframe.
it was the world's first series production aircraft.
by 1909 it was offered with a choice of three engines: clement 20 hp; wright 4-cyl 30 hp (clement-bayard had the license to manufacture wright engines) and clement-bayard 40 hp designed by pierre clerget.
the demoiselle could achieve a  speed of 120 km/h.
the demoiselle could be constructed in only 15 days.
possessing a good performance, flying at a speed of more than 100 km/h, the demoiselle was the last aircraft designed by santos-dumont.
the june 1910 edition of the popular mechanics magazine published drawings of the demoiselle and stated, "this machine is better than any other which has ever been built, for those who wish to reach results with the least possible expense and with a minimum of experimenting."
american companies sold drawings and parts for demoiselles for several years afterward.

– eduardo das neves, "the conquest of air" (1902)
santos-dumont's final flight as a pilot was made in a demoiselle on 4 january 1910. the flight ended when a bracing wire snapped at an altitude of about 25 m (80 ft), causing a wing to collapse.
santo-dumont suffered only bruises.
in march 1910 santos-dumont announced that he was retiring from aviation.
he secluded himself in his house and it was rumoured that he was suffering from a nervous breakdown caused by overwork, but it is probable that he was depressed about the multiple sclerosis from which he was later known to suffer.
in 1911 he moved to the french seaside village of bénerville (now benerville-sur-mer), where he took up astronomy as a hobby.
after the outbreak of war in 1914 his german-made telescope and unusual accent led to accusations he was a german spy tracking french naval activity, and his rooms searched by french police.
upset by the allegation and depressed about his illness santos-dumont burned all his papers and plans.
for this reason there is little direct information available about his designs today.
he spent much of the 1920s in swiss and french sanatoria, though returning to brazil at times.
for his arrival in brazil on the luxury liner cap arcona in 1928, a dozen members of the brazilian scientific community boarded a seaplane with the intention of paying him a flying welcome.
the plane crashed with the loss of all on board; santos-dumont's growing despondency deepened even further, and he returned to switzerland.
in 1931 santos-dumont's nephew went to switzerland and took him back to brazil.seriously ill and said to be depressed both by his multiple sclerosis and also the use of aircraft in warfare during são paulo's constitutionalist revolution, he hanged himself on 23 july 1932, three days after his 59th birthday, in the city of guarujá (although his death certificate gives the cause of death as "cardiac collapse").
after lying in state for two days in the crypt of são paulo cathedral, his body was taken to rio de janeiro, where after a state funeral he was buried in the são joão batista cemetery.his heart is preserved in a golden globe at brazil's national air and space museum.
santos-dumont, a lifelong bachelor, appeared to have a particular affection for a married cuban-american woman named aida de acosta, who in 1903 became the only other person that he ever permitted to fly one of his airships – his no.
9. until the end of his life, he kept a picture of her on his desk alongside a vase of fresh flowers.
nonetheless, there is no indication that santos-dumont and acosta stayed in touch after her flight; upon his death she was reported as saying that she hardly knew him.
santos-dumont is also known to not only have often used an equal sign (=) between his two surnames in place of a hyphen, but also seems to have preferred that practice, to display equal respect for his french and brazilian-portuguese ethnicities.
in brazil, during 1918 santos-dumont bought a small lot on the side of a hill in the city of petrópolis, in the mountains near rio de janeiro, and in 1918 built a small house there filled with imaginative mechanical gadgetry including an alcohol-fueled heated shower of his own design.
the hill was purposefully chosen because of its great steepness as a proof that ingenuity could make it possible to build a comfortable house in that unlikely site.
after building it, he used to spend his summers there to escape the heat in rio, calling it a encantada ("the enchanted") after its street, rua do encanto.
the treads of the exterior stairs are hollowed alternately on the right and left, to enable people to climb them comfortably.
the house is now a museum.
it is popularly believed in brazil that santos-dumont preceded the wright brothers in demonstrating a practical airplane.

t5 (formerly directv-5) is a dormant communications satellite launched from baikonur cosmodrome, kazakhstan in may, 2002 to provide mainly spanish language satellite television programs to directv customers from the 119 degrees west longitudinal orbit.
it was built by space systems/loral, as part of its ls-1300 line.
in may 2004, directv successfully launched directv 7s (later t7s), their second high powered spot beam.
t7s is located at the 119 degree orbital slot.
the satellite was renamed to t5 in 2017.
t5 was originally known as tempo 1, and was originally intended for satellite provider askyb, who later sold the satellites to primestar in the process of going out of business.
primestar's other satellite, tempo 2 (later directv-6) was launched in 1997, while tempo 1 was stored until the company and both satellites were purchased by directv.
directv eventually launched the tempo 1 satellite after years of delays as the directv-5 satellite in 2002. in 2015, the satellite was renamed to t5, after at&t purchased directv and took over operations of the satellite fleet.
t5 is located at 109.8°w and provided channels for the puerto rico market.0°00′n 109°48′w  /  0°n 109.8°w  / 0; -109.8due to directv’s decision to remove the 110° position from its fleet, t5 stopped broadcasting almost all of its channels sometime in 2019 and is currently dormant.
despite this, the satellite remains in geostationary orbit.
the only channel currently being broadcast from t5 is a directv info card channel, telling people to upgrade their equipment.
alfonso xiii (17 may 1886 – 28 february 1941), also known as el africano or the african, was king of spain from 1886 until the proclamation of the second republic in 1931. alfonso was monarch from birth as his father, alfonso xii, had died the previous year.
alfonso's mother, maria christina of austria, served as regent until he assumed full powers on his sixteenth birthday in 1902.
during alfonso's reign of the kingdom of spain, it experienced four major problems that contributed to the end of the liberal monarchy: the lack of real political representation of broad social groups; the poor situation of the popular classes, especially peasants; problems arising from the rif war; and catalan nationalism.
the political and social turbulence that began with the spanish–american war prevented the turnaround parties from establishing a true liberal democracy, which led to the establishment of the dictatorship of miguel primo de rivera.
with the political failure of the dictatorship, alfonso impelled a return to the democratic normality with the intention of regenerating the regime.
nevertheless, it was abandoned by all political classes, as they felt betrayed by the king's support of the dictatorship of primo de rivera.
he left spain voluntarily after the municipal elections of april 1931, which were taken as a plebiscite on abolishing the monarchy.
alfonso was born at royal palace of madrid in madrid on 17 may 1886. he was the posthumous son of alfonso xii of spain, who had died in november 1885, and became king of spain upon his birth.
just after he was born, he was carried naked to the spanish prime minister on a silver tray.
five days later he was carried in a solemn court procession with a golden fleece round his neck and was baptized with water specially brought from the river jordan in palestine.
the french newspaper le figaro described the young king in 1889 as "the happiest and best-loved of all the rulers of the earth".
his mother, maria christina of austria, served as his regent until his 16th birthday.
during the regency, in 1898, spain lost its colonial rule over cuba, puerto rico, guam and the philippines to the united states as a result of the spanish–american war.
when he came of age in may 1902, the week of his majority was marked by festivities, bullfights, balls and receptions throughout spain.
he took his oath to the constitution before members of the cortes on 17 may.
by 1905, alfonso was looking for a suitable consort.
on a state visit to the united kingdom, he stayed at buckingham palace with king edward vii.
there he met princess victoria eugenie of battenberg, the daughter of edward's youngest sister princess beatrice, and a granddaughter of queen victoria.
he found her attractive, and she returned his interest.
there were obstacles to the marriage.
victoria was a protestant, and would have to become a catholic.
victoria's brother leopold was a haemophiliac, so there was a 50 percent chance that victoria was a carrier of the trait.
finally, alfonso's mother maria christina wanted him to marry a member of her family, the house of habsburg-lorraine, or some other catholic princess, as she considered the battenbergs to be non-dynastic.
victoria was willing to change her religion, and her being a haemophilia carrier was only a possibility.
maria christina was eventually persuaded to drop her opposition.
in january 1906 she wrote an official letter to princess beatrice proposing the match.
victoria met maria christina and alfonso in biarritz, france, later that month, and converted to catholicism in san sebastián in march.
in may, diplomats of both kingdoms officially executed the agreement of marriage.
alfonso and victoria were married at the royal monastery of san jerónimo in madrid on 31 may 1906, with british royalty in attendance, including victoria's cousins the prince and princess of wales (later king george v and queen mary).
the wedding was marked by an assassination attempt on alfonso and victoria by catalan anarchist mateu morral.
as the wedding procession returned to the palace, he threw a bomb from a window which killed or injured many bystanders and members of the procession.
on 10 may 1907, the couple's first child, alfonso, prince of asturias, was born.
however, victoria was in fact a haemophilia carrier, and alfonso inherited the condition.
neither of the two daughters born to the king and queen were haemophilia carriers, but another of their sons, gonzalo (1914–1934), had the condition.
alfonso distanced himself from his wife for transmitting the condition to their sons.
from 1914 on, he had several mistresses, and fathered five illegitimate children.
a sixth illegitimate child had been born before his marriage.
during world war i, because of his family connections with both sides and the division of popular opinion, spain remained neutral.
the king established an office for assistance to prisoners of war on all sides.
this office used the spanish diplomatic and military network abroad to intercede for thousands of pows – transmitting and receiving letters for them, and other services.
the office was located in the royal palace.
alfonso became gravely ill during the 1918 flu pandemic.
spain was neutral and thus under no wartime censorship restrictions, so his illness and subsequent recovery were reported to the world, while flu outbreaks in the belligerent countries were concealed.
this gave the misleading impression that spain was the most-affected area and led to the pandemic being dubbed "the spanish flu."
following world war i, spain entered the lengthy yet victorious rif war (1920–1926) to preserve its colonial rule over northern morocco.
critics of the monarchy thought the war was an unforgivable loss of money and lives, and nicknamed alfonso el africano ("the african").
alfonso had not acted as a strict constitutional monarch, and supported the africanists who wanted to conquer for spain a new empire in africa to compensate for the lost empire in the americas and asia.
the rif war had starkly polarized spanish society between the africanists who wanted to conquer an empire in africa vs. the abandonistas who wanted to abandon morocco as not worth the blood and treasure.
alfonso liked to play favourites with his generals, and one of his most favored generals was manuel fernández silvestre.
in 1921, when silvestre advanced up into the rif mountains of morocco, alfonso sent him a telegram whose first line read "hurrah for real men!
", urging silvestre not to retreat at a time when silvestre was experiencing major difficulties.
silvestre stayed the course, leading his men into the battle of annual, one of spain's worst defeats.
alfonso, who was on holiday in the south of france at the time, was informed of the "disaster of the annual" while he was playing golf.
reportedly, alfonso's response to the news was to shrug his shoulders and say "chicken meat is cheap", before resuming his game of golf.
alfonso remained in france and did not return to spain to comfort the families of the soldiers lost at the "disaster of the annual", which many people at the time saw as a callous and cold act, a sign that the king couldn't care less about the lives of his soldiers.
in 1922, the cortes started an investigation into the responsibility for the annual disaster and soon discovered evidence that the king had been one of the main supporters of silvestre's advance into the rif mountains.
after the "disaster of the annual", spain's war in the rif went from bad to worse, and as the spanish were barely hanging onto morocco, support for the abandonistas grew as many people could see no point to the war.
in august 1923, spanish soldiers embarking for morocco mutinied, other soldiers in malaga simply refused to board the ships that were to take them to morocco, while in barcelona huge crowds of left-wingers had staged anti-war protests at which spanish flags were burned while the flag of the rif republic was waved about.
with the africanists comprising only a minority, it was clear that it was only a matter of time before the abandonistas forced the spanish to give up on the rif, which was part of the reason for the military coup d'état later in 1923. on september 13, 1923, general miguel primo de rivera, seized power in a military coup.
he ruled as a dictator with alfonso's support until 1930. it is believed that one of alfonso's main reasons for supporting the coup was his desire to suppress the publication of the damning cortes report into the annual disaster.
the poetic generation of '27 as well as catalan and basque nationalism grew in this era.
on 28 january 1930, amid economic problems, general unpopularity and an impending putschist plot led by general manuel goded (of which alfonso xiii was most probably aware), miguel primo de rivera was forced to resign, exiling to paris (only to die a weeks later of the complication of a diagnosed diabetes in combination with the effects of a flu).
alfonso xiii appointed general dámaso berenguer as new prime minister, leading to the period known as the dictablanda.
the king had so closely associated with the primo de rivera dictatorship that it was difficult for him to distance himself from the regime he had supported for almost seven years.
the enforced changes relied on the incorrect assumption that spaniards were going to accept nothing has happened after 1923 and that going back to the prior state of things was possible.
in april 1931, general josé sanjurjo told him even the army was not loyal.
[citation needed] on 12 april, the republican parties won a landslide victory in the 1931 municipal elections, perceived as a plebiscite on monarchy.
alfonso left the country on 14 april as the second spanish republic was proclaimed, but did not formally abdicate.
he eventually settled in rome.
by a law of 26 november 1931, alfonso was accused by the cortes of high treason.
this law would later be repealed by a new law dated 15 december 1938, signed by francisco franco.
in 1933, his two eldest sons, alfonso and jaime, renounced their claims to the defunct throne, and in 1934 his youngest son gonzalo died.
this left his third son juan, count of barcelona his only male heir.
juan later was the father of juan carlos i.
when the army rose up against the democratically elected republican government  and war broke out, alfonso made it clear he favoured the "nationalist" military rebels against the republic.
but in september 1936 the nationalist leader, general francisco franco, declared that the nationalists would not restore alfonso as king.
(the nationalist army included many carlist supporters of a rival pretender.)
nevertheless, alfonso sent his son juan to spain in 1936, to participate in the uprising.
however, general mola had juan arrested near the french border and expelled from the country.
on 29 september 1936, upon the death of infante alfonso carlos, duke of san jaime (the carlist pretender), alfonso also became the senior heir of hugh capet and so was hailed by some french legitimists as king alphonse i of france and navarre.
on 15 january 1941, alfonso xiii renounced his rights to the defunct spanish throne in favour of juan.
he died in rome on 28 february of that year.
in spain, the caudillo franco ordered three days of national mourning.
his funeral was held in rome in the church of santa maria degli angeli e dei martiri.
alfonso was buried in the church of santa maria in monserrato degli spagnoli, the spanish national church in rome, immediately below the tombs of popes callixtus iii and alexander vi.
in january 1980 his remains were transferred to el escorial in spain.
alfonso was a promoter of tourism in spain.
the need for the lodging of his wedding guests prompted the construction of the luxurious hotel palace in madrid.
he also supported the creation of a network of state-run lodges, paradores, in historic buildings of spain.
his fondness for the sport of football led to the patronage of several "royal" ("real" in spanish) football clubs, the first being real club deportivo de la coruña in 1907. selected others include real madrid, real sociedad, real betis, real unión, espanyol and real zaragoza.
an avenue in the northern madrid neighbourhood of chamartín, avenida de alfonso xiii, is named after him.
a plaza or town center in iloilo city, philippines (now plaza libertad) was named in his honour called plaza alfonso xiii.
a street in merthyr tydfil, in wales, was built especially to house spanish immigrants in the mining industry and named alphonso street after alfonso xiii.
alfonso xiii appears as "king buby" in luis coloma's story of ratoncito pérez (1894), which was written for the king when he was 8 years old.
the story of ratoncito pérez has been adapted into further literary works and movies since then, with the character of alfonso xiii appearing in some.
alfonso xiii is also mentioned on the plaque to ratoncito pérez on the second floor of "la calle del arenal".

antonio cánovas del castillo (8 february 1828 – 8 august 1897) was a spanish politician and historian known principally for serving six terms as spanish prime minister, his role in supporting the restoration of the bourbon monarchy to the spanish throne and for his death at the hands of an anarchist, michele angiolillo.
born in málaga as the son of antonio cánovas garcía and juana del castillo y estébanez,  cánovas moved to madrid after the death of his father where he lived with his mother's cousin, the writer serafín estébanez calderón.
although he studied law at the university of madrid, he showed an early interest in politics and spanish history.
his active involvement in politics dates to the 1854 revolution, led by general leopoldo o'donnell, when he drafted the manifesto of manzanares, which accompanied the military overthrow of the sitting government, laid out the political goals of the movement, and played a critical role as it attracted the masses' support when the coup seemed to fail.
during the final years of isabel ii, he served in a number of posts, including a diplomatic mission to rome, governor of cádiz, and director general of local administration.
that period of his political career culminated in his being twice made a government minister, first taking the interior portfolio in 1864 and then the overseas territories portfolio in 1865 to 1866. after the 1868 glorious revolution (revolución gloriosa), he retired from the government, but he was a strong supporter of the restoration of the bourbon monarchy during the first spanish republic (1873–1874) and as the leader of the conservative minority in the cortes, he declaimed against universal suffrage and freedom of religion.
he also drafted the manifesto of sandhurst [es] and prevailed upon alfonso xii to issue it, just as he had done years previously with o'donnell.
cánovas returned to active politics with the 1874 overthrow of the republic by general martínez campos and the elevation of isabell ii's son alfonso xii to the throne.
he served as prime minister (primer presidente del consejo de ministros) for six years starting in 1874 (although he was twice briefly replaced in 1875 and 1879).
he was a principal author of the spanish constitution of 1876, which formalised the constitutional monarchy that had resulted from the restoration of alfonso and limited suffrage to reduce the political influence of the working class and assuage the voting support from the wealthy minority becoming the protected status quo.
cánovas del castillo played a key role in bringing an end to the last carlist threat to bourbon authority (1876) by merging a group of dissident carlist deputies with his own conservative party.
[specify] more significantly, his term in office saw the victory achieved by the governmental spanish troops in the third carlist war, the occupation of the basque territory and the decree establishing an end to the centuries-long basque specific status (july 1876) that resulted in its annexation to a centralist spain.
against a backdrop of martial law imposed across the basque provinces (and possibly navarre), heated negotiations with liberal basque high-ranking officials led to the establishment of the first basque economic agreement (1878).
an artificial two-party system designed to reconcile the competing militarist, catholic and carlist power bases led to an alternating prime ministership (known as the turno pacifico) with the progressive práxedes mateo sagasta after 1881. he also assumed the functions of the head of state during the regency of maría cristina after alfonso's death in 1885.
by the late 1880s, cánovas' policies were under threat from two sources.
first, his overseas policy was increasingly untenable.
a policy of repression against cuban nationalists was ultimately ineffective and spain's authority was challenged most seriously by the 1895 rebellion led by josé martí.
spain's policy against cuban independence brought her increasingly into conflict with the united states, an antagonism that culminated in the spanish–american war of 1898. second, the political repression of spain's working class was growing increasingly troublesome, and pressure for expanded suffrage mounted amid widespread discontent with the cacique system of electoral manipulation.
cánovas' policies included mass arrests and a policy of torture:
during a religious procession in 1896, at barcelona, a bomb was thrown.
immediately three hundred men and women were arrested.
some were anarchists, but the majority were trade unionists and socialists.
they were thrown into the notorious prison at the fortress of montjuïc in barcelona and tortured.
after a number had been killed, or had gone insane, their cases were taken up by the liberal press of europe, resulting in the release of a few survivors.reputedly it was cánovas del castillo who ordered the torture, including the burning of the victims' flesh, the crushing of their bones, and the cutting out of their tongues.
similar acts of brutality and barbarism had occurred during his regime in cuba, and canovas remained deaf to the appeals and protests of civilized conscience.
at the same time, cánovas remained an active man of letters.
his historical writings earned him a considerable reputation, particularly his history of the decline of spain (historia de la decadencia de españa) for which he was elected at the young age of 32 to the real academia de la historia in 1860. that was followed by elevation to other bodies of letters, including the real academia española in 1867, the academia de ciencias morales y políticas in 1871 and the real academia de bellas artes de san fernando in 1887. he also served as the head of the athenaeum in madrid (1870–74, 1882–84 and 1888–89).
in 1897, he was shot dead by michele angiolillo, an italian anarchist, at the spa santa águeda, in mondragón, guipúzcoa.
he thus did not live to see spain's loss of her final colonies to the united states after the spanish–american war.
he married maría de la concepción espinosa de los monteros y rodrigo de villamayor on 20 october 1860; he widowed on 3 september 1863. he married joaquina de osma y zavala on 14 november 1887. no progeny survived him.
cánovas was the chief architect of the restoration regime, that strived for bringing stability to the spanish society.
it has been emphasized that the two figures most influential to his political ideas were edmund burke (from whom he derived a brand of traditionalism  with a historicist rather than religious matrix) and joaquín francisco pacheco.
cánovas embraced an essentialist, metaphysical and providentialist conception of the nation.
a staunch opponent to universal suffrage, he held the view that "universal suffrage begets socialism in a natural, necessary and inevitable way".
the policies of repression and political manipulation that cánovas made a cornerstone of his government helped foster the nationalist movements in both catalonia and the basque provinces and set the stage for labour unrest during the first two decades of the 20th century.
the disastrous colonial policy not only led to the loss of spain's remaining colonial possessions in the pacific and caribbean but also seriously weakened the government at home.
a failed postwar coup by camilo de polavieja set off a long period of political instability, which ultimately led to the collapse of the monarchy and the dissolution of the constitution that cánovas had authored.
his white marble mausoleum was carved by agustí querol subirats at the panteón de hombres ilustres, in madrid.

eduardo rosales gallinas (4 november 1836 – 13 september 1873) was a spanish painter.
he was an adherent of the italian-based art movement known as "purismo" and specialized in historical scenes.
he was born in madrid.
the second son of a minor official, he began his education in a private school operated by the escolapios.
he was orphaned as a teenager and enrolled in the real academia de bellas artes de san fernando, where he studied under federico de madrazo in 1851.
rosales accompanied some friends to rome in 1857, without a fellowship or other financial support, until he received a special stipend from the government to continue his studies in 1861. he joined a group of spanish painters who gathered in the antico caffè greco, which included josé casado del alisal, dióscoro puebla and marià fortuny.
there he began to associate with followers of the nazarene movement, but soon abandoned his interest in them and produced his first important work "tobías y el angel".
however, he continued to be interested in developing a more realistic style, which was achieved in his best known work "doña isabel la católica dictando su testamento".
he took it to the international exposition (1867) in paris and later returned to rome, where he sent a telegram to his friends martín rico and raimundo de madrazo telling them that the painting had been an outstanding success, taking the first gold medal for work by a foreigner.
he was also named a chevalier in the legion d'honneur.
he married his cousin maximina in 1868. they had two children, one of whom, eloisa, died in infancy and was memorialized in his painting "primeros pasos" (first steps).
rosales was in poor health himself, having had tuberculosis for many years, and made frequent visits to panticosa in the pyrenees, where the water was famous for its curative properties.
in 1869, he left rome for good and opened a studio in madrid.
the harsh criticism he received for his work "la muerte de lucrecia" (1871) left him discouraged and he never painted another large-scale canvas.
the following year, hoping to find a climate that would more amenable to his health, he moved to murcia.
upon the declaration of the first spanish republic, he was offered positions at the museo del prado, which he rejected, and at the new academia de españa en roma [es], which he accepted but never filled, due to his worsening condition.
he died shortly thereafter, in madrid.
in 1922, madrid honored him with a memorial statue, sculpted by mateo inurria and placed on a street named after him, the paseo del pintor rosales.

rajgruha (alternative spelling: rajgraha and rajgriha) is a memorial and house of the leader b. r. ambedkar at hindu colony of dadar in mumbai, india.
it was named rajgriha (now rajgir) in reference to the ancient buddhist kingdom.
the ground floor of the three-story building hosts a heritage museum, as a memorial to the indian leader.
this place is a holy site for indians, especially ambedkarite buddhists and dalits.
ambedkar lived at rajgruha for 15-20 years.
millions of people visit the site before the chaitya bhoomi in shivaji park on 6 december.
ambedkar collected more than 50,000 books during his time at rajgruha, which made it one of the largest personal libraries in the world at the time of his death.
plans to designate the building as a national monument fell through due to legal and technical issues, but in 2013 the mansion became a heritage monument.
babasaheb ambedkar was born into abject poverty.
by 1930, however, his financial situation improved as he became a well-known barrister.
ambedkar's legal office was near damodar hall in parel.
eventually ambedkar's house at paybadevi could no longer accommodate his growing book collection, so he decided to build a new house for himself and his family.
ambedkar planned for his new home to have a library.
in the new structure, two blocks of three rooms were built on the ground floor of the rajgruha.
in those two blocks, his family live.
on the first floor of the royal house, he arranged his library and office.
in 1930, he owned two plots on each of 99th and 129th streets, and a 55 square yard area in dadar, a hindu colony of mumbai.
at 129th street in the fifth lane, he decided to build a house for his family, while he constructed a rental building on the 99th plot in the third lane.
he received a loan from the central bank of india.
mr. aaiskar supervised construction.
in january 1931, the construction of the building on plot number 129 began and was completed in 1933. construction of another building on plot 99 started in 1932. after finishing the construction, they named the building "char minar".
the name "rajgruha" was related to buddhist culture and hindu culture, whereas the name "char minar" was related to muslim culture.
in 1933, ambedkar, along with his family, moved in.
b. r. ambedkar, his wife ramabai, son yashwant, laxmibai (wife of his brother), mukund (his nephew), etc.
lived there.
on 9 may 1941, he sold the char minar building to pay for the purchase of books and retire outstanding loans.
however, he kept the house of rajgruha as a permanent possession.
león felipe camino galicia (11 april 1884 – 17 september 1968) was an anti-fascist spanish poet.
felipe was born in tábara, zamora, spain, while his parents were on travel.
his father was a notary public, and consequently very well off.
his family established in santander.
later on, felipe would study pharmacy and start a business as a pharmacist, mostly to amuse his father.
however, literature was stronger and he eloped with an itinerant theatre troupe.
as a result, he was charged with fraud, due to the bankruptcy caused by his abandonment of business, and spent two years in jail.
when he gained freedom, he started writing for literary reviews and later on his first books were published.
he is one of the best contemporary poets of spanish literature, and scholars have counted him among the generation of year 27.
he fought in the spanish civil war for the spanish republican army against the nationalist faction.
in 1938 he left spain and began a voluntary exile in mexico, where he died.
his poetry touched upon the difficult spanish situation and the feeling that history would repeat itself for the worst.
his use of reiteration or repetition and the use of the verse in the biblical fashion brought him close to the works of walt whitman with a biblical and hebrew flavor (antología rota, 1947).
his poetry also has characteristics of the modernismo and the vanguardismo movements (drop a star, 1933).
his poetry lacks rhyme.
he lived the last years of his life in mexico, where he became a central character of the post war spanish exiles.
there he met actress and singer sara montiel, for whom he felt a great attraction.
he died in mexico city on 17 september 1968.
seven of leon felipe's poems were found in a notebook that che guevara was carrying when he was captured by the bolivian army and the cia.

monuments to herzen and ogaryov on mokhovaya street (russian: памятники герцену и огарёву на моховой улице) were installed in moscow on mokhovaya street in front of the old building of moscow state university (mokhovaya street, 11) and form a single ensemble.
they were opened in 1922. the authors of the monuments are the sculptor n. a. andreev and the architect v. d. kokorin.
in august 1919 the sculptor n. a. andreev was commissioned to make a monument to the democrat, philosopher and publicist a. i. herzen on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of his death.
this monument was supposed to be set january 20, 1920 in front of the building of moscow state university.
since the monument was originally planned to be installed on the site of the recently restored grid, the people's commissariat of education opposed this.
then andreev suggested making two monuments - to herzen and ogaryov, by placing them in the depths of the square on both sides of the entrance.
the time allotted to work was very tight, so n. a. andreev attracted his brother, the sculptor v. a. andreev, to help.
however, even the two of them failed to meet the deadline, and in january 1920, only the laying of monuments took place.
the monuments were discovered only on december 10, 1922 within the framework of the leninist plan of monumental propaganda.
monuments are made of concrete with marble chips.
a. i. herzen is depicted standing full-length with arms crossed on his chest.
on his right shoulder he has a cloak, which falls with decorative folds.
n. p. ogarev is depicted full-length with a winglet, thrown over a bent right hand.
in addition to this paired monument, in moscow there is a later monument to herzen on tverskoy boulevard, as well as a monument to the oath of herzen and ogaryov on sparrow hills.

the monument to friedrich engels (russian: памятник фридриху энгельсу) was installed in 1976 in moscow near the metro station "kropotkinskaya".
the authors of the monument are sculptor i. i. kozlovsky, architects a. a. zavarzin and a. a. usachev.
the monument has the status of an identified cultural heritage site.
in 1972, on the occasion of the visit of us president richard nixon to the ussr, "dilapidated" streets ostozhenka and prechistenka were demolished dilapidated houses, and in their place a square was laid out.
originally, the square had to be larger, however, since the "dilapidated" buildings on the site of the square were of obvious historical value, a local scandal arose among the moscow intelligentsia, which resulted in the authorities' consent to the reduction of the square of the square and the restoration of the white and red chambers immediately behind it.
as a result, the square became too modest, after which, according to the decision of the central committee of the cpsu and the council of ministers of the ussr, it was decided to erect a monument to friedrich engels, a german philosopher and one of the founders of marxism.
november 2, 1976, on the eve of the 59th anniversary of the october revolution, the monument was opened with a large crowd of people.
the first secretary of the cpsu mgk v. v. grishin, the secretary of the cpsu central committee mikhail v. zimyanin, the chairman of the moscow city council v. f. promyslov, the deputy minister of culture of the ussr v. v. voronkov, the ambassador of the gdr to the ussr g. ott (german) russian.
and other officials.
vv grishin cut the scarlet ribbon, after which a coverlet fell from the monument and the hymn of the soviet union sounded.
at the meeting, the director of the institute of marxism-leninism of the central committee of the cpsu, academician a. g. egorov, hero of socialist labor metrostroevets p. a. novozhilov and a student of moscow state university t. yu.
zuikova.
since the monument is located next to the metro station "kropotkinskaya" on the former kropotkinskaya square (now the area of prechistenskie vorota), many muscovites mistake him for the monument to kropotkin.
the bronze sculpture of friedrich engels 6 m high is installed on a cubic monolith-pedestal made of red granite.
the monument stands in the center of the round in terms of a platform paved with stone slabs and framed by a low granite fence, supplemented by semicircular benches.
from the area of prechistenskie gates to the monument leads a semicircular front staircase.
friedrich engels is shown in full growth with his arms crossed on his chest.
the sculptor sought to convey the image of engels in the 1870s, when he, together with karl marx, led the international working-class movement.
the monument and the playground around it practically completely absorbed the park, as a result of which the latter is not marked especially on the maps of moscow and does not have its own name.
the lenin monument on pavlovskaya street (russian: памятник ленину на павловской улице) was installed in 1967 in moscow in the park on pavlovskaya street in front of the moscow electromechanical plant named after vladimir ilyich lenin.
not far from this place, on august 30, 1918, an attempt was made on his life.
the sculptor of the monument was v.b.
topuridze and the architect k.t.
topuridze.
the monument has the status of an object of cultural heritage of federal significance.
lenin repeatedly visited the mikhelson plant, where he spoke before the workers.
here, on august 30, 1918, an attempt was made on him, as a result of which he was seriously wounded.
in 1922, on the site of this attempt, plant workers installed a memorial stone of red polished granite.
on the front side are inscribed the words: "the first stone of the monument on the site of an attempt on the life of the leader of the world proletariat, vladimir lenin.
august 30, 1918 – november 1, 1922".
the inscription on the reverse side reads: "let the oppressed of the whole world know that at this point the bullet of the capitalist counterrevolution tried to interrupt the life and work of the leader of the world proletariat, vladimir ilich lenin".
november 7, 1947 in the square in front of the plant near the monument to a monument was erected a granite monument to v. i. lenin sculptor s. d. merkurov and architect a. zhukov.
in 1960, to the 90th anniversary of the birth of lenin, the square around the monument was significantly expanded.
in 1967, a monument to the work of sd merkurov was moved to the territory of the plant, and in its place the present monument to the sculptor v. b. topuridze and architect kt topuridze was installed.
the present monument to lenin on pavlovskaya street was established on the initiative of the old bolsheviks of the plant named after vladimir ilyich.
the sculptor and architect worked on the monument directly in one of the workshops of the plant, where they were consulted by veterans who personally attended lenin's speeches.
workers of the plant named after vladimir ilyich made all forms for sculpture, which were then sent to the leningrad plant "monument sculpture" for bronze casting.
the monument to lenin was inaugurated on november 1, 1967, on the eve of the 50th anniversary of the october revolution.
five-meter bronze sculpture is installed on a high granite pedestal.
lenin is depicted in full in a coat and cap.
persian columns or persepolitan columns are the distinctive form of column developed in the achaemenid architecture of ancient persia, probably beginning shortly before 500 bce.
they are mainly known from persepolis, where the massive main columns have a base, fluted shaft, and a double-animal capital, most with bulls.
achaemenid palaces had enormous hypostyle halls called apadana, which were supported inside by several rows of columns.
the throne hall or "hall of a hundred columns" at persepolis, measuring 70 x 70 metres was built by the achaemenid king artaxerxes i.  the apadana hall is even larger.
these often included a throne for the king and were used for grand ceremonial assemblies; the largest at persepolis and susa could fit ten thousand people at a time.
the achaemenids had little experience of stone architecture, but were able to import artists and craftsmen from around their empire to develop a hybrid imperial style drawing on influences from greece, mesopotamia, egypt and lydia in anatolia, as well as elam in persia itself.
the style was probably developed in the palace of darius in susa, but the most numerous and complete survivals are at persepolis, where several columns remain standing.
imperial building in the style stopped abruptly with the invasion by alexander the great in 330 bce, when persepolis was burned down.
the forms of the columns and capitals vary somewhat between different buildings.
generally the capitals are carved with two heavily decorated back-to-back animals projecting out from the column.
these function as brackets to support the architrave or roof timbers, while the flat backs of the animals support timbers running at right angles (see the reconstruction in the louvre below).
as they project the animals may be called protomes.
the bull is the most common animal, but there are also lions, bulls with the head of a man in the style of the assyrian lamassu, and griffins with the heads of eagles and the bodies of lions.
the bulls and lions may reflect the symbolism around nowruz, the persian new year at the spring equinox, of an eternally fighting bull personifying the moon, and a lion personifying the sun.
this was the day when tributary nations presented their annual tribute to the king, as depicted in the stairway reliefs at persepolis, and it has been suggested that persepolis was specifically built for nowruz celebrations.
the capital is much longer than in most other styles of columns.
while some smaller columns move quickly from the animals to the plain shaft below, the largest and grandest examples have a long intervening section with double volutes at the top and, inverted, at the bottom of a long fluted square zone, although the shaft of the column is round.
at the top of the round fluted shaft are two sections with a loosely plant-based design, the upper a form of "palm capital", spreading as it rises, and the lower suggesting leaves drooping downwards.
other capitals have the animals and the two lower plant-based elements, but not the section in between with the volutes; the example in chicago is of this type.
there are various small mouldings between the various elements, reflecting a greek style.
the horns and ears of the animals are often separate pieces, fitting into the head by square plugs.
the columns were polished and at least the capitals were painted, in the case of wooden ones on a plaster coating.
the style reflects influences from the many cultures that the persian empire conquered including egypt, babylon, and lydia, as well as greece, where the persians had only temporary success; the final result is distinctively persian.
it is thought the stone columns that survive were preceded by wooden versions, and these continued to be used.
the move to stone may have come when sufficiently large trees for the biggest buildings became difficult or impossible to source.
the column shafts can be as tall as 20 metres.
the base is in stone even for wooden columns, and sometimes carries an inscription saying which king erected the building.
most are round, but an early square type has two steps.
the full form of persian column seems only to have been used at a few sites outside persia around the empire in the achaemenid period, in armenia and even levantine colonies in iberia.
the columns influenced the pillars of ashoka erected in india some 80 years after alexander the great destroyed the persian empire, and other imperial buildings in the architecture of the maurya empire.
the much smaller mathura lion capital of around the year 0 shows clear influence.
they can be seen in relief decoration around buddhist stupas in gandhara in the 2nd or 3rd century ce.
the style did not develop in persia itself, but elements continued to appear under later dynasties before the arrival of islam.
from the 19th-century the full persepolitan form of the column was revived, initially by parsees in india and eclectic architects in europe, and only later used in public buildings in iran under the pahlavi dynasty (from 1925), though the former royal palace in the afif-abad garden, of 1863, tentatively uses some elements of the capitals.
reza shah, the first pahlavi shah of iran, promoted interest in the achaemenids in various ways to foster iranian nationalism and support the legitimacy of his regime.
significant buildings in tehran were supervised as to the authenticity of their style by european archaeologists, especially andré godard, maxime siroux (both also architects), and ernst herzfeld, who had been brought to iran to dig, curate, and train students.
these include the police headquarters and the bank melli iran headquarters.
though the islamic republic of iran prefers buildings that refer to islamic architecture, miniature persian columns support the scholars pavilion donated to the united nations office at vienna in 2009.

the tandang sora national shrine (filipino: dambana ni melchora (tandang sora) aquino) is a national monument and memorial park in quezon city, metro manila, philippines.
it is dedicated to filipino revolutionary and centenarian, melchora aquino who is also known as "tandang sora".
melchora aquino, popularly known as tandang sora is a key figure in the philippine revolution who offered shelter and medical aid to katipunan revolutionaries despite her old age.
she was known by the titles of "mother of the katipunan" and the "grand woman of the revolution" for her role in the revolution.
the place where the memorial is situated, along in present-day banlat road in a barangay in quezon city named in honor of her is her birthplace.
after her death, her remains were initially buried at the mausoleum of the veterans of the revolution at the manila north cemetery before being transferred to the himlayang pilipino.
in 2012, her remains were transferred to the tandang sora shrine.
the tandang sora shrine was "restored" by the quezon city government in 2005 as a tribute to melchora aquino and the shrine was built in 2008 during the tenure of then-quezon city mayor feliciano belmonte jr.. prior to the shrine's construction, a marker is already present near the site of the shrine although it is generally hidden from view from the public by houses.
the quezon city council declared 2012 as tandang sora year, a year-long celebration to mark the 200th birth anniversary of melchora auino.
in line of the commemoration, there were efforts by the city government to have aquino's remains which were then-located at the nearby himlayang pilipino exhumed and re-interred in the shrine.
such moves required approval from the congress and their bid was helped by the approval of the national historical commission of the philippines (nchp) of the plan in 2011. the himlayang pilipino also gave consent for the exhumation of aquino's remains.
melchora aquino's remains were then re-interred at the tandang sora shrine on january 6, 2012, on her birth day.
the re-interment ceremony was led by novaliches bishop antonio tobias who blessed aquino's casket.
the memorial was later declared a national shrine on march 2, 2012 by the nhcp through a resolution.
the shrine is situated along banlat road in barangay tandang sora, quezon city.
it covers an area of 1,000 m2 (11,000 sq ft) and features a 10.67 m (35.0 ft) bronze sculpture.
the remains of melchora aquino, which consists of three small bones and ash at the time of her re-interment in the shrine, is housed inside a small wooden casket, which in turn is placed inside a square space at the foot of the bronze sculpture designed by the toym imao.
an art gallery is also hosted within shrine grounds which features paintings and other sculptures dedicated to tandang sora made by local artists from quezon city.
it also has a pavilion and stage for events, and a mini-museum dedicated to melchora aquino.
the monument to sergei rachmaninov (russian: памятник сергею рахманинову) was installed in 1999 in moscow on strastnoy boulevard.

p. grigoriev.
the monument has the status of a declared object of cultural heritage.

to work on the monument began the sculptor oleg komov (1932–1994), but he died, almost finishing his sculpture.
for the installation of this monument, the sculptor's relatives asked for too high a fee, because of which they refused to install it in tambov.
soon it was decided to install this monument in moscow on strastnoy boulevard near house no.
5, where rakhmaninov lived from 1905 to 1917. completed the work of oleg komov, his pupil, sculptor andrei kovalchuk.
works on the installation of the monument were conducted under the guidance of yury rakhmaninov, the director of "transinzhstroy", a relative of the composer.

the monument to joseph brodsky (russian: памятник иосифу бродскому) is a was installed in 2011 in moscow on novinsky boulevard near the united states embassy building.
the authors of the monument are the sculptor georgy frangulyan and the architect sergey skuratov.
sculptor georgy frangulyan worked on the monument to the poet joseph brodsky for several years.
in 2008, the monument was cast in bronze, and in 2009 it was decided to install it in moscow on novinsky boulevard.
it took some time to make room for the monument, because there was a currency exchange office.
sculptor georgy frangulyan installed the monument on its own funds.
"the monument to brodsky is my personal gift to the city.
everything is complete: a pedestal, a granite, and a sculpture," - said the sculptor.
may 31, 2011 the solemn opening of the monument took place.
the ceremony was attended by state and public figures, famous artists and writers.
the monument to joseph brodsky was not accidentally installed near the american embassy.
joseph brodsky was persecuted in the ussr and was forced to emigrate to the united states.
the monument is a multi-figure composition, mounted on a granite pedestal.
13 faceless, schematically depicted bronze figures are united into two groups, symbolizing envious persons and friends.
before them is the relief figure of brodsky.
he will turn to the american embassy.
the head of the poet is thrown back up, his hands are thrust into the pockets of his pants.
he wears a foreign costume and sharp-pointed italian shoes.
the "we demand peace!"
(russian: требуем мира!)
is a multi-figure sculpture set in moscow in the park "museon".
it was made in 1950 in response to the war that was started by the korean war, the sculptor v. i. mukhina, together with n. g. zelenskaya, z. g. ivanova, s. v. kazakov, a. sergeyev.
vera mukhina decided to make a sculpture "we demand peace!"
in 1950, after learning about the war in korea.
together with her, the creative team worked on the monument: nina zelenskaya, zinaida ivanova, sergey kozakov and alexander sergeev.
vera mukhina called her work "agitational sculpture".
it was specially made by the method of galvano from light metal to facilitate transportation to various international conferences dedicated to the world .
in 1951, for the composition "demand peace!"
the collective of sculptors was awarded the stalin prize of the second degree.
two identical copies of this monument were made.
one of them remained in moscow and was installed at vdnh near mira avenue, and the second one was sent to pyongyang.
the moscow monument stood on vdnkh until 1994, after which the "museon" was moved.
there the sculpture stood in incomplete form: only three of the six figures were represented, the rest were stored in the museum's storerooms.
by the beginning of the 2010s the monument was in a bad condition, there were a number of fragments.
in 2012-2013, the restoration of the sculpture was carried out, the lost fragments were restored according to the gypsum original kept in the russian museum.
the sculptural composition "demand peace" includes six figures going in one direction.
three figures in the middle - a black man, a chinese and a russian - go with their hands clasped behind the defeated banners of the german army.
they symbolize nations that are striving for peace.
to the left is a blind invalid of war in a shabby european soldier's uniform, to the right - a korean mother raising a dead child.
these figures are reminiscent of the victims of the war.
in front of all there is a beautiful young woman with a child.
from her outstretched hands flies a pigeon - a symbol of peace.
this figure, apparently, represents a bright peaceful future, to which humanity aspires.
the main drawback of the sculptural composition of critics was called its disunity, it does not look like a single whole.
art critic s. s. valerius also noted the ambiguity of the interpretation of the work, in particular, the figure of a woman with a dove.
of the six figures, vera mukhina herself completely fulfilled only one - a korean woman with a dead child.
his plastic wealth and power, this sculpture clearly stands out from the whole composition.
for its foundation was taken a sketch "mother with a dead child", made by vera mukhina in 1941 under the impression from the first days of the great patriotic war.
the sculptor said this about her heroine: "she will go to the partisans - there can be no question of pleading".
the san francisco comfort women memorial is a monument that dedicates to the “comfort women” before and during world war ii.
it is built in remembrance of the girls and women that were sexually enslaved by the imperial japanese army through deceit, coercion, and brutal force.
the site is located near the saint mary's square, at the crossroads of san francisco chinatown and the financial district.
the statue “comfort women” column of strength, by sculptor steven whyte, is one of the nine and the first sculpture placed in a major u.s. city to commemorate the comfort women.
after the placement of the statue, hirofumi yoshimura—the mayor of osaka, japan—threatened to dissolve the sister-city relationship between osaka and san francisco that was established in 1957 in protest of the memorial.
the san francisco comfort women memorial and its bronze, 10-foot-tall “comfort women” column of strength statue were unveiled in the city on september 22nd, 2017. the memorial statue was designed by the carmel-based sculptor steven whyte.
it depicts three teen-age girls, with each being of a specific nationality—chinese, korean, and philippine—and altogether representing the estimated 200,000 “comfort women” from countries across east and southeast asia that were occupied by the imperial japanese army before and during world war ii.
these three girls are cast in bronze, standing in a circle atop a pedestal and holding hands in a back-to-back posture.
standing next to the pedestal and gazing up at them is another bronze figure of a halmoni (korean for grandmother).
it bears a resemblance to the korean human rights activist kim hak-sun, who was a victim of the forced enslavement to the imperial japanese army during wwii and the first woman in korea to come forward publicly about her experiences as a comfort woman.
steven whyte, the sculptor of the “comfort women” column of strength statue, is a british-american artist living in carmel, california.
his iconic works include a life-sized jumbo the elephant at tufts university, a multi-sculptures monument entitled national salute to bob hope and.
the military, and the column of strength statue for san francisco comfort women memorial.
whyte describes himself as “a figurative sculptor,” with a strong emphasis on the creation of characters in his works.
he has a preference in human form as the sculpture subject, and often works with live models when designing sculptures.
for the “comfort women” column of strength statue, he found local models from the central coast and designed the figures of the teen-age chinese, korean, and philippine girls partially based on the models.
whyte also describes himself as a “sculptor of people,”who prioritizes “the emotional quality and impact of the sculpture” and intends for his work to become catalysts for public responses, interactions, and conversations.
to make the “comfort women” column of strength statue resonate with its audience emotionally, whyte puts an emphasis on the girls’ strength and solidarity through their posture, and makes them look at viewers directly “in an almost accusatoryway” and with “post-traumatic” stress and shock.
whyte reflects on the column of strength statue that “this is a story that has been hidden for so long that if it serves a purpose — to make people look into history and learn from history a little more— then my work is done.”
in 2015, the san francisco board of supervisors unanimously passed the resolution to build a memorial dedicating to the “comfort women,” under the push led by retired judges lillian sing and julie tang.
according to district 1 supervisor eric mar, the memorial is expected to serve as the starting point for education and healing process, with an aim to “keep the issue alive when some in japan are trying to silence the issue.”
the memorial is privately funded by the comfort women justice coalition and was established in cooperation with other community organizations and city agencies.
the total amount raised by the organization was $205,000 to make and install the statue.
in a double-blind competition, british-american artist steven whyte’s design was chosen from more than 30 submissions from all over the world by an expert jury of arts professionals, community organizers and citizens.
whyte was then tasked with sculpting the memorial piece.
the sculpture was installed on september 22, 2017.
during the design process, the sensitivity of the controversial issue was taken into consideration and the statue was designed not to display any violence or brutality.
the memorial statue was given the name women's column of strength, and represents the young girls and women taken from china, korea, and the philippines, as well as to bring awareness to the sex trafficking of women during wartime.
despite the signing of the december 28, 2015 agreement between japan and korea, in which japan made an apology to the wartime sex trafficking of women and $8.3 million compensating payment, the dispute over “comfort women” seems to remain unsolved.
in 2017, after the unveiling ceremony of the “comfort women” column of strength statue, and in light of san francisco's recognition of the memorial and its statue, hirofumi yoshimura—the mayor of osaka, japan—protested and threatened to end the sisterhood between the two cities of osaka and san francisco, established in 1957.
according to the japanese national newspaper asahi shimbun, yoshimura contended that the relationship between osaka and san francisco of trust was “completely destroyed” by the placement of the statue.
he argued that the memorial was unnecessary because japan has already made amends regarding the issue of comfort women.
yoshimura also made the objection that the comfort women statue unfairly singles out japan for wartime atrocities.
he said that “i am in favor of activities to protect the dignity and human rights of women.
however, if the purpose is to protect the human rights of women, i would suggest that some of the special attention currently being given to japan’s ‘comfort women’ issue should be broadened to memorialize all the women who have been sexually assaulted and abused by soldiers of countries in the world.”
the installation of the san francisco statue worried some japanese-americans who felt it stigmatized the community and offered only a one-sided account to the comfort women story.
retired california judge and current chairman of the comfort women justice coalition, julie tang, refuted this claim by stating the memorial statue tackles the issue of women's freedom from sexual violence, such as through rape and assault during wartime.

a national monument is a monument constructed in order to commemorate something of importance to national heritage, such as a country's founding, independence, war, or the life and death of a historical figure.
the term may also refer to a specific monument status, such as a national heritage site, by reason of their cultural importance rather than age (see national monument (united states)).
national monument status is usually granted to colossal symbols of national identity.
structures or areas deemed to be of national importance and afforded protection by the state are part of a country's cultural heritage.
these national heritage sites are often called something different per country and are listed by national conservation societies.
romania has listed at least one plant as a national monument, nymphaea lotus f. thermalis.
a war memorial is a building, monument, statue or other edifice to celebrate a war or victory, or (predominating in modern times) to commemorate those who died or were injured in a war.
the oldest war memorial in the united kingdom is oxford university's all souls college.
it was founded in 1438 with the provision that its fellows should pray for those killed in the long wars with france.
war memorials for the franco-prussian war (1870–71) were the first in europe to have rank-and-file soldiers commemorated by name.
every soldier that was killed was granted a permanent resting-place as part of the terms of the treaty of frankfurt (1871).
to commemorate the millions who died in world war i, war memorials became commonplace in communities large and small around the world.
[citation needed]
in modern times the main intent of war memorials is not to glorify war, but to honor those who have died.
sometimes, as in the case of the warsaw genuflection of willy brandt, they may also serve as focal points of increasing understanding between previous enemies.
using modern technology an international project is currently archiving all post-1914 commonwealth war graves and commonwealth war graves commission memorials to create a virtual memorial (see the war graves photographic project for further details).
during wwi, many nations saw massive devastation and loss of life.
more people lost their lives in the east than in the west, but the outcome was different.
in the west, and in response to the victory there obtained, most of the cities in the countries involved in the conflict erected memorials, with the memorials in smaller villages and towns often listing the names of each local soldier who had been killed in addition (so far as the decision by the french and british in 1916 to construct governmentally designed cemeteries was concerned) to their names being recorded on military headstones, often against the will of those directly involved, and without any opportunity of choice in the british empire (imperial war graves commission).
massive british monuments commemorating thousands of dead with no identified war grave, such as the menin gate at ypres and the thiepval memorial on the somme, were also constructed.
the liberty memorial, located in kansas city, missouri, is a memorial dedicated to all americans who served in the great war.
for various reasons connected with their character, the same may be said to apply to certain governmental memorials in the united kingdom (the cenotaph in london, relating to the empire in general, and the scottish national war memorial in edinburgh, also with a reference to the empire, but with particular connections to the united kingdom, having been opened by the prince of wales in 1927 and with the king and the queen the first visitors and contributors of a casket of the scottish names for addition within the shrine).
in maryland, in the center of the city of baltimore facing the baltimore city hall to the west is a geometric paved tree-lined plaza with the war memorial building to the east with a large marble decorated civic auditorium and historical and veterans museum below, designed by laurence hall fowler, dedicated 1925.
after world war i, some towns in france set up pacifist war memorials.
instead of commemorating the glorious dead, these memorials denounce war with figures of grieving widows and children rather than soldiers.
such memorials provoked anger among veterans and the military in general.
the most famous is at gentioux-pigerolles in the department of creuse.
below the column which lists the name of the fallen stands an orphan in bronze pointing to an inscription 'maudite soit la guerre' (cursed be war).
feelings ran so high that the memorial was not officially inaugurated until 1990 and soldiers at the nearby army camp were under orders to turn their heads when they walked past.
another such memorial is in the small town of équeurdreville-hainneville (formerly équeurdreville) in the department of manche.
here the statue is of a grieving widow with two small children.
there seems to be no exact equivalent form of a pacifist memorial within the united kingdom but evidently sentiments were in many cases identical.
thus, and although it seems that this has never been generally recognized, it can be argued that there was throughout the united kingdom a construction of war memorials with reference to the concept of peace (e.g.
west hartlepool war memorial in what is now known as hartlepool (previously west hartlepool) with the inscription 'thine o lord is the victory' relating to amongst other architecture the 1871 royal albert hall of arts and sciences with a frieze including the same words and concluding 'glory be to god on high and on earth peace').
in many cases, world war i memorials were later extended to show the names of locals who died in the world war ii in addition.
since that time memorials to the dead in other conflicts such as the korean war and vietnam war have also noted individual contributions, at least in the west.
in relation to actions which may well in point of fact be historically connected with the world wars even if this happens, for whatever reason, not to be a matter of general discussion (e.g.
occupation by western forces in the 1920s of palestine and other areas being the homelands of arabs in the near east and followed eighty years later in 2001 by the '9/11' raid on new york and elsewhere in the united states) similar historically and architecturally significant memorials are also designed and constructed (vide national september 11 memorial).
a tank monument or armoured memorial is a tank withdrawn from military service and displayed to commemorate a battle or a military unit.
obsolete tanks may also be displayed as gate guards outside military bases.
immediately following the first world war, a number of obsolete tanks were presented to towns and cities throughout britain for display and for use as memorials: most were scrapped in the 1920s and 1930s, but one that survives is a mark iv female tank at ashford, kent.
several second world war tanks are preserved as memorials to major armoured offensives in the ardennes, such as the battle of sedan and the battle of the bulge.
these include:
a plinth-mounted t-35/85 tank commemorates the soldiers of the 5th guards tank army, at znamianka in ukraine.
many cemeteries tended by the commonwealth war graves commission have an identical war memorial called the cross of sacrifice designed by sir reginald blomfield that varies in height from 18 ft to 32 ft depending on the size of the cemetery.
if there are one thousand or more burials, a commonwealth cemetery will contain a stone of remembrance, designed by sir edwin lutyens with words from the wisdom of sirach: "their name liveth for evermore"; all the stones of remembrance are 11 ft 6 ins long and 5 ft high with three steps leading up to them.
arlington national cemetery has a canadian cross of sacrifice with the names of all the citizens of the usa who lost their lives fighting in the canadian forces during the korean war and two world wars.
war memorials can sometimes be politically controversial.
a notable case is that of the yasukuni shrine in japan, where a number of convicted world war ii war criminals are interred.
chinese and korean representatives have often protested against the visits of japanese politicians to the shrine.
the visits have in the past led to severe diplomatic conflicts between the nations, and japanese businesses were attacked in china after a visit by former japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi to the shrine was widely reported and criticized in chinese and korean media.
in a similar case, former german chancellor helmut kohl was criticised by writers günter grass and elie wiesel for visiting the war cemetery at bitburg (in the company of ronald reagan) which also contained the bodies of ss troops.
unlike the case of the yasukuni shrine, there was no element of intentional disregard of international opinion involved, as is often claimed for the politician visits to the japanese shrine.
soviet world war ii memorials included quotes of joseph stalin's texts, frequently replaced after his death.
such memorials were often constructed in city centres and now are sometimes regarded as symbols of soviet occupation and removed, which in turn may spark protests (see bronze soldier of tallinn).
the fusiliers' memorial arch to the royal dublin fusiliers who fought in the boer war, erected at 1907 in st. stephen's green, dublin, was called "traitors' gate" by the redmondites and later irish republicans, from whose point of view irish soldiers going off to fight the british empire's wars were traitors to ireland.
the sharpness of the controversy gradually faded, and while the term "traitors' gate" is still in occasional colloquial use in dublin daily life, it has mostly lost its pejorative meaning.
in australia, in 1981, historian henry reynolds raised the issue of whether war memorials should be erected to indigenous australians who had died fighting against british invaders on their lands.
how, then, do we deal with the aboriginal dead?
white australians frequently say that 'all that' should be forgotten.
but it will not be.
it cannot be.
black memories are too deeply, too recently scarred.
and forgetfulness is a strange prescription coming from a community which has revered the fallen warrior and emblazoned the phrase 'lest we forget' on monuments throughout the land.
[...] [d]o we make room for the aboriginal dead on our memorials, cenotaphs, boards of honour and even in the pantheon of national heroes?
if we are to continue to celebrate the sacrifice of men and women who died for their country can we deny admission to fallen tribesmen?
there is much in their story that australians have traditionally admired.
they were ever the underdogs, were always outgunned, yet frequently faced death without flinching.
if they did not die for australia as such they fell defending their homelands, their sacred sites, their way of life.
what is more the blacks bled on their own soil and not half a world away furthering the strategic objectives of a distant motherland whose influence must increasingly be seen as of transient importance in the history of the continent.
reynolds' suggestion proved controversial.
occasional memorials have been erected to commemorate aboriginal people's resistance to colonisation, or to commemorate white massacres of indigenous australians.
these memorials have often generated controversy.
for example, a 1984 memorial to the kalkadoon people's "resistance against the paramilitary force of european settlers and the queensland native mounted police" was "frequently shot at" and "eventually blown up".
with the advent of long war, some memorials are constructed before the conflict is over, leaving space for extra names of the dead.
for instance, the northwood gratitude and honor memorial in irvine, ca, memorializes an ongoing pair of us wars, and has space to inscribe the names of approximately 8,000 fallen servicemembers, while the uk national memorial arboretum near lichfield in england hosts the uk's national armed forces memorial which displays the names of the more than 16,000 people who have already died on active service in the uk armed forces since world war ii, with more space available for future fatalities.

lázaro cárdenas del río (local spanish pronunciation: [ˈlasaɾo ˈkaɾðenas] (listen); may 21, 1895  – october 19, 1970) was a general in the constitutionalist army during the mexican revolution and a statesman who served as president of mexico between 1934 and 1940. he is best known for nationalization of the oil industry in 1938 and the creation of pemex, the government oil company.
he also revived agrarian reform in mexico, expropriating large landed estates and distributing land to small holders in collective holdings (ejidos).
although he was not from the state of sonora, whose generals had dominated mexican politics in the 1920s, cárdenas was loyal to sonoran general and former president plutarco elías calles (1924–28).
calles had founded the national revolutionary party (pnr) in the wake of the assassination of sonoran general alvaro obregón, who served as president (1920–24) and was president-elect in 1928. cárdenas was calles's hand-picked candidate in 1934 to run for the presidency.
while calles did not hold the title of president, he had remained the power behind the presidency, and expected to maintain that role when cárdenas took office.
however, cárdenas out-maneuvered him politically and eventually forced the former president into exile, establishing cárdenas's legitimacy and power in his own right during his remaining time in office.
in 1938, cárdenas transformed the structure of the party calles founded, creating the partido de la revolución mexicana (prm), based on sectoral representation of peasants via peasant leagues, unionized workers, professionals, and the mexican army.
cárdenas's incorporation of the army into the party structure was a deliberate move to diminish the power of the military and prevent their traditional intervention in politics through coups d'état.
an important political achievement of cárdenas was his complete surrender of power in december 1940 to his elected successor, manuel ávila camacho, who was a political moderate without a distinguished military record.
cárdenas has been revered as "the greatest constructive radical of the mexican revolution," for reviving its ideals, but he has also been criticized as an "authoritarian populist."
according to numerous opinion polls and analysts, cárdenas is the most popular mexican president of the 20th century.
lázaro cárdenas del río was born on may 21, 1895, one of eight children in a lower-middle-class  family in the village of jiquilpan, michoacán, where his father owned a billiard hall.
after the death of his father, from age 16 cárdenas supported his family (including his mother and seven younger siblings).
by the age of 18, he had worked as a tax collector, a printer's devil, and a jail keeper.
although he left school at the age of eleven, he used every opportunity to educate himself and read widely throughout his life, especially works of history.
cárdenas set his sights on becoming a teacher, but was drawn into the military during the mexican revolution after victoriano huerta overthrew president francisco madero in february 1913. michoacán was far from the revolutionary action that had brought madero to the mexican presidency, but after huerta's coup and madero's assassination, cárdenas joined a group of zapatistas, but huerta's forces scattered the group, where cárdenas had served as captain and paymaster.
since revolutionary forces were voluntary organizations, his position of leadership points to his skills and his being paymaster to the perception that he would be honest in financial matters.
both characteristics followed him through his subsequent career.
he escaped the federal forces in michoacán and moved north where he served initially with álvaro obregón, then pancho villa, and after 1915 when villa was defeated by obregón to plutarco elías calles, who served constitutionalist leader, venustiano carranza.
although cárdenas was from the southern state of michoacán, his key experiences in the revolution were with constitutionalist northerners, whose faction won.
in particular, he served under calles, who tasked him with military operations against yaqui indians and against zapatistas in michoacán and jalisco, during which time he rose to a field command as general, and then in 1920 after carranza was overthrown by northern generals, cárdenas was given the rank of brigadier general at the age of 25. cárdenas was appointed provisional governor of his home state of michoacán under the brief presidency of adolfo de la huerta.
cárdenas was a political protégé of calles, but his ideological mentor was revolutionary general francisco j. múgica, a strongly anticlerical, secular socialist.
president calles appointed cárdenas chief of military operations in the huasteca, an oil producing region on the gulf coast.
cárdenas saw first-hand the operations of the foreign oil companies.
in the huasteca, u.s. oil companies extracted oil, avoided taxes owed to the mexican government, and treated the region as “conquered territory.” múgica also was posted to the huasteca and he and cárdenas became close.
during their time in the huasteca, múgica told cárdenas that “socialism [is] the appropriate doctrine for resolving conflicts in mexico.”
cárdenas was appointed governor of his home state of michoacan in 1928, which was then wracked by the political conflict between state and church, the known as the cristiada.
his ideological mentor múgica had previously served as the state's governor, and had attempted to counter the power of the roman catholic church through laws.
he mobilized groups to support his positions, creating “political shock troops,” consisting of public school teachers and members of a disbanded agrarian league, forming the confederación revolucionaria michoacana del trabajo, under the slogan of “union, land, work.”  the organization was funded by the state government, although not listed as an official expenditure.
it became the single-most powerful organization representing both workers and peasants.
mobilizing worker and peasant support and controlling the organization to which they belonged became the model for cárdenas when he became president.
as governor, cárdenas also prioritized distribution of land at a time when president calles was disillusioned by the program.
he expropriated haciendas and created ejidos, collectively held, state-controlled landholdings.
ejiditarios, members of the ejido, worked individual plots of land but did not hold title to it as private property.
opposition to the program came from estate owners (hacendados), the clergy, and in some cases tenant farmers, but cárdenas continued with the program of land reform in his state.
during his four years as governor, cárdenas initiated a modest re-distribution of land at the state level, encouraged the growth of peasant and labor organizations, and improved education at a time when it was neglected by the federal government.
cárdenas ensured that teachers were paid on time, personally inspected schools, and opened a hundred new rural schools.
due to his grassroots style of governing, cárdenas made important policy decisions based on direct information received from the public rather than on the advice of his confidants.
during his term as governor, cárdenas sought to bring peace to the state, unite its population divided by the on-going cristero war, and make michoacan, especially the historic town of pátzcuaro into a tourist destination.
once he was president of mexico, he continued to devote government funding to the project.
cárdenas built a house in pátzcuaro when he became governor of the state, naming it "la quinta eréndira," after the purépecha princess, who has been identified as mexico's first anticolonial heroine for her resistance to the spanish conquest, and a contrasting figure to malinche, cortés's cultural translator.
eréndira became a popular historical figure under cárdenas.
at his estate, he commissioned murals for the house, which are now lost, but it is known from historical sources that they had indigenous themes, particularly the rise and fall of the purépecha empire at the time of the spanish conquest.
the murals and the texts "appropriate national historical narratives in order to supplant the national myths and locate mexico's ideal foundations in michoacan."
calles tapped cárdenas to be the party's president.
of the revolutionary generals, cárdenas was considered "honest, able, anticlerical, and politically astute," he had come from a poor and marginal state of mexico, but had risen to political prominence by his military skills on the battlefield but importantly he had chosen the correct side of decisive splits since 1913. when he was chosen as the presidential candidate in 1934, no one expected him to be anything other than being loyal to calles, the "jefe máximo", and power behind the presidency since 1929.
as the pnr's candidate, cárdenas's election was a foregone conclusion.
it was politically impossible for his patron, calles, to serve as president again, but he continued to dominate mexico after his presidency (1924–28) through what were considered "puppet" administrations in a period known as the maximato.
after two of his hand-picked men held office, the pnr balked in 1932 at supporting his first choice, manuel pérez treviño.
instead, they selected cárdenas as the presidential candidate.
calles agreed, believing he could control cárdenas as he had controlled his predecessors.
not only had cárdenas been associated with calles for two decades, but he had prospered politically with calles' patronage.
as expected, cárdenas won handily, officially winning over 98 percent of the vote.
cárdenas ran on the six year plan for social and political reform that the party drafted under calles's direction.
such a multiyear program was patterned after the just-completed five year plan of the soviet union.
the six-year plan (to span the presidential term 1934–40) was a patchwork of proposals from a variety of participants, but the driving force behind it was calles, who had given a speech in may 1933, saying that the "mexican revolution had failed in most of its important objectives," and that a plan needed to implement its objectives.
interim president abelardo l. rodríguez did not get his cabinet's approval for the plan in 1933, so that calles's next move was to present it in draft form to the party convention.
"rather than a blueprint, the six-year plan was a sales prospectus," and a "hopeless jumble" filled with compromises and contradictions, as well as utopian aspirations.
but the direction of the plan was toward renewed reform.
the plan called for
assured of the backing of the powerful calles and a presidential victory, cárdenas took the opportunity to actively campaign in many parts of mexico rather than remaining in mexico city.
his 25,000 kilometer campaign accomplished several things, including making direct contact with regions and constituents who had never seen a presidential candidate before and thus building cárdenas a personal power base.
the campaign also allowed him to refine and articulate for popular consumption what he considered the important elements of the six year plan.
on the campaign trail, he acted more like someone already in office than a candidate, settling disputes between groups.
he reached out to mexican workers, as well as peasants, to whom he promised land reform.
cárdenas promised amerindians schools and educational opportunities, and urged them to join with workers against exploitative practices.
cárdenas's cabinet when he was first in office included calles family members, his oldest son rodolfo at the secretariat of communications and public works (1934–35); aarón sáenz garza, the brother-in-law of calles's second son, plutarco jr. ("aco"), was appointed the administrator for mexico city (1934–35), a cabinet-level position.
others with loyalty to calles were radical tomás garrido canabal at the secretariat of agriculture and development (1934–35); marxist narciso bassols held the post of secretary of finance and public credit (1934–35); emilio portes gil, who had been interim president of mexico following the assassination of obregón but not chosen as the pnr presidential candidate in 1929, held the position of foreign secretary (1934–35).
cárdenas chose his comrade-in-arms and mentor francisco josé múgica as secretary of the national economy (1934–35).
as cárdenas began to chart his own course and outflank calles politically, he replaced calles loyalists in 1935 with his own men.
cárdenas's first action after taking office late in 1934 was to have his presidential salary cut in half.
he became the first occupant of the official presidential residence of los pinos.
he had the previous residence, the ostentatious chapultepec castle, turned into the national museum of history.
in a move that struck at the financial interests of his patron calles's cronies, cárdenas closed down their gambling casinos and brothels, where "prominent callistas had invested their profits from bribery and industrial activities."
cárdenas did not use armored cars or bodyguards to protect himself.
in the presidential campaign of 1934, he travelled through much of the rural areas by auto and horseback, accompanied only by rafael m. pedrajo, a chauffeur and an aide-de-camp.
his fearlessness generated widespread respect for cárdenas, who had demonstrated his bravery and leadership as a revolutionary general.
after being elected and assuming office, cárdenas led the congress in condemning calles's persecution of the catholic church in mexico.
he ousted calles and exiled him in 1936 as he consolidated power in his own right, ending the so-called maximato with calles being the power behind the presidency.
cárdenas had calles and twenty of his corrupt associates arrested and deported to the united states.
the majority of the mexican public strongly supported these actions.
cárdenas's most sweeping reforms were in the agrarian and industrial worker sectors, with the early years of his presidency, (1934–38) being the most radical and their policies most lasting.
these two sectors were where mobilization was strongest prior to cárdenas's presidency, so there was a confluence of peasant and worker interests seeking reform and empowerment with a president who was sympathetic to their aspirations and understood the importance of their support to the mexican state and to cárdenas's dominant party.
he also implemented educational reforms, particularly socialist education and the elimination of religious schooling.
during cárdenas' presidency, the government enacted land reform that was "sweeping, rapid, and, in some respects, innovative".
he redistributed large commercial haciendas, some 180,000 km2 of land to peasants.
with the powers of article 27 of the mexican constitution, he created agrarian collectives, or ejidos, which in early twentieth-century mexico were an not a typical form of landholding.
two high-profile regions of expropriation for cárdenas's agrarian reform were in the productive cotton-growing region in northern mexico, known as la laguna, the other was in yucatán, where the economy was dominated by henequen production.
other areas that saw significant land reform were baja california and sonora in northern mexico and his home state of michoacan and chiapas in southern mexico.
in 1937, cárdenas invited andrés molina enríquez, intellectual father of article 27 of the 1917 constitution, to accompany him to yucatán to implement the land reform, even though molina enríquez was not a big supporter of the collective ejido system.
although he could not go due to ill health, he defended cárdenas's action against luis cabrera, who argued that the ejidal bank that cárdenas established when he embarked on his sweeping redistribution of land was, in fact, making the mexican state the new hacienda owner.
for molina enríquez, the yucatecan henequen plantations were an "evil legacy" and "hellholes" for the maya.
as a lifelong supporter of land reform, molina enríquez's support of cárdenas's "glorious crusade" was important.
cárdenas knew that peasant support was important and as a presidential candidate in 1933, he reached out to an autonomous peasant organization, the liga nacional campesina (national peasant league) and promised to integrate it into the party structure.
the liga split over this question, but one element was integrated into the partido nacional revolucionario.
cárdenas expanded the peasant league's base in 1938 into the confederación nacional campesina (cnc).
cárdenas "believed that an organized peasantry would represent a political force capable of confronting the established landholding elite, as well as providing a critical voting block for the new mexican state."
scholars differ as to cárdenas's intent for the cnc, with some viewing it as an autonomous organization that would advocate for peasants regarding land tenure, rural projects, and peasant political interests, while others see the cnc as in patron-client relationship with the state, restricting its autonomy.
the cnc was created with the idea of "peasant unification" and was controlled by the government.
peasants' rights were acknowledged, but peasants were to be responsible allies of the political regime.
the radical confederation of mexican workers (ctm) and the mexican communist party (pcm) sought to organize peasants, but cárdenas asserted the government's right to do that since it was in charge of land reform and warned that their attempting to organize the peasantry would sow dissension.
cárdenas further strengthened the government's role by creating rural militias or reserves, which armed some 60,000 peasants by 1940, which were under the control of the army.
the armed peasantry helped promote political stability against regional strongmen (caudillos).
they could ensure that government land reform was accomplished.
peasant reserves could protect recipients of reform against estate owners and break rural strikes that threatened government control.
agrarian reform took place in a patchwork fashion with uneven results.
over years, many regions had experienced peasant mobilization in the face of repression and "low intensity agrarian warfare."
the peasant movement in morelos had mobilized before the mexican revolution and had success under emiliano zapata's leadership extinguished the hacienda system in that state.
in cárdenas's agrarian reform, with the revolutionary regime consolidated and agrarian problems still unresolved, the president courted mobilized agraristas, who now found the state attentive to their issue.
land reform, with some exceptions such as in yucatán, took place in areas of previous mobilization.
peasants themselves pushed for agrarian reform and to the extent it was accomplished, they were integral agents not merely the recipients of top-down state largesse.
however, the peasantry was under the control of the national government with no outlet for independent organization or the formation of alliances with mexican urban workers.
the other key sector of reform was industrial labor.
article 123 of the 1917 constitution had empowered labor in an unprecedented way, guaranteeing worker rights such as the eight-hour day and the right to strike, but in a more comprehensive fashion, article 123 signaled that the mexican state was on the side of labor.
a labor organization already existed when cárdenas took office, the crom union of luis morones.
morones was forced out of his cabinet post in calles's government and the crom declined in power and influence, with major defections of mexico city unions, one of which was led by socialist vicente lombardo toledano.
cárdenas promoted toledano's "purified" confederation of mexican workers, which evolved into the mexican confederation of workers or ctm.
the ctm's alliance with cárdenas was tactical and conditional, seeing their interests being forwarded by cárdenas, but not controlled by him.
as with the agrarian sector with mobilized peasants, mobilized and organized workers had long agitated and fought for their interests.
article 123 of the constitution was a tangible result of their participation in the mexican revolution on the constitutionalist side.
in fact, workers organized by the casa del obrero mundial, a radical labor organization, fought in the red battalions against the peasant revolutionaries led by emiliano zapata.
lombardo toledano and the ctm supported cárdenas's exile of calles and in the same stroke cárdenas also exiled crom's discredited leader, luis napoleón morones.
cárdenas nationalized the railway system creating the ferrocarriles nacionales de méxico in 1938 and put under a "workers' administration."
but his most sweeping nationalization was that of the petroleum industry in 1938.
during the calles maximato, mexican education policies were directed at curtailing the cultural influence of the catholic church by introducing sex education and leftist ideology via socialist education, and generally aiming to create a national civic culture.
cárdenas as a presidential candidate, under the patronage of fierce anticlerical calles, was in favor of such policies.
the opposition to socialist education by the catholic church as an institution and rural catholics in such strongholds as michoacan, jalisco, and durango saw the revival of armed peasant opposition, sometimes known as the second cristiada.
the extent of the opposition was significant and cárdenas chose to step back from implementing the radical educational policies, particularly as he became engaged with undermining calles's power.
cárdenas gained support from the catholic church when he distanced himself from anticlerical policies.
an important addition to higher education in mexico was when cárdenas established a technical university in mexico city, in the wake of the 1938 oil expropriation.
the instituto politécnico nacional was created train engineers and scientists.
cárdenas created the new cabinet-level department of indigenous affairs (departamento de asuntos indígenas) in 1936, with graciano sánchez, an agrarista leader in charge.
after a controversy at the dai, sánchez was replaced by a scholar, prof. luis chávez orozco.
cárdenas was influenced by an advocate of indigenismo, moisés sáenz, who earned a doctorate in education from columbia university and had held a position in the calles administration in the secretariat of public education (sep).
although initially an assimilationist for mexico's indigenous, he shifted his perspective after a period of residence in a purépecha village, which he published as carapan: bosquejo de una experiencia.
he came to see indigenous culture as having value.
sáenz advocated for educational and economic reforms that would better the indigenous, and this became the aim of the department cárdenas created.
the official 1940 government report on the cárdenas administration states that “the indigenous problem is one of the most serious that the revolutionary government has had to confront.” the aim of the department was to study fundamental problems concerning mexico's indigenous, particularly economic and social conditions, and then propose measures to the executive power for coordinated action to promote and manage measures considered to be in the interests of centers of indigenous populations.
most indigenous people were found in veracruz, oaxaca, chiapas, and yucatán, according to the 1930 national census.
in 1936 and 1937, the department had approximately 100 employees and a budget of $750,000 pesos, but as with other aspects of the cárdenas regime, 1938 marked a significant increase personnel and budget; 350 employees in 1938 and a budget of $2.77 million pesos and in 1939, the high point in the department's budget, there were 850 employees with a budget of $3.75 million pesos.
in 1940, the budget remained robust at $3 million pesos, with 650 employees.
the function of the department was primarily economic and educational.
specifically it was tasked with defending indigenous villages and communities, holders of ejidos (ejidatarios) and indigenous citizens from persecution and abuse that could be committed by any type of authority.
it defended ejido officials (comisariados ejidales) and agricultural cooperatives.
the goals that the department worked toward were primarily economic and education, with cultural actions second.
social measures and public health/sanitation were less important in terms of action for this department.
the department promoted a series of national indigenous congresses, bringing together different indigenous groups to meet as indigenous and discuss common issues.
the government's aim in doing this was to have them move in concert toward the “integral liberation” (liberación integral), with their rights respected by the primary goal was to incorporate indigenous into the larger, national population on an equal basis.
initially in 1936 and 1937, there was one annual conference.
the first one drew approximately 300 pueblos, while the second only 75. in 1938, there were two conferences with 950 pueblos represented.
the last two years of the cárdenas sexenio there were two congresses each year, but sparser attendance at around 200 pueblos each.
the government attempted to engage the active participation of the indigenous pueblos, seeing that such engagement was the key to success, but the fall-off in the last two years indicates decreased mobilization.
the department published 12 edited books with a total publication run of 350 as well as 170 tape recorded materials in indigenous languages.
in february 1940, the department established a separate medical/sanitary section with 4 clinics in chihuahua and one in sonora, but the largest number were in central in southern mexico.
in 1940, the first interamerican indigenista congress met in pátzcuaro, michoacán, with cárdenas giving a plenary address to the participants.
cárdenas had pushed for women's suffrage in mexico, responding to the pressure from women activists and from the political climate that emphasized equality of citizens.
mexico was not alone in latin america in not enfranchising women, but in 1932, both brazil and uruguay had extended suffrage to women, and ecuador had also done so.
women had made a significant contribution to the mexican revolution, but had not made gains in the postrevolutionary phase as women.
women who were members of the national peasants confederation (confederación nacional campesina) or the confederation of mexican workers (confederación de trabajadores mexicanos) were by virtue of their membership umbrella organizations were members of cárdenas's reorganized party, the party of the mexican revolution or prm, done in 1938. in practice, however, women were marginalized from power.
women could not stand for national or local governmental elections or vote.
the constitution of 1917 did not explicitly address women's rights and so to enfranchise women required a constitutional amendment.
the amendment itself was simple and brief, specifying that "mexicanos" referred to both women and men.
many pnr congressmen and senators gave supportive speeches for the amendment, but there was opposition.
cárdenas's impending reorganization of the party, which took place in 1938, was a factor in changing some opponents into supporters.
in the end, it passed unanimously and was sent to the states to ratify it.
despite the speeches and the ratifications, opponents used a loophole to block the amendment's implementation by refusing to publish notice of the change in the diario official.
skeptics of women's suffrage were suspicious that conservative catholic women would take instructions on voting from priests and so undermine the progressive gains of the revolution.
conservative catholic women had mobilized during the church-state conflict of the late 1920s, the cristero rebellion, giving material aid to cristero armies, and even forming a secret society, feminine brigades of st. joan of arc.
the concern about mexican women taking advise from priests on voting had some foundation in the example of the leftist spanish republic of the 1930s.
many spanish women indeed supported the position of the catholic, church which was opposed to the republic's anticlerical policies.
the spanish civil war (1936–1939) was for mexico a cautionary tale, the failure of a leftist regime after a military coup.
cárdenas was unable to overcome opposition to women's suffrage although he personally was committed to the cause.
women did not get the vote in mexico until 1953, when the mexican government was pursuing economic policies friendlier to business and there was a modus vivendi with the catholic church in mexico.
the partido de la revolución  mexicana (prm) came into being on march 30, 1938 after the party founded in 1929 by calles, the partido nacional revolucionario (pnr), was dissolved.
cárdenas's prm was reorganized again in 1946 as the institutional revolutionary party.
calles founded the  pnr in the wake of president-elect obregón's assassination in order to create some way for revolutionary leaders to maintain order and power.
calles could not be re-elected as president, but did hold power through the newly created party.
often called the "official party", it "was created as a cartel to control localized political machines and interests."
when cárdenas ran as the candidate of the pnr in 1934, calles had expected to continue to be the real power in mexico.
cárdenas might have been one of the short-term, powerless presidents of the years 1929–1934, but instead he built a large and mobilized base of support of industrial workers and peasants and forced calles into exile in 1935. cárdenas further consolidated power by dissolving the pnr and creating a new party with a completely different kind of organization.
the prm was organized in four sectors, industrial labor, peasants, a middle class sector (composed largely of government workers), and the military.
this organization was a resurrection of corporatism, essentially organization by estates or interest groups.
each sector of the party had a parallel organization, so that the labor sector was composed of the confederation of mexican workers (ctm), the peasant sector by the national confederation of campesinos, (cnc); and the middle class sector by the federation of unions of workers in service to the state (fstse), created in 1938. the old federal army had been destroyed in the revolution and the post-revolutionary military had increasingly been transformed from a collection of veteran revolutionary fighters into a military organized along more traditional lines of hierarchy and control.the military had in most of latin america in the post-independence period viewed itself as the arbiter of power and intervened in politics by force or the threat of force.
in the post-revolutionary period, presidents of mexico, including cárdenas, were former generals in the revolutionary army.
curbing the power of the military was instigated by álvaro obregón and calles, but the threat of revolt and undermining of the state remained, as the cristero rebellion showed in the late 1920s, led by a former revolutionary general, enrique gorostieta.
cárdenas aimed to undermine the military's potential to dominate politics by making it a sector of the official party.
although some critics questioned the military's incorporation into the party, cárdenas saw it as a way to assert civilian control.
he is quoted as saying, "we did not put the army in politics.
it was already there.
in fact it had been dominating the situation, and we did well to reduce its voice to one in four."
cárdenas had already mobilized workers and peasants into a counterweight to the "military's domination of politics."
these groups often had different interests, but rather than creating a pluralist system in which the groups competed, the corporatist model placed the president as the arbiter of interests.
thus, the organization of different interest groups with formal representation in the party gave them access to largesse from the state, but also limited their ability to act autonomously since they were dependents of the new system.
the corporatist model is most often associated with fascism, whose rise in germany and italy in the 1930s coincided with cárdenas's presidency.
cárdenas was emphatically opposed to fascism, but created the prm and organized the mexican state on authoritarian lines.
that reorganization can be seen as the enduring legacy of the cárdenas presidency.
although the prm was reorganized into the institutional revolutionary party in 1946, the basic structure was retained.
cárdenas's calculation that the military's incorporation into the prm would undermine its power was essentially correct, since it disappeared as a separate sector of the party, but was absorbed into the "popular" sector.
cárdenas had had dealings with the oil industry in the huasteca in his capacity as military commander there.
ongoing issues with the foreign-owned companies and the mexican petroleum workers' organization became increasingly tense.
early in his presidency, he declared that a previous agreement between companies and the government "was not in harmony with the  basic principle of article 27 of the constitution."
in 1936, the 18,000 member oil workers' union forced oil companies to sign the first-ever collective bargaining agreement.
the union demanded 26 million pesos, the companies offered 12 million.
giving more force to mexican workers' demands, cárdenas set up the national oil administration and the government's council of conciliation and arbitration took jurisdiction over the wage dispute.
the council supported the workers' demands and the companies refused to pay.
to put even more force into the government's position, it cancelled oil concessions dating to the porfirato.
this move was unprecedented in the history of foreign oil in mexico.
management and high level skilled workers were all foreigners, so the companies thought that nationalization would be a rash move for mexico.
the companies appealed the government's decision to force companies to pay the wages to the mexican supreme court, which ruled against them on march 1, 1938.  cárdenas was ready to act.
cárdenas tasked his old comrade francisco j. múgica with writing the declaration to the nation about expropriation.
on march 18, 1938, cárdenas nationalized mexico's petroleum reserves and expropriated the equipment of the foreign oil companies in mexico.
the announcement inspired a spontaneous six-hour parade in mexico city; it was followed by a national fund-raising campaign to compensate the private companies.
the legislation for nationalization provided for compensation for the expropriated assets, but cárdenas' action angered the international business community and western governments, especially the united kingdom.
the mexican government was more worried about the lack of technical expertise within the nation to run the refineries.
before leaving, the oil companies had ensured they left nothing of value behind, hoping to force cárdenas to accept their conditions.
mexico was eventually able to restart the oil fields and refineries, but production did not rise to pre-nationalization levels until 1942, after the entry of the united states into world war ii.
the us sent technical advisers to mexico to ensure production could support the overall allied war effort.
in 1938, the british severed diplomatic relations with cárdenas' government, and boycotted mexican oil and other goods.
an international court  ruled that mexico had the authority for nationalization.
with the outbreak of world war ii, oil became a highly sought-after commodity.
the company that cárdenas founded, petróleos mexicanos (or pemex), later served as a model for other nations seeking greater control over their own oil and natural gas resources.
in the early 21st century, its revenues continued to be the most important source of income for the country, despite weakening finances.
cárdenas founded the national polytechnic institute in order to ensure the education and training of people to run the oil industry.
cárdenas supported the republican government of spain against right-wing general francisco franco's forces during the spanish civil war.
franco was given support by germany and italy.
mexico's support of the republican government was "by selling arms to the republican army, underwriting arms purchases from third parties, supporting the republic in the league of nations, providing food, shelter and education for children orphaned during the spanish civil war."
although mexico's efforts in the spanish civil war were not enough to save the spanish republic, it did provide a place of exile for as many as 20,000-40,000 spanish refugees.
among those who reached mexico were distinguished intellectuals who left a lasting imprint in mexican cultural life.
the range of refugees may be seen from an analysis of the 4,559 passengers arriving in mexico in 1939 on board the ships sinaia, ipanema and mexique; the largest groups were technicians and qualified workers (32%), farmers and ranchers (20%), along with professionals, technicians, workers, business people students and merchants, who represented 43% of the total.
the casa de españa, founded with mexican government support in the early 1930s, was an organization to provide a safe haven for spanish loyalist intellectuals and artists.
it became the colegio de méxico in october 1940, an elite institution of higher education in mexico, in 1940 with the support of cárdenas's government.
in 1936, cárdenas allowed russian exile leon trotsky to settle in mexico, reportedly to counter accusations that cárdenas was a stalinist.
cárdenas was not as left-wing as leon trotsky and other socialists would wish, but trotsky described his government as the only honest one in the world.

mexico's most important relations with foreign countries during the cárdenas presidency was the united states, but cárdenas attempted to influence fellow latin american nations viable formal diplomatic efforts in cuba, chile, colombia, and peru, especially in the cultural sphere.
mexico sent artists, engineers, and athletes as good will efforts.
no latin american country emulated cárdenas's radical policies in the agrarian sector, education, or economic nationalism.
the development bank, nacional financiera was founded during his term as president.
although not extensively active during that period, in the post-world war ii era of the mexican miracle, the bank was an important tool in government industrialization projects.
cárdenas became known for his progressive program of building roads and schools and promoting education, gaining congressional approval to allocate twice as much federal money to rural education as all his predecessors combined.
cárdenas ended capital punishment (in mexico, usually in the form of a firing squad).
capital punishment has been banned in mexico since that time.
the control of the republic by cárdenas and the pri (partido revolucionario institucional) predecessor partido de la revolución mexicana without widespread bloodshed effectively signaled the end of rebellions that began with the 1910 mexican revolution.
despite cárdenas' policy of socialist education, he also improved relations with the roman catholic church during his administration.
the last military revolt in mexico was that of saturnino cedillo, a regional caudillo and former revolutionary general whose power base was in the state of san luis potosí.
cedillo was a supporter of calles and had participated in the formation of the partido nacional revolucionario.
he was a "paradigmatic figure," acting as a strong leader in his region and mediating between the federal government and his local power base.
as a powerbroker with demonstrated military and political skills, he had a great deal of autonomy in san luis potosí, serving a term as governor (1927–32), but then modeling calles's maximato was the power behind the governorship.
cedillo supported cárdenas in his power struggle with calles.
however, relations between cedillo and cárdenas soured, particularly as cárdenas's new political system was consolidated and undermined the autonomous power of local caciques.
cárdenas was ideologically more radical than cedillo, and cedillo became a major figure in right-wing opposition to cárdenas.
groups around him included the fascist “gold shirts”, seen as a force capable of ousting cárdenas.
cedillo rose in revolt in 1938 against cárdenas, but the federal government had clear military superiority and crushed the uprising.
in 1939, cedillo, members of his family, and a number of supporters were killed, cedillo himself betrayed by a follower while he was in hiding.
he was “the last of the great military caciques of the mexican revolution who maintained his own quasi-private army,” and who constructed “his campesino fiefdom.” cárdenas's victory over cedillo showed the power and consolidation of the newly reorganized mexican state, but also a showdown between two former revolutionary generals in the political sphere.
there was more organized and ideological opposition to cárdenas.
right-wing political groups opposed cárdenas's policies, including the national synarchist union (uns), a popular, pro-catholic, quasi-fascist movement founded in 1937 opposed his "atheism" and collectivism.
catholic, pro-business conservatives founded the national action party (pan) in 1939, which became the principal opposition party in later years and won the presidency in 2000.
in the elections of 1940, cárdenas, hoping to prevent another uprising or even "an outright counter-revolution throughout the republic" by those opposed to his leftist policies, endorsed the prm nominee manuel ávila camacho, a moderate conservative.
obregonista francisco múgica would have been cárdenas's ideological heir, and he had played an important role in the revolution, the leader of the left-wing faction that successfully placed key language in the constitution of 1917, guaranteeing the rights of labor.
múgica had known cárdenas personally since 1926 when the two were working in veracruz.
múgica had served in cárdenas's cabinet as secretary of the national economy and as secretary of the ministry of communications and public works.
in those positions, múgica made sure the federal government pursued social goals; múgica was considered "the social conscience of cardenismo."
múgica resigned his cabinet post to be a candidate for the 1940 presidential election.
however, the political system was not one of open competition among candidates, although the prm's rules required an open convention to select the candidate.
cárdenas established the unwritten rule that the president chose his successor.
cárdenas chose political unknown manuel ávila camacho, far more centrist than múgica, as the prm's official candidate.
he was "known as a conciliator rather than a leader" and later derided as "the unknown soldier."
múgica withdrew, realizing his personal ambitions would not be satisfied, and went on to hold other posts in the government.
cárdenas may well have hoped ávila camacho would salvage some of his progressive policies and be a compromise candidate compared to his conservative opponent, general juan andreu almazán.
cárdenas is said to have secured the support of the ctm and the cnc for ávila camacho by personally guaranteeing their interests would be respected.
the campaign and elections were marked by violent incidents; on election-day the opposing parties hijacked numerous polling places and each issued their own "election results".
cárdenas himself was unable to vote on election day because the polling place closed early to prevent supporters of almazán from voting.
since the government controlled the electoral process, the official results declared ávila camacho as winner; almazán cried fraud and threatened revolt, trying to set up a parallel government and congress.
ávila camacho crushed almazán's forces and assumed office in december 1940. his inauguration was attended by us vice president-elect henry a. wallace, who was appointed by the u.s. as a "special representative with the rank of ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary" for mexico, indicating that the u.s. recognized the legitimacy of the election results.
almazán also attended ávila camacho's inauguration.
much to the surprise of mexicans who expected that cárdenas might follow the example of calles and remain the power behind the presidency—particularly since ávila camacho did not appear to have major leadership skills at a time that the conflict in europe and domestic turmoil were in evidence—he set the important precedent of leaving the presidency and its powers to his successor.
after his presidential term that ended december 1, 1940, cárdenas served as mexico's minister of war 1942–1945, when mexico was a solid participant in world war ii, which reassured mexican nationalists concerned about a close alliance with the united states.
it has been said that cárdenas was the only president associated with the institutional revolutionary party (pri) who did not use the office to make himself wealthy.
he retired to a modest home by lake pátzcuaro, michoacán, and worked the rest of his life supervising irrigation projects and promoting free medical clinics and education for the nation's poor.
he also continued to speak out about international political issues and in favor of greater democracy and human rights in latin america and elsewhere.
for example, he was one of the participants in the russell tribunal for investigating war crimes in vietnam.
although cárdenas did not play the role that calles had as the power behind the presidency, cárdenas did exert influence on the pri and in mexican politics.
he opposed the candidacy of miguel alemán valdés for president in 1952, opposed the vietnam war, and opposed the u.s. policy toward cuba after the 1959 cuban revolution.
cárdenas was not happy with the rightward shift of mexican presidents, starting with the presidency of miguel alemán (1946-1952).
during the presidency of adolfo lópez mateos (1958-1964), cárdenas emerged from retirement and pressed the president toward leftist stances.
with the triumph of the cuban revolution in january 1959, cárdenas among others in latin america who saw the hope of young revolution.
mexico was run by party that claimed the legacy of the mexican revolution but had turned away from revolutionary ideals.
cárdenas went to cuba in july 1959 and was with castro at a huge rally where the former guerrilla leader declared himself premier of cuba.
cárdenas returned to mexico with the hope that the ideals of the mexican revolution could be revived, with land reform, support for agriculture, and an expansion of education and health services to mexicans.
he also directly appealed to lópez mateos to free jailed union leaders.
lópez mateos became increasingly hostile to cárdenas, who was explicitly and implicitly rebuking him.
to cárdenas he said, "they say the communists are weaving a dangerous web around you."
the pressure on lópez mateos had an impact, and he began implementing reforms in land, education, and the creation of social programs that emulated those under cárdenas.
cárdenas withdrew his public challenge to the pri's policies and supported lópez mateos's designated successor in 1964, gustavo díaz ordaz, his minister of the interior.
in 1968 cárdenas did not anticipate the draconian crackdown by díaz ordaz in the run-up to the mexico city olympics.
that summer saw the emergence of the mexican movement of 1968, which mobilized tens of thousands of students and middle class supporters during the summer and early fall 1968. the movement ended in the bloody tlatelolco massacre on 2 october 1968. during the troubles that summer, one of cárdenas's long-time friends, heberto castillo martínez, a professor of mechanical engineering at the national university, actively participated in the movement and was pursued by díaz ordaz's secret police.
cárdenas hosted a meeting at his residence in the polanco section of mexico city with castillo and some student leaders.
cárdenas was increasingly concerned about the impact on the movement on the political peace that had been built by the party.
despite the national university being a center of the movement, cárdenas did not think that the government would violate the university's autonomy and take over the campus.
it did, with tanks rolling into campus on 18 september.
castillo had a harrowing escape.
in october government troops fired on demonstrators at the plaza of the three cultures in tlatelolco, someone who had been there made his way to cárdenas's house to tell him in tears what happened.
cárdenas's wife amalia reportedly said, "and i believe that the general shed some tears too."
cárdenas died of cancer in mexico city on october 19, 1970 at the age of 75. he is buried in the monument to the revolution in mexico city, sharing his final resting place with venustiano carranza, pancho villa, and plutarco elias calles.
cárdenas's son cuauhtémoc cárdenas and his grandson lázaro cárdenas batel have been prominent mexican politicians.
in his honor, his name was given to a number of cities, towns, and a municipality in mexico, including lázaro cárdenas, michoacán, the municipality of lázaro cárdenas, quintana roo, lázaro cárdenas, jalisco, and other smaller communities.
a major dam project on the nazas river named for him was inaugurated in 1946. there are also many streets that have been named after him, including the eje central lázaro cárdenas in mexico city and highways in guadalajara, monterrey and mexicali.
šetalište lazaro kardenasa (lázaro cárdenas promenade) in belgrade, serbia, is also named after him, as is a street in barcelona, spain, and a monument in a park in madrid dedicated to his memory for his role in admitting defeated spanish republicans to mexico after the civil war in that country.
in 1955, lázaro cárdenas was awarded the stalin peace prize, which was later renamed for lenin as part of de-stalinization.
president cárdenas and his administration are given credit by socialists for expanding the distribution of land to the peasants, establishing new welfare programs for the poor, and nationalizing the railroad and petroleum industries, including the oil company that cárdenas founded, petróleos mexicanos.
toward the end of his presidency, unhappy landowners and foreign capitalists began to challenge his programs and his power.
his choice of his close associate manuel ávila camacho rather than a candidate with a distinguished record as a revolutionary leader was displeasing to many, and occasioned a possible military revolt.
the party that cárdenas founded, the partido de la revolución mexicana (prm), established the basic structure of sectoral representation of important groups, a structure retained by its successor in 1946, the pri.
the pri continued in power until 2000. this is attributed by some to electoral fraud and coercion.
this legacy led his son, cuauhtémoc cárdenas, to form the democratic revolution party (prd) to contest the 1988 presidential election.
since that year, the prd has become one of the three major parties in mexico, gaining working class support that was previously enjoyed by the pri.
in his "political testament", written the year before his death and published posthumously, he acknowledged that his regime had failed to make the changes in distribution of political power and corruption that were the basis for his presidency and the revolution.
he expressed his dismay in the fact that some people and groups were making themselves rich to the detriment of the mainly poor majority.
it was said of cárdenas in a eulogy that "he was the greatest figure produced by the revolution... an authentic revolutionary who aspired to the greatness of his country, not personal aggrandizement.

philippine president ramon magsaysay patterned his people–oriented government on the principles which he found in a biography of cárdenas written by william cameron townsend.

juan santamaría (august 29, 1831 – april 12, 1856) was a drummer in the costa rican army, officially recognized as the national hero of his country.
a national holiday in costa rica, juan santamaría day, is held every april 11 to commemorate his death.
santamaría was born in the city of alajuela.
when u.s. filibuster william walker overthrew the government of nicaragua in 1856 and attempted to conquer the other nations in central america, including costa rica, in order to form a private slaveholding empire, costa rican president juan rafael mora porras called upon the general population to take up arms and march north to nicaragua to fight against the foreign invader.
this started the filibuster war.
santamaría, a poor laborer and the illegitimate son of a single mother joined the army as a drummer boy.
the troops nicknamed him "el erizo" ("the sea urchin") on account of his spiked hair.
after routing a small contingent of walker's soldiers at santa rosa, guanacaste, the costa rican troops continued marching north and reached the city of rivas, nicaragua, on april 8, 1856. the battle that ensued is known as the second battle of rivas.
combat was fierce and the costa ricans were not able to drive walker's men out of a hostel near the town center from which they commanded an advantageous firing position.
according to the traditional account, on april 11, salvadoran general josé maría cañas suggested that one of the soldiers advance towards the hostel with a torch and set it on fire.
some soldiers tried and failed, but santamaría finally volunteered on the condition that in the event of his death, someone would look after his mother.
he then advanced and was mortally wounded by enemy fire.
before expiring he succeeded, however, in setting fire to the hostel, thus contributing decisively to the costa rican victory at rivas.
this account is apparently supported by a petition for a state pension filed in november 1857 by santamaría's mother, as well as by government documents showing that the pension was granted.
various historians, however, have questioned whether the account is accurate and whether santamaria died during that battle or another one.
at any rate, towards the end of the 19th century, costa rican intellectuals and politicians seized on the war against walker and on the figure of santamaría for nationalist purposes.
santamaría is honored by a statue in a park bearing his name in the central canton of alajuela one block south of the central park, and by a museum that was a former garrison in the same city.
two larger-than-life statues of juan santamaria are in costa rica: one in alajuela and other in the front of the congress in san jose.
the statue was commissioned by the costa rican government in 1891, under sworn statement or affidavit of several witness of his deed in rivas, a perpetual memorial archive has been preserved.
as a drummer of the armed forces, he wore a uniform that was evidently of french design since in the 19th century, most high-ranking officers were trained in france.
the main international airport in costa rica is named after him.
in 1891, pedro calderón navarro and emilio pacheco cooper composed an anthem, himno patriótico a juan santamaría, 11 de abril, to juan santamaría.
it was sung for the first time during the juan santamaria statue inauguration on the 15 of september of 1891. the lyrics are as follows:
cantemos ufanos la egregia memoriade aquel de la patria soldado inmortal,a quien hoy unidas la fama y lahistoria entonan gozosas un himno triunfal.cantemos al héroe que en rivas, pujante,de marte desprecia el fiero crujire, intrépido, alzando su tea fulgurantevuela por la patria, sonriendo, a morir.miradle, en su diestra la tea vengadoraagita, y avanza de su hazaña en pos;la muerte, ¿qué importa truene asoladora,si siente en el pecho las iras de un dios?y avanza y avanza; el plomo homicidalo hiere sin tregua e infúndele ardor,y en tanto que heroico exhala la vidase escucha el incendio rugir vengador.¡salud, noble atleta!
(3) tu nombre gloriosoun pueblo que es libre lo aclama hoy doquierun pueblo que siempre luchó valeroso,pues sabe que es grande, “cual tú”, perecer.
the tomb of marcus vergilius eurysaces the baker is one of the largest and best-preserved freedman funerary monuments in rome.
its sculpted frieze is a classic example of the "plebeian style" in roman sculpture.
eurysaces built the tomb for himself and perhaps also his wife atistia around the end of the republic (ca.
50-20 bc).
located in a prominent position just outside today's porta maggiore, the tomb was transformed by its incorporation into the aurelian wall; a tower subsequently erected by honorius covered the tomb, the remains of which were exposed upon its removal by gregory xvi in 1838. what is particularly significant about this extravagant tomb is that it was built by a freedman, a former slave.
three sides of the slightly trapezoidal structure remain largely intact.
all have the same form, with over a plain lower storey, now mostly below ground level but exposed, a storey consisting of pairs of engaged columns between flat slabs, all crammed together with no space in between.
the effect is far from the classical orders; at the corners the slabs turn to pilasters rising at the top level to unorthodox capitals combining scrolls at the sides with plant forms in the centre.
there are unusual circular openings in the topmost storey, now thought to represent kneading-basins or grain-measuring vessels.
below a cornice is the frieze, with continuous scenes in relief showing the operation of the bakery where eurystaces made what was evidently a considerable fortune.
reconstructions imagine a gently rising roof above this, now lost.
although there is no conclusive statement on the monument that eurysaces was a freedman - there is no "l" for libertus in the inscription – there are a number of reasons for believing that this was the case.
his name takes the form of a roman praenomen and nomen followed by a greek cognomen, nomenclature typical for a freedman, combining as it does the identity of the former owning family with that of the individual when a slave.
the inscription also lacks the filiation usual for the freeborn.
the banausic and labour-intensive activities commemorated, those of baking, are not usually celebrated by the freeborn upper classes.
the unusual form of the monument and of its inscription have also been used to locate eurysaces as a nouveau riche parvenu in the manner of trimalchio, with his "naïve ostentation" vulgarly imitative of élite culture.
the slightly later pyramid of cestius is another individualistic tomb for an evidently wealthy man outside the traditional élite; in this case it perhaps referred to his taking part in campaigns in nubia.
burial within the pomerium or sacred boundary of the city was generally prohibited.
although the precise extent of the pomerium at the various stages of its history is uncertain, it is believed to have later been coterminous with the aurelian walls, perhaps extending to the area of the porta maggiore after its expansion by claudius.
streets of tombs in a prominent position just outside the city gates are known from pompeii as well as the via appia.
eurysaces' tomb, at the junction of the via praenestina and via labicana just before entering rome, was in a particularly prominent position, and its trapezoidal form was likely dictated by the space available.
other burial complexes in the vicinity are known, including the columbarium of statilius taurus, consul at the time of augustus, with over seven hundred loculi or burial niches; and the first century bc tomb of the societas cantorum graecorum (association of greek singers).
an inscription relating to another baker, ogulnius, has also been found in local excavations.
[note 1]
the tomb, dwarfed by the later aqua claudia, rises to a height of some thirty-three feet.
of concrete faced with travertine on a tufa base, it stands as a monument both to eurysaces and, through the frieze, to the wider profession of baking.
the style, very different from the classical roman styles of tombs, makes eurysaces' tomb stand out.
the surviving part of the inscription reads "est hoc monimentvm marcei vergilei evrysacis pistoris redemptoris apparet," or in english, "this is the monument of marcus vergilius eurysaces, baker, contractor, public servant."
while the final word in this quote, "apparet", is often translated as public servant, the actual latin word for a public servant is apparitor.
apparet is a verb meaning to appear or make apparent, this translation however does not seem to fit the rest of the inscription.
the word apparet is yet to be translated within the context of this quotation.
in the bbc documentary meet the romans with mary beard, professor mary beard, translates "apparet" as "it's obvious!"
beard suggests "apparet" is signalling a joke, as if to say "get it?!".
thus beard translates the epitaph as "this is the monument of marcus vergilius eurysaces, baker, contractor, it's obvious."
a relief representing various stages of bread production runs along the top of the tomb.
the relief depicts, on the south side, the delivery and grinding of grain and sifting of flour; on the north, the mixing and kneading of dough, forming of round loaves, and baking in a domed "pizza-type" oven; and, on the west, the stacking of loaves in baskets and their being taken for weighing.
during demolition of the superimposed late antique fortifications by pope gregory xvi in 1838, a full-length relief portrait was discovered of a man and woman in toga and palla (taken to the palazzo dei conservatori); along with an inscription honouring one atistia, a good wife whose remains were placed in a breadbasket; and an urn taking the form of such a breadbasket.
[note 2] theft of the female head from the relief in 1934 and uncertainty as to the present whereabouts of the urn, believed to be somewhere in the museo nazionale romano, mean their study is now conducted from excavation drawings and early photographs.
reconstructions generally relate these items to the tomb on the grounds of their style, subject matter, and findspot, with atistia becoming eurysaces' wife, and the double relief and inscription occupying the upper register of the now lost east facade of the tomb.
this tomb is one of many lavish tombs created by freedmen.
these men were at first slaves, but, from the help of their masters, they were able to buy their freedom and begin their own livelihoods.
they were proud of their freedom and earnings.
because of this, they many times created such lavish funerary monuments, such as eurysaces' tomb.
these freedmen had no family lines, which were important in roman society.
therefore, these tombs may have been attempts at beginning a family history for future generations to appreciate.

the venetian arsenal (italian: arsenale di venezia) is a complex of former shipyards and armories clustered together in the city of venice in northern italy.
owned by the state, the arsenal was responsible for the bulk of the venetian republic's naval power during the middle part of the second millennium ad.
it was "one of the earliest large-scale industrial enterprises in history".
construction of the arsenal began around 1104, during venice's republican era.
it became the largest industrial complex in europe before the industrial revolution, spanning an area of about 45 hectares (110 acres), or about fifteen percent of venice.
surrounded by a 2-mile (3.2 km) rampart, laborers and shipbuilders regularly worked within the arsenal, building ships that sailed from the city's port.
with high walls shielding the arsenal from public view and guards protecting its perimeter, different areas of the arsenal each produced a particular prefabricated ship part or other maritime implement, such as munitions, rope, and rigging.
these parts could then be assembled into a ship in as little as one day.
an exclusive forest owned by the arsenal navy, in the montello hills area of veneto, provided the arsenal's wood supply.
the arsenal produced the majority of venice's maritime trading vessels, which generated much of the city's economic wealth and power, lasting until the fall of the venetian republic to napoleon in 1797. it is located in the castello district of venice, and it is now owned by the state.
the byzantine-style establishment may have existed as early as the 8th century, though the present structure is usually said to have been begun in 1104 during the reign of ordelafo faliero, although there is no evidence for such a precise date.
it definitely existed by the early 13th century.
however, if this date is precise, that would make the factory 916 years old today (2020).
initially the state dockyard worked merely to maintain privately built naval ships, but in 1320 the arsenale nuovo (italian: new arsenal) was built, much larger than the original.
it enabled all the state's navy and the larger merchant ships to be both constructed and maintained in one place.
the arsenal incidentally became an important center for rope manufacture, and housing for the arsenal workers grew up outside its walls.
venice developed methods of mass-producing warships in the arsenal, including the frame-first system to replace the roman hull-first practice.
this new system was much faster and required less wood.
at the peak of its efficiency in the early 16th century, the arsenal employed some 16,000 people who apparently were able to produce nearly one ship each day, and could fit out, arm, and provision a newly built galley with standardized parts on a production-line basis not seen again until the industrial revolution.
the staff of the arsenal, who were united by their distinct professional identity, also developed new firearms at an early date, beginning with bombards in the 1370s and numerous small arms for use against the genoese a few years later.
the muzzle velocity of handguns was improved beyond that of the crossbow, creating armor-piercing rounds.
arsenal-produced arms were also noteworthy for their multi-purpose utility; the venetian condottieri leader, bartolomeo colleoni, is usually given credit as being the first to mount the arsenal's new lighter-weight artillery on mobile carriages for field use.
the arsenal's main gate, the porta magna, was built around 1460 and was one of the very first works of venetian renaissance architecture.
it was based on the roman arch of the sergii, a triumphal arch in pula in istra, now in croatia but then venetian territory.
it was perhaps built by antonio gambello from a design by jacopo bellini.
two lions taken from greece situated beside it were added in 1687. one of the lions, known as the piraeus lion, has runic defacements carved in it by invading scandinavian mercenaries during the 11th century.
in the late 16th century, the arsenal's designers experimented with larger ships as platforms for heavy naval guns.
the largest was the galleass, already used at the  battle of lepanto against the ottoman turks, and developed from the old merchanting "great galley".
it was huge, propelled by both sails and oars, with guns mounted on wheeled carriages along the sides in the modern fashion.
it was slow and unwieldy in battle, however, and few were ever built.
the galleon, also developed at the arsenal, was an armed sailing ship, a slimmer version of the merchant "round ship".
it was useful in major naval battles, but not in the small bays and off the extensive lee shores of the dalmatian coast.
significant parts of the arsenal were destroyed under napoleonic rule, and later rebuilt to enable the arsenal's present use as a naval base.
it is also used as a research center and an exhibition venue during the venice biennale, and is home to a historic boat preservation center.
the venetian arsenal's ability to mass-produce galleys on an almost assembly-line process was unique for its time and resulted in possibly the single largest industrial complex in europe prior to the industrial revolution.
so much so, that it was mentioned in dante's inferno:
as in the arsenal of the venetiansboils in winter the tenacious pitchto smear their unsound vessels over againfor sail they cannot; and instead thereofone makes his vessel new, and one recaulksthe ribs of that which many a voyage has madeone hammers at the prow, one at the sternthis one makes oars and that one cordage twistsanother mends the mainsail and the mizzen…
the arsenal's  capacity for production was rare in a time when "most of europe had no manufacturing abilities more efficient than the guild system, the slow and tradition-bound way craftsmen had of passing on skills to their sons or apprentices while monopolizing production and sale of craft pieces in a given region... the arsenal was something different, a harbinger of future times."
the venetian arsenal was not the mass production facility that it was to be until about 1320 with the creation of the arsenale nuovo.
the arsenale nuovo was simply a larger and more efficient version of the original.
prior to this time the arsenal had served mainly as a place to maintain privately built ships.
with the creation of the arsenale nuovo, and the development and introduction of the great galley, the venetian arsenal would start to take on its industrial form.
the invention of the great galley itself is significant because they were able to be built frame-first.
this process used less timber than the earlier hull-first building system, resulting in much faster build times.
this was crucial to the process that would lead to the arsenal becoming a mass-production center.
by the 16th century, the arsenal had become the most powerful and efficient shipbuilding enterprise in the world.
not only did it supply ships, rigging, and other nautical supplies, it was also a major munitions depot for the venetian navy and was capable of outfitting and producing fully equipped merchant or naval vessels at the rate of one per day.
in the rest of europe the production of a similar sized vessel could often take months.
this large production capacity was a result of the massive number of people that the arsenal employed, almost 16,000, and the streamlining of production within the arsenal itself.
production was divided into 3 main stages: framing, planking and cabins, and final assembly.
each stage employed its own workers who specialized in that particular stage of production as well as using standardized parts to produce an almost assembly-line process.
the arsenal often kept up to 100 galleys in different stages of production and maintenance.
that way, once a galley was launched, another could be immediately put into the finishing stages of production.
the layout of the arsenal itself was modified to enable minimal handling of materials during the stages of production.
the arsenal also saw the use of standardized, interchangeable parts.
one revolutionary aspect of the arsenal was its employment of the moving assembly line.
the galleys, through the use of a canal, were moved along during their  stages of construction, allowing them to be brought to the materials and workers, instead of the materials and workers going to the galley itself.
this  assembly approach was repeated in the rest of the world only starting from the early 20th century when henry ford began using the modern assembly line.
in 1593, galileo became a consultant to the arsenal, advising military engineers and instrument makers and helping to solve shipbuilders' problems, many of them relating to matters of ballistics.
he was also responsible for creating some major innovations in the production and logistics of the arsenal.
as a result of his interactions with the arsenal, galileo published a book later in his life addressing a new field of modern science, that concerned with the strength and resistance of materials.
this science largely saw its roots in the knowledge of the shipwrights of the venetian arsenal.
it is also supposed that galileo's initial visits to the arsenal were as a result of his initiative to further investigate aristotle's questions concerning shipbuilding and navigation, found in the mechanical questions of aristotle.
as a result of these investigations, which were pursued by observing the work of the shipwrights, galileo was asked to help in resolving a specific problem with the rowing units of the galleys.
as a result of his study of aristotle, and in particular question 4 regarding the propulsion of ships by oar, galileo was able to produce a response to this question and ended up becoming a major source of information for the shipbuilders of the arsenal concerning matters of rowing, instruments, and ballistics.
venice's wealth and power rested in its ability to control trade in the mediterranean.
this would not have been possible without an extremely large navy and merchant force.
by 1450, over 3,000 venetian merchant ships were in operation, both as supply ships for venetian merchants and as warships for the venetian navy.
the fleet required constant maintenance and outfitting.
the venetian arsenal was not only able to function as a major shipyard, but was also responsible for these routine maintenance stops that most venetian galleys required.
this required financing, for which the venetian government spent almost 10% of its revenues.
this naval power resulted in the domination of mediterranean commerce.
venice's leading families, largely merchants and noblemen, were responsible for creating some of the grandest palaces and employing some of the most famous artists ever known.
this opulence and wealth would not have been possible without the naval force constructed by the arsenal.
with the creation of the great galley and the mass production capacity of the arsenal, "the fleets of venice were the basis for the greatest commercial power the european world had yet seen".
venice built an arsenal in corfu as part of a network of venetian arsenals, serving primarily the purpose of repair, and naval stations in greece, including shipyards in the aegean sea, epirus, the peloponnese and the kingdom of candia (modern crete).
aside from corfu, such locations in greece included methoni, koroni, chalkis, preveza, chania and heraklion.
the arsenal at gouvia in corfu was supposed to be used for ship repairs during the winter after the two fleets stationed on the island had returned from their yearly campaign during peacetime.
the arsenal was also used as storage for the venetian ships.
however, the venetian senate, in order to protect the operations of its own arsenal in venice, chose to limit the kind of repair activities undertaken at  the corfu arsenal.
consequently, the shipyard operations at gouvia were restricted to basic maintenance such as cleaning and caulking, and many captains instead of repairing their damaged ships at the arsenal chose to sink them.
as time went on, the number of ships being serviced at the location declined.

the captain william clark monument, also known as naming of mt.
jefferson, is an outdoor monument commemorating william clark by art professor michael florin dente, installed on the university of portland campus, in portland, oregon, united states.
the memorial was dedicated on december 11, 1988, and features 7-foot (2.1 m) bronze sculptures of clark, york, and an unnamed native american on a 4-foot (1.2 m) base.
the boyne obelisk (irish: obelisk bóinne), also known as king william's obelisk, was an obelisk located in oldbridge, near drogheda, county louth, ireland.
the monument was erected in order to commemorate william of orange's victory over king james ii at the battle of the boyne in 1690, and was located near the spot where william's forces crossed the river boyne to engage james' forces.
the foundation stone was laid on 17 april 1736 by lionel sackville, lord lieutenant of ireland.
the obelisk stood until 31 may 1923, when it was destroyed during the irish civil war by members of the national army, allegedly using three landmines stolen from a nearby irish army camp.
only a small stump remains of the former monument.
the obelisk was made from granite and was built upon a 9 metre (30 ft) high mound of rock located on the north bank of the river boyne.
at a height of 53 metres (174 ft) itself, it was both the tallest man-made structure in ireland and the tallest obelisk in europe at the time of its construction.
it initially stood adjacent to a wooden bridge spanning the river, which was later replaced by a lattice iron bridge that was built in 1869 and named the obelisk bridge, after the monument.
the square base of the obelisk bore an inscription on each of its sides.
the north side inscription read:
sacred to the glorious memory of king william the third, who, on the 1st of july, 1690, passed the river near this place to attack james the second, and did, on that day, by a single battle, secure to us and to our posterity, our liberty, laws, and religion.
in consequence of this action james ii left this kingdom and fled to france.
this memorial of our deliverance was erected in the 9th year of king george ii, the first stone being laid by lionel sackville, duke of dorset, lord lieutenant of the kingdom of ireland, mdccxxxvi
the south side inscription read:
marshal the duke of schomberg in passing this river died bravely fighting
the east side inscription read:
in defence of liberty, july 1st mdclxxxx
the west side inscription read:
this monument was erected by the grateful contributions of several protestants of great britain and ireland
tineretului statue (also called fallen angel or the straja youth monument) is a monument in romania near the danube–black sea canal, designed by pavel bucur.
the monument is dedicated to the union of communist youth.
the stainless steel structure rests on a three-sided concrete base.
according to the designer, the form is an abstraction of a flame, which represents the body of a fallen angel.
the original design included a pair of wings, but they were not installed, due to concerns about their structural integrity.
bronze plates with bas-reliefs once covered the concrete base.
they depicted the construction of the canal, and politicians elena ceaușescu and nicolae ceaușescu.
the bronze plaques were stolen some time after the 1989 romanian revolution, in c. 2000. the bronze plates were estimated to weigh between 5 and 19 tons.
one of the original inscriptions makes reference to the labor camps that were used to build the canal.
it reads (in romanian): .mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0}
future generations know that we have sacrificed ourselves for the ascension of the fatherland.
steel plates have also been removed, and parts of the statue have been painted with graffiti.
some of the bronze plates were recovered from a recycling center.

the texas african american history memorial is an outdoor monument commemorating the impact of african americans in texas, installed on the texas state capitol grounds in austin, texas, united states.
the memorial was sculpted by ed dwight and erected by the texas african american history memorial foundation in 2016. it describes african american history from the 1500s to present, and includes depictions of hendrick arnold and barbara jordan, as well as juneteenth (june 19, 1865), when african americans were emancipated.
the volunteer firemen monument is an outdoor memorial commemorating texan volunteer firefighters who died while in service, installed on the texas state capitol grounds in austin, texas, united states.
it was erected by the state firemen's association of texas in 1896, and modified in 1905. the monument features a bronze sculpture of a fireman carrying a child in his left arm and a lantern in his opposite, designed by j. segesman.
the statue rests on a granite base designed by frank teich, which has a ring of granite pillars with inscribed names of volunteers.
according to the texas state preservation board, the memorial has "historical omissions and errors", which have been kept.
ludwig van beethoven[n 1] (/ˈlʊdvɪɡ væn ˈbeɪt(h)oʊvən/ (listen); german: [ˈluːtvɪç fan ˈbeːthoːfn̩] (listen); baptised 17 december 1770 – 26 march 1827) was a german composer and pianist; his music is amongst the most performed of the classical repertoire and he is one of the most admired composers in the history of western music.
his works span the transition between the classical and romantic eras in classical music.
his career has conventionally been divided into early, middle, and late periods.
the "early" period in which he forged his craft, is typically seen to last until 1802. his "middle" period, (sometimes characterised as "heroic") shows an individual development from the "classical" styles of joseph haydn and wolfgang amadeus mozart, covers the years 1802 to 1812, during which he increasingly suffered from deafness.
in the "late" period from 1812 to his death in 1827, he extended his innovations in musical form and expression.
beethoven was born in bonn.
his musical talent was obvious at an early age, and he was initially harshly and intensively taught by his father johann van beethoven.
he was later taught by the composer and conductor christian gottlob neefe, under whose tuition he published his first work, a set of keyboard variations, in 1783. he found relief from a dysfunctional home life with the family of helene von breuning, whose children he loved, befriended and taught piano.
at age 21, he moved to vienna which subsequently became his base, and studied composition with haydn.
beethoven then gained a reputation as a virtuoso pianist, and he was soon courted by karl alois, prince lichnowsky for compositions, which resulted in his three opus 1 piano trios (the earliest works to which he accorded an opus number) in 1795.
his first major orchestral work, the first symphony, appeared in 1800, and his first set of string quartets was published in 1801. during this period, his hearing began to deteriorate, but he continued to conduct, premiering his third and fifth symphonies in 1804 and 1808, respectively.
his violin concerto appeared in 1806. his last piano concerto (no.
5, op.
73, known as the 'emperor'), dedicated to his great patron archduke rudolf of austria, was premiered in 1810, but not with the composer as soloist.
he was almost completely deaf by 1814, and he then gave up performing and appearing in public.
his problems with health and his unfulfilled personal life are exemplified by his "heiligenstadt testament" (1802) and his unsent letter to his "immortal beloved" (1812).
in the years from 1810, increasingly less socially involved, beethoven composed many of his most admired works including his later symphonies and his mature chamber music and piano sonatas.
his only opera fidelio, which had been first performed in 1805, was revised to its final version in 1814. he composed his missa solemnis in the years 1819–1823, and his final, ninth, symphony, one of the first examples of a choral symphony, in 1822–1824.
written in his last years, his late string quartets of 1825–26 are amongst his final achievements.
after some months of bedridden illness he died in 1827. beethoven's works in all genres remain mainstays of the classical music repertoire.
beethoven was the grandson of ludwig van beethoven (1712–1773), a musician from the town of mechelen in the austrian duchy of brabant (in what is now the flemish region of belgium) who had moved to bonn at the age of 21. ludwig was employed as a bass singer at the court of clemens august, archbishop-elector of cologne, eventually rising to become, in 1761, kapellmeister (music director) and hence a pre-eminent musician in bonn.
the portrait he commissioned of himself towards the end of his life remained displayed in his grandson's rooms as a talisman of his musical heritage.
ludwig had one son, johann (1740–1792), who worked as a tenor in the same musical establishment and gave keyboard and violin lessons to supplement his income.
johann married maria magdalena keverich in 1767; she was the daughter of heinrich keverich (1701–1751), who had been the head chef at the court of the archbishopric of trier.
beethoven was born of this marriage in bonn.
there is no authentic record of the date of his birth; however, the registry of his baptism, in the catholic parish of st. remigius on 17 december 1770, survives, and the custom in the region at the time was to carry out baptism within 24 hours of birth.
there is a consensus, (with which beethoven himself agreed) that his birth date was 16 december, but no documentary proof of this.
of the seven children born to johann van beethoven, only ludwig, the second-born, and two younger brothers survived infancy.
kaspar anton karl was born on 8 april 1774, and nikolaus johann, the youngest, was born on 2 october 1776.
beethoven's first music teacher was his father.
he later had other local teachers: the court organist gilles van den eeden (d. 1782), tobias friedrich pfeiffer (a family friend, who provided keyboard tuition), and franz rovantini (a relative, who instructed him in playing the violin and viola).
from the outset his tuition regime, which began in his fifth year, was harsh and intensive, often reducing him to tears; with the involvement of the insomniac pfeiffer there were irregular late-night sessions with the young beethoven being dragged from his bed to the keyboard.
his musical talent was obvious at a young age.
johann, aware of leopold mozart's successes in this area (with his son wolfgang and daughter nannerl), attempted to promote his son as a child prodigy, claiming that beethoven was six (he was seven) on the posters for his first public performance in march 1778.
in 1780 or 1781, beethoven began his studies with his most important teacher in bonn, christian gottlob neefe.
neefe taught him composition; in march 1783 appeared beethoven's first published work, a set of keyboard variations (woo 63).
[n 2] beethoven soon began working with neefe as assistant organist, at first unpaid (1782), and then as a paid employee (1784) of the court chapel.
his first three piano sonatas, woo 47, sometimes known as "kurfürst" ("elector") for their dedication to the elector maximilian friedrich (1708–1784), were published in 1783. in the same year the first printed reference to beethoven appeared in the magazin der musik – "louis van beethoven [sic] ... a boy of 11 years and most promising talent.
he plays the piano very skilfully and with power, reads at sight very well ... the chief piece he plays is das wohltempierte klavier of sebastian bach, which herr neefe puts into his hands ..." maximilian friedrich's successor as the elector of bonn was maximilian franz.
he gave some support to beethoven, appointing him court organist and paying towards his visit to vienna of 1792.
he was introduced in these years to several people who became important in his life.
he often visited the cultivated von breuning family, where he taught piano to some of the children, and where the widowed frau von breuning offered him a motherly friendship.
here he also met franz wegeler, a young medical student, who became a lifelong friend (and was to marry one of the von breuning daughters).
the von breuning family environment offered an alternative to his home life, which was increasingly dominated by his father's decline.
another frequenter of the von breunings was count ferdinand von waldstein, who became a friend and financial supporter during beethoven's bonn period.
.
waldstein was to commission in 1791 beethoven's first work for the stage, the ballet musik zu einem ritterballett (woo 1).
in the period 1785–90 there is virtually no record of beethoven's activity as a composer.
this may be attributed to the lukewarm response his initial publications had attracted, and also to ongoing problems in the beethoven family.
his mother died in 1787, shortly after beethoven’s first visit to vienna, where he stayed for about two weeks and almost certainly met with mozart.. in 1789 beethoven's father was forcibly retired from the service of the court (as a consequence of his alcoholism) and it was ordered that half of his father's pension be paid directly to him for support of the family.
he contributed further to the family's income by teaching (to which wegeler said he had "an extraordinary aversion") and by playing viola in the court orchestra.
this familiarized him with a variety of operas, including works by mozart, gluck and paisiello.
here he also befriended anton reicha, a composer, flautist and violinist of about his own age who was a nephew of the court orchestra's conductor, josef reicha.
from 1790 to 1792, beethoven composed a number of works (none were published at the time) showing a growing range and maturity.
musicologists have identified a theme similar to those of his third symphony in a set of variations written in 1791. it was perhaps on neefe's recommendation that beethoven received his first commissions; the literary society in bonn commissioned a cantata to mark the occasion of the death in 1790 of joseph ii (woo 87),  and a further cantata, to celebrate the subsequent accession of leopold ii as holy roman emperor (woo 88), may have been commissioned by the elector.. these two emperor cantatas were never performed at the time and they remained lost until the 1880s, when they were described by the composer johannes brahms as "beethoven through and through" and as such prophetic of the style which would mark his music as distinct from the classical tradition.
beethoven was probably first introduced to joseph haydn in late 1790, when the latter was travelling to london and stopped in bonn around christmas time.
a year and a half later, they met in bonn on haydn's return trip from london to vienna in july 1792, when beethoven played in the orchestra at the redoute in godesberg.
it is likely that arrangements were made at that time for beethoven to study with the older master.
waldstein wrote to him before his departure: “you are going to vienna in fulfilment of your long-frustrated wishes […] with the help of assiduous labour you shall receive mozart’s spirit from haydn’s hands.”
beethoven left bonn for vienna in november 1792, amid rumours of war spilling out of france; he learned shortly after his arrival that his father had died.
over the next few years, beethoven responded to the widespread feeling that he was a successor to the recently deceased mozart by studying that master's work and writing works with a distinctly mozartean flavour.
he did not immediately set out to establish himself as a composer, but rather devoted himself to study and performance.
working under haydn's direction, he sought to master counterpoint.
he also studied violin under ignaz schuppanzigh.
early in this period, he also began receiving occasional instruction from antonio salieri, primarily in italian vocal composition style; this relationship persisted until at least 1802, and possibly as late as 1809.
with haydn's departure for england in 1794, beethoven was expected by the elector to return home to bonn.
he chose instead to remain in vienna, continuing his instruction in counterpoint with johann albrechtsberger and other teachers.
in any case, by this time it must have seemed clear to his employer that bonn would fall to the french, as it did in october 1794, effectively leaving beethoven without a stipend or the necessity to return.
however, a number of viennese noblemen had already recognised his ability and offered him financial support, among them prince joseph franz lobkowitz, prince karl lichnowsky, and baron gottfried van swieten.
assisted by his connections with haydn and waldstein, beethoven began to develop a reputation as a performer and improviser in the salons of the viennese nobility.
his friend nikolaus simrock began publishing his compositions, starting with a set of keyboard variations on a theme of dittersdorf (woo 66).
by 1793, he had established a reputation in vienna as a piano virtuoso, but he apparently withheld works from publication so that their eventual appearance would have greater impact.
his first public performance in vienna was in march 1795, where he first performed one of his piano concertos.
[n 3] shortly after this performance, he arranged for the publication of the first of his compositions to which he assigned an opus number, the three piano trios, opus 1. these works were dedicated to his patron prince lichnowsky, and were a financial success; beethoven's profits were nearly sufficient to cover his living expenses for a year.
in 1799 beethoven participated in (and won) a notorious piano 'duel' at the home of baron raimund wetzlar (a former patron of mozart) against the virtuoso joseph wölfl; and in the following year he similarly triumphed against daniel steibelt at the salon of count moritz von fries.
beethoven's eighth piano sonata the "pathétique"  (op.
13), published in 1799 is described by the musicologist barry cooper as "surpass[ing] any of his previous compositions, in strength of character, depth of emotion, level of originality, and ingenuity of motivic and tonal manipulation."
beethoven composed his first six string quartets (op.
18) between 1798 and 1800 (commissioned by, and dedicated to, prince lobkowitz).
they were published in 1801. he also completed his septet (op.
20) in 1799, which was one of his most popular works during his lifetime.
with premieres of his first and second symphonies in 1800 and 1803, he became regarded as one of the most important of a generation of young composers following haydn and mozart.
but his melodies, musical development, use of modulation and texture, and characterisation of emotion all set him apart from his influences, and heightened the impact some of his early works made when they were first published.
for the premiere of his first symphony, he hired the burgtheater on 2 april 1800, and staged an extensive programme, including works by haydn and mozart, as well as his septet, the symphony, and one of his piano concertos (the latter three works all then unpublished).
the concert, which the allgemeine musikalische zeitung described as "the most interesting concert in a long time," was not without difficulties; among the criticisms was that "the players did not bother to pay any attention to the soloist."
by the end of 1800, beethoven and his music were already much in demand from patrons and publishers.
in may 1799, he taught piano to the daughters of hungarian countess anna brunsvik.
during this time, he fell in love with the younger daughter josephine.
amongst his other students, from 1801 to 1805, he tutored ferdinand ries, who went on to become a composer and later wrote about their encounters.
the young carl czerny, who later became a renowned music teacher himself, studied with beethoven from 1801 to 1803. in late 1801, he met a young countess, julie ("giulietta") guicciardi, through the brunsvik family; he mentions his love for julie in a november 1801 letter to a friend, but class difference prevented any consideration of pursuing this.
he later dedicated his sonata no.
14, now commonly known as the moonlight sonata, to her.
in the spring of 1801 he completed the creatures of prometheus, a ballet.
the work received numerous performances in 1801 and 1802, and he rushed to publish a piano arrangement to capitalise on its early popularity.
in the spring of 1802 he completed the second symphony, intended for performance at a concert that was cancelled.
the symphony received its premiere instead at a subscription concert in april 1803 at the theater an der wien, where he had been appointed composer in residence.
in addition to the second symphony, the concert also featured the first symphony, the third piano concerto, and the oratorio christ on the mount of olives.
reviews were mixed, but the concert was a financial success; he was able to charge three times the cost of a typical concert ticket.
his business dealings with publishers also began to improve in 1802 when his brother kaspar, who had previously assisted him casually, began to assume a larger role in the management of his affairs.
in addition to negotiating higher prices for recently composed works, kaspar also began selling some of his earlier unpublished compositions, and encouraged him (against beethoven's preference) to also make arrangements and transcriptions of his more popular works for other instrument combinations.
beethoven acceded to these requests, as he could not prevent publishers from hiring others to do similar arrangements of his works.
beethoven told the english pianist charles neate (in 1815) that he dated his hearing loss from a fit he suffered in 1798 induced by a quarrel with a singer.. during its gradual decline, his hearing was further impeded by a severe form of tinnitus.
as early as 1801, he wrote to wegeler and another friend karl amenda, describing his symptoms and the difficulties they caused in both professional and social settings (although it is likely some of his close friends were already aware of the problems).
the cause was probably otosclerosis, perhaps accompanied by degeneration of the auditory nerve.
[n 4]
on the advice of his doctor, he moved to the small austrian town of heiligenstadt, just outside vienna, from april to october 1802 in an attempt to come to terms with his condition.
there he wrote the document now known as the “heiligenstadt testament”, a letter to his brothers which records his thoughts of suicide due to his growing deafness and records his resolution to continue living for and through his art.
the letter was never actually sent and was discovered in the composer’s papers after his death.
the letters to wegeler and amenda were not so despairing; in them beethoven commented also on his ongoing professional and financial success at this period, and his determination, as he expressed it to wegeler, to “seize fate by the throat; it shall certainly not crush me completely.” in 1806, beethoven noted on of his musical sketches "let your deafness no longer be a secret – even in art.
".
beethoven's hearing loss did not prevent him from composing music, but it made playing at concerts—a important source of income at this phase of his life—increasingly difficult.
(it also contributed substantially to his social withdrawal.)
czerny remarked however that beethoven could still hear speech and music normally until 1812.
beethoven’s return to vienna from heiligenstadt was marked by a change in musical style, and is now often designated as the start of his middle or "heroic" period characterised by many original works composed on a grand scale.
according to carl czerny, beethoven said, "i am not satisfied with the work i have done so far.
from now on i intend to take a new way."
an early major work employing this new style was the third symphony in e flat op.
55, known as the eroica, written in 1803-4. the idea of creating a symphony based on the career of napoleon may have been suggested to beethoven by count bernadotte in 1798. beethoven, sympathetic to the ideal of the heroic revolutionary leader, originally gave the symphony the title "bonaparte", but disillusioned by napoleon declaring himself emperor in 1804, he scratched napoleon's name from the manuscript's title page, and the symphony was published in 1806 with its present title and the subtitle "to celebrate the memory of a great man."
the eroica was longer and larger in scope than any previous symphony.
when it premiered in early 1805 it received a mixed reception.
some listeners objected to its length or misunderstood its structure, while others viewed it as a masterpiece.
other middle period works extend in the same dramatic manner the musical language beethoven had inherited.
the rasumovsky string quartets, and the waldstein and appassionata piano sonatas share the heroic spirit of the third symphony.. other works of this period include the fourth through eighth symphonies,   the oratorio christ on the mount of olives, the opera fidelio, and the violin concerto.
beethoven was hailed in 1810 by the writer and composer e. t. a. hoffmann, in an influential review in the allgemeine musikalische zeitung, as the  greatest of (what he considered) the three "romantic" composers, (that is, ahead of haydn and mozart); in beethoven's fifth symphony his music "sets in motion terror, fear, horror, pain, and awakens the infinite yearning that is the essence of romanticism".
during this time his income came from publishing his works, from performances of them, and from his patrons, for whom he gave private performances and copies of works they commissioned for an exclusive period prior to their publication.
some of his early patrons, including prince lobkowitz and prince lichnowsky, gave him annual stipends in addition to commissioning works and purchasing published works.
perhaps his most important aristocratic patron was archduke rudolf of austria , archbishop of olomouc and cardinal-priest, and the youngest son of emperor leopold ii, who in 1803 or 1804 began to study piano and composition with him.
they became friends, and their meetings continued until 1824. beethoven was to dedicate 14 compositions to rudolph, including the archduke trio op.
97 (1811) and missa solemnis op.
123 (1823).
his position at the theater an der wien was terminated when the theatre changed management in early 1804, and he was forced to move temporarily to the suburbs of vienna with his friend stephan von breuning.
this slowed work on leonore, (his original title for his opera), his largest work to date, for a time.
it was delayed again by the austrian censor, and finally premiered, under its present tile of fidelio in november 1805 to houses that were nearly empty because of the french occupation of the city.
in addition to being a financial failure, this version of fidelio was also a critical failure, and beethoven began revising it.
despite this failure, beethoven continued to attract recognition.
in 1807 the musician and publisher muzio clementi secured the rights for publishing his works in england, and haydn's former patron prince esterházy commissioned a mass (the mass in c, op.
86) for his wife's name-day.
but he could not count on such recognition alone.
a colossal benefit concert which he organized in december 1808, and was widely advertised, included the premieres of the fifth and sixth (pastoral) symphonies, the fourth piano concerto, extracts from the mass in c, the scena and aria ah!
perfido op.
65 and the choral fantasy op.
80. there was a large audience, (including czerny and the young ignaz moscheles).
but it was under-rehearsed, involved many stops and starts, and during the fantasia beethoven was noted shouting at the musicians "badly played, wrong, again!"
the financial outcome is unknown.
in the autumn of 1808, after having been rejected for a position at the royal theatre, beethoven had received an offer from napoleon's brother jérôme bonaparte, then king of westphalia, for a well-paid position as kapellmeister at the court in cassel.
to persuade him to stay in vienna, the archduke rudolph, prince kinsky and prince lobkowitz, after receiving representations from the composer's friends, pledged to pay him a pension of 4000 florins a year.
in the event, archduke rudolph paid his share of the pension on the agreed date.
kinsky, immediately called to military duty, did not contribute and died in november 1812 after falling from his horse..  the austrian currency destabilized and lobkowitz went bankrupt in 1811, so that to benefit from the agreement beethoven eventually had recourse to the law, which in 1815 brought him some recompense..
the imminence of war reaching vienna itself was felt in early 1809. in april beethoven had completed writing his piano concerto no.
5 in e flat major, op.
73, which the musicologist alfred einstein has described as “the apotheosis of the military concept” in beethoven’s music.
archduke rudolf left the capital with the imperial family in early may, prompting beethoven’s piano sonata ‘’les adieux’’, (sonata no.
26, op.
81a), actually entitled by beethoven in german “das lebewohl”(“ the farewell”), of which the final movement, ’’das wiedersehen” (‘’the return’’), is dated in the manuscript with the date of rudolf’s homecoming of 30 january 1810.. during the french bombardment of vienna in may beethoven took refuge in the cellar of the house of his brother caspar.
the subsequent occupation of vienna and the disruptions to cultural life and to beethoven’s publishers, together with beethoven’s poor health at the end of 1809, explain his significantly reduced output during this period,  although other notable works of the year include his  string quartet no.
10 in f major, op.
74 (known as ‘’the harp”) and the piano sonata no.
24 in f sharp major op.
78, dedicated to josephine's sister therese brunsvik.
at the end of 1809 beethoven was commissioned to write incidental music for goethe's play egmont.
the result (an overture, and nine additional entractes and vocal pieces, op.
84), which appeared in 1810 fitted well with beethoven's "heroic" style and he became interested in goethe, setting three of his poems as songs (op.
83) and learning about the poet from a mutual acquaintance, bettina brentano (who also wrote to goethe at this time about beethoven).
other works of this period in a similar vein were the f minor string quartet op.
95, to which the composer gave the subtitle quartetto serioso, and the op.
97 piano trio in b flat major known, from its dedication to his patron rudolph as the archduke trio.
in the spring of 1811 beethoven became seriously ill, suffering headaches and high fever.
his doctor johann malfatti recommended him to take a cure at the spa of teplitz (now teplice in czechia) where he wrote two more overtures and sets of incidental music for dramas, this time by august von kotzebue - king stephen op.
117 and the ruins of athens op.
113. advised again to visit teplitz in 1812 he met there with goethe,  who wrote of the composer "his talent amazed me; unfortunately he is an utterly untamed personality, who is not altogether wrong in holding the world to be detestable, but surely does not make it any more enjoyable [...] by his attitude."
beethoven wote to his publishers breitkopf and härtel that "goethe delights far too much in the court atmosphere, far more than is becoming in a poet."
but following their meeting he began a setting for choir and orchestra of  goethe's meeresstille und glückliche fahrt (calm sea and properous voyage) (op.
112), completed in 1815. after this was published in 1822 with a dedication to the poet, beethoven wrote to him "the admiration, the love and esteem which already in my youth i cherished for the one and only immortal goethe have persisted."
while he was at teplitz in 1812 he wrote a ten-page love letter to his "immortal beloved", which he never sent to its addressee.
the identity of the intended recipient was long a subject of debate, although the musicologist maynard solomon has effectively proved that the intended recipient must have been antonie brentano; other candidates have included juliette guicciardi, therese malfatti and josephine brunsvik.
[n 5]
all of these had been regarded by beethoven as possible soulmates during his first decade in vienna.
guicciardi, although she flirted with beethoven, never had any serious interest in him and married wenzel robert von gallenberg in november 1803.
(beethoven insisted to his later secretary and biographer, anton schindler, that gucciardi had "sought me out, crying, but i scorned her.")
josephine had since beethoven's initial infatuation with her married the elderly count joseph deym, who died in 1804. beethoven began to visit her and commenced a passionate correspondence.
initially he accepted that josephine could not love him, but he continue to address himself to her even after she had moved to budapest, finally demonstrating that he had got the message in his last letter to her of 1807: "i thank you for wishing still to appear as if i were not altogether banished from your memory".
malfatti was the niece of beethoven's doctor, and he had proposed to her in 1810. he was 40, she was 19 – the proposal was rejected.
she is now remembered as the recipient of the piano bagatelle für elise.
[n 6]
antonie (toni) brentano (née von birkenstock), ten years younger than the composer, was the wife of franz brentano, the half-brother of bettina brentano, who provided the composer's introduction to the family.
it would seem that antonie and beethoven had an affair during 1811-1812. antonie left vienna with her husband in late 1812 and never met with (or apparently corresponded with) beethoven again, although in her later years she wrote and spoke fondly of him.
in early 1813 beethoven apparently went through a difficult emotional period, and his compositional output dropped.
his personal appearance degraded—it had generally been neat—as did his manners in public, notably when dining.
family issues may have played a part in this.
beethoven had visited his brother johann at the end of october 1812. he wished to end johann's cohabitation with therese obermayer, a woman who already had an illegitimate child.
he was unable to convince johann to end the relationship and appealed to the local civic and religious authorities, but johann and therese married on 8 november.
the illness and eventual death of his brother kaspar from tuberculosis became an increasing concern.
kaspar had been ill for some time; in 1813 beethoven lent him  1500 florins, to procure the repayment of which he was ultimately led to complex legal measures.
after kaspar died on 15 november 1815, beethoven immediately became embroiled in a protracted legal dispute with kaspar's wife johanna over custody of their son karl, then nine years old.
beethoven had successfully applied to kaspar to have himself named sole guardian of the boy.
a late codicil to kaspar's will gave him and johanna joint guardianship.
while beethoven was successful at having his nephew removed from her custody in january 1816, and had him removed to a private school in 1818 he was again preoccupied by the legal processes around karl.
while giving evidence to the court for the nobility, the landrechte, beethoven was unable to prove that he was of noble birth and as a consequence, on 18 december 1818 the case was transferred to the civil magistracy of vienna, where he lost sole guardianship.
[n 7] he only regained custody after intensive legal struggles in 1820. during the years that followed, beethoven  frequently interfered in his nephew's life in what karl perceived as an overbearing manner.
beethoven was finally motivated to begin significant composition again in june 1813, when news arrived of napoleon's defeat at the battle of vitoria by a coalition led by the duke of wellington.
the inventor mälzel persuaded him to write a work commemorating the event for his mechanical instrument the panharmonicon.
this beethoven also transcribed for orchestra as wellington's victory (op.
91,  also known as the battle symphony)[n 8].
it was first performed on 8 december, along with his seventh symphony, op.
92, at a charity concert for victims of the war, a concert whose success led to its repeat on 12th december.
the orchestra included a number of leading and rising musicians who happened to be in vienna at the time, including giacomo meyerbeer and domenico dragonetti.
the work received repeat performances at concerts staged by  beethoven in january and february 1814.
beethoven's renewed popularity led to demands for a revival of fidelio, which, in its third revised version, was also well received at its july opening in vienna, and was frequently staged there during the following years.
beethoven's publishers, artaria, commissioned the 20-year old moscheles to prepare a piano score of the opera, which he inscribed "finished, with god's help!"
- to which beethoven added "o man, help thyself.
"[n 9] that summer beethoven composed a piano sonata for the first time in five years, the (no.
27, opus 90).
he was also one of many composers who produced music in a patriotic vein to entertain the many heads of state and diplomats who came to the congress of vienna that began in november 1814, with the cantata der glorreiche augenblick (the glorious moment) (op.
136) and similar choral works which, in the words of maynard solomon "broadened beethoven's popularity, [but] did little to enhance his reputation as a serious composer."
in april and may 1814, playing in his  ’’archduke’’) trio, beethoven made his last public appearances as a soloist.
the composer louis spohr noted : “the piano was badly out of tune, which beethoven minded little, since he did not hear it […] there was scarcely anything left of the virtuosity of the artist […] i was deeply saddened.”  from 1814 onwards beethoven used for conversation ear-trumpets designed by johann nepomuk maelzel, and a number of these are on display at the beethoven-haus in bonn.
his 1815 compositions include an expressive second setting of the poem "an die hoffnung" (op.
94) in 1815. compared to its first setting in 1805 (a gift for josephine brunsvik), it was "far more dramatic ... the entire spirit is that of an operatic scena."
but his energy seemed to be dropping: apart from these works, he wrote the two cello sonatas op.
101 nos.
1 and 2, and a few minor pieces, and began but abandoned a sixth piano concerto.
between 1815 and 1819 beethoven's output dropped again to a level unique in his mature life.
he attributed part of this to a lengthy illness (he called it an "inflammatory fever") that he had for more than a year, starting in october 1816. it is also doubtless a consequence of the ongoing legal problems concerning his nephew karl.
his biographer maynard solomon further suggests that beethoven found himself increasingly at odds with current musical trends.
unsympathetic to the sorts of trends in german romanticism that featured the supernatural (as in operas by louis spohr, heinrich marschner and carl maria von weber, he also "resisted the impending romantic fragmentation of the [...] cyclic forms of the classical era into small forms and lyric mood pieces" and turned towards study of bach, handel and palestrina.
an old connection was renewed in 1817 when maelzel sought, and obtained, beethoven's endorsement for his newly developed metronome.
during these years the few major works completed include beethoven's only song cycle, an die ferne geliebte op.
98, (1816), and the gigantic hammerklavier sonata (sonata no 29 in b flat major, op.
106) (1818).
it was also in 1818 that he began musical sketches that eventually form part of his final ninth symphony.
by early 1818 beethoven's health had improved, and his nephew karl, now aged 11, moved in with him in january, (although within a year karl's mother had won him back in the courts).
by now the composer's hearing had again significantly deteriorated, necessitating beethoven and his interlocutors writing in notebooks to carry out conversations.
these 'conversation books' are a rich written resource for this period.
they contain discussions about music, business and personal life; they are also a valuable source for his contacts and for investigations into how he intended his music should be performed, and of his opinions of the art of music.
[n 10] his household management had also improved somewhat; nanette streicher, who had assisted in his care during his illness, continued to provide some support, and he finally found a skilled cook.
a testimonial to the esteem in which beethoven was held in england was the presentation to him in this year by thomas broadwood, the proprietor of the company, of a broadwood piano, for which beethoven expressed grateful thanks.
he was not well enough, however, to carry out a visit to london that year which had been proposed by the philharmonic society.
despite his ongoing legal struggles over karl, which involved continuing extensive corresponce and lobbyingtwo events sparked off beethoven's major composition projects in 1819. the first was the announcement of archduke rudolf's promotion to cardinal and archbishop of olomouc, which triggered the missa solemnis op.
123, intended to be ready for his installation in olomouc in march 1820. the other was  the invitation by the publisher antonio diabelli to fifty viennese composers , including beethoven, franz schubert, czerny and the 8-year old franz liszt, to compose a variation each on a theme which he provided.
beethoven was spurred to outdo the competition and by mid-1819 had already completed 20 variations of what were to become the 33 diabelli variations op.
120. neither of these works were to be completed however for a few years.
an interesting musical publication of 1819, however, was archduke rudolf's set of forty piano variations on a theme written for him by beethoven (woo 200), and dedicated to the master.
beethoven's portrait by ferdinand schimon of this year, which was one of the most familiar images of him throughout the next hundred years, was described by schindler as, despite its artistic weaknesses, "in the rendering of that particular look, the majestic forehead [...] the firmly shut mouth and the chin shaped like a shell, [...] truer to nature than any other picture."
beethoven's status was confirmed by the series of concerts sprituels given in vienna by the choirmaster franz xaver gebauer in the 1819/1820 and 1820/1821 seasons, during which all eight of his symphonies to date, plus the oratorio christus and the mass in c, were performed.
beethoven was typically underwhelmed:  when in an april 1820 conversation book a friend mentioned gebauer,  beethoven wrote in reply "geh!
bauer" ("bog off, peasant!")
it was in 1819 that beethoven was first approached by the publisher moritz schlesinger who won the suspicious composer round, whilst visiting him at mödling,  by procuring for him a plate of roast veal.. one consequence of this was that schlesinger was to secure beethoven's three last piano sonatas and his final quartets;  part of the attaction to beethoven was that schlesinger had publishing facilities in germany, france and england which could overcome problems of copyright piracy.
the first of the three sonatas, for which beethoven contracted with schlesinger in 1820 at 30 ducats per sonata, (further delaying completion of the mass), was sent to the publisher at the end of that year (the sonata in e major, op.
109, dedicated to maximiliane, antonie brentano's daughter)..
he was ill again for an extended time in 1821, and completed the missa in 1823, three years after its original due date.
around 1822 his brother johann began to assist him in his business affairs, including him lending him money against ownership of some of his compositions.
two commissions in 1822 had improved beethoven's financial prospects.
the philharmonic society of london offered a commission for a symphony, and prince nikolas golitsin of saint petersburg offered to pay beethoven's price for three string quartets.
the first of these commissions spurred him to finish the ninth symphony, which was first performed, along with the missa solemnis, on 7 may 1824, to great acclaim at the kärntnertortheater.
beethoven stood by the conductor michael umlauf during the premiere beating time (although umlauf had warned the singers and orchestra to ignore him), and because of his deafness was not even aware of the applause which followed until he was turned to witness it.
the allgemeine musikalische zeitung gushed, "inexhaustible genius had shown us a new world", and carl czerny wrote that his symphony "breathes such a fresh, lively, indeed youthful spirit ... so much power, innovation, and beauty as ever [came] from the head of this original man, although he certainly sometimes led the old wigs to shake their heads."
unlike his more lucrative earlier concerts, this did not make him much money, as the expenses of mounting it were significantly higher.
a second concert on 24 may, in which the producer guaranteed him a minimum fee, was poorly attended; nephew karl noted that "many people [had] already gone into the country".
it was beethoven's last public concert.
in 1825, his nine symphonies were performed in a cycle for the first time, by the leipzig gewandhaus orchestra under johann philipp christian schulz.
this was repeated in 1826.
beethoven then turned to writing the string quartets for golitsin, despite failing health.
in april 1825 he was bedridden, and remained ill for about a month.
the illness—or more precisely, his recovery from it—is remembered in the slow movement of the fifteenth quartet, which he called "holy song of thanks ('heiliger dankgesang') to the divinity, from one made well."
he went on to complete the quartets now numbered thirteenth, fourteenth, and sixteenth.
of these  "late quartets", beethoven's favourite was the fourteenth, in c♯ minor, which he rated as his most perfect single work.
the last work completed by beethoven was the substitute final movement of the thirteenth quartet, which replaced the difficult große fuge.
beethoven's nephew karl had attempted suicide on 31 july 1826 by shooting himself in the head.
he survived and was brought to his mother's house, where he recuperated.
he and beethoven were reconciled, but shortly thereafter, in december 1826, illness struck beethoven again, with episodes of vomiting and diarrhoea that nearly ended his life.
karl insisted on joining the army and last saw beethoven in january 1827.
beethoven was bedridden for most of his remaining months, and many friends came to visit.
he died on 26 march 1827 at the age of 56 during a thunderstorm.
his friend anselm hüttenbrenner, who was present at the time, said that there was a peal of thunder at the moment of death.
an autopsy revealed significant liver damage, which may have been due to heavy alcohol consumption.
it also revealed considerable dilation of the auditory and other related nerves.
there is dispute about the cause of his death: alcoholic cirrhosis, syphilis, infectious hepatitis, lead poisoning, sarcoidosis and whipple's disease have all been proposed.
friends and visitors before and after his death clipped locks of his hair, some of which have been preserved and subjected to additional analysis, as have skull fragments removed during the 1862 exhumation.
some of these analyses have led to controversial assertions that he was accidentally poisoned to death by excessive doses of lead-based treatments administered under instruction from his doctor.
beethoven's funeral procession on 29 march 1827 was attended by an estimated 20,000 people.
franz schubert, who died the following year and was buried next to him, was one of the torchbearers.
he was buried in a dedicated grave in the währing cemetery, north-west of vienna, after a requiem mass at the church of the holy trinity (dreifaltigkeitskirche).
his remains were exhumed for study in 1862, and moved in 1888 to vienna's zentralfriedhof.
beethoven is acknowledged to be one of the giants of classical music.
together with bach and johannes brahms, he is referred to as one of the "three bs" who epitomize that tradition.
he was a pivotal figure in the transition from the 18th century musical classicism to 19th century romanticism, and his influence on subsequent generations of composers was profound.
his music features twice on the voyager golden record, a phonograph record containing a broad sample of the images, common sounds, languages, and music of earth, sent into outer space with the two voyager probes.
beethoven composed in several musical genres and for a variety of instrument combinations.
his works for symphony orchestra include nine symphonies (of which the ninth symphony includes a chorus), and about a dozen pieces of "occasional" music.
he wrote seven concerti for one or more soloists and orchestra, as well as four shorter works that include soloists accompanied by orchestra.
his only opera is fidelio; other vocal works with orchestral accompaniment include two masses and a number of shorter works.
his large body of compositions for piano includes 32 piano sonatas and numerous shorter pieces, including arrangements of some of his other works.
works with piano accompaniment include 10 violin sonatas, 5 cello sonatas, and a sonata for french horn, as well as numerous lieder.
he also wrote a significant quantity of chamber music.
in addition to 16 string quartets, he wrote five works for string quintet, seven for piano trio, five for string trio, and more than a dozen works for various combinations of wind instruments.
beethoven's career as a composer is conventionally divided into early, middle, and late periods.
the "early" period is typically seen to last until 1802, the "middle" period from 1802 to 1812, and the "late" period thereafter.
this distinction was first introduced in 1828, just one year after his death, and while often challenged and refined it remains a starting point to understand the development of beethoven's work.
beethoven's early years in bonn arguably represent a further, preliminary, period.
his earliest known composition was from 1782, and a total of 40 pieces by him dating from 1792 or earlier are known today (though mainly from much later sources).
today his best-known works from before 1790 are three piano quartets and three piano sonatas, the quartets being closely modelled on mozart's sonatas for piano and violin.
from 1790 to 1802, his best music can be found in a cantata and a number of concert arias, and in some variations for solo piano, while his instrumental music (including movements of symphonies and a draft violin concerto, as well as various fragmentary chamber works) is conservative and uninspired.
[n 11]
the conventional "first period" begins after beethoven's arrival in vienna in 1792. in the first few years he seems to have composed less than he did at bonn, and his piano trios, op.1 were not published until 1795. from this point onward, he had mastered the 'viennese style' (best known today from haydn and mozart) and was making the style his own.
his works from 1795 to 1800 are larger in scale than was the norm (writing sonatas in four movements, not three, for instance); typically he uses a scherzo rather than a minuet and trio; and his music often includes dramatic, even sometimes over-the-top, uses of extreme dynamics and tempi and chromatic harmony.
it was this that led haydn to believe the third trio of op.1 was too difficult for an audience to appreciate.
he also explored new directions and gradually expanded the scope and ambition of his work.
some important pieces from the early period are the first and second symphonies, the set of six string quartets opus 18, the first two piano concertos, and the first dozen or so piano sonatas, including the famous pathétique sonata, op.
13.
his middle (heroic) period began shortly after the personal crisis brought on by his recognition of encroaching deafness.
it includes large-scale works that express heroism and struggle.
middle-period works include six symphonies (nos.
3–8), the last two piano concertos, the triple concerto and violin concerto, five string quartets (nos.
7–11), several piano sonatas (including the waldstein and appassionata sonatas), the kreutzer violin sonata and his only opera, fidelio.
the "middle period" is sometimes associated with a "heroic" manner of composing, but the use of the term "heroic" has become increasingly controversial in beethoven scholarship.
the term is more frequently used as an alternative name for the middle period.
the appropriateness of the term "heroic" to describe the whole middle period has been questioned as well: while some works, like the third and fifth symphonies, are easy to describe as "heroic", many others, like his symphony no.
6, pastoral, are not.
beethoven's late period began in the decade  1810-1819. he began a renewed study of older music, including works by johann sebastian bach and george frideric handel, that were then being published in the first attempts at complete editions.
the overture the consecration of the house (1822) was an early work to attempt to incorporate these influences.
a new style emerged, now called his "late period".
he returned to the keyboard to compose his first piano sonatas in almost a decade: the works of the late period include the last five piano sonatas and the diabelli variations, the last two sonatas for cello and piano, the late string quartets (see below), and two works for very large forces: the missa solemnis and the ninth symphony.
[citation needed] works from this period are characterised by their intellectual depth, their formal innovations, and their intense, highly personal expression.
the string quartet, op.
131 has seven linked movements, and the ninth symphony adds choral forces to the orchestra in the last movement.
other compositions from this period include the missa solemnis, the last five string quartets (including the massive große fuge) and the last five piano sonatas.
he was attracted to the ideals of the age of enlightenment.
in 1804, when napoleon's imperial ambitions became clear, beethoven took hold of the title page of his third symphony and scratched the name bonaparte out so violently that he made a hole in the paper.
he later changed the work's title to "sinfonia eroica, composta per festeggiare il sovvenire d'un grand'uom" ("heroic symphony, composed to celebrate the memory of a great man"), and he rededicated it to his patron, prince joseph franz von lobkowitz, at whose palace it was first performed.
the beethoven monument in bonn was unveiled in august 1845, in honour of the 75th anniversary of his birth.
it was the first statue of a composer created in germany, and the music festival that accompanied the unveiling was the impetus for the very hasty construction of the original beethovenhalle in bonn (it was designed and built within less than a month, on the urging of franz liszt).
a statue to mozart had been unveiled in salzburg, austria, in 1842. vienna did not honour beethoven with a statue until 1880. his is the only name inscribed on one of the plaques that trim symphony hall, boston; the others were left empty because it was felt that only beethoven's popularity would endure.
there is a museum, the beethoven house, the place of his birth, in central bonn.
the same city has hosted a musical festival, the beethovenfest, since 1845. the festival was initially irregular but has been organised annually since 2007.
the ira f. brilliant center for beethoven studies serves as a museum, research center, and host of lectures and performances devoted solely to this life and works.
the third largest crater on mercury is named in his honour, as is the main-belt asteroid 1815 beethoven.
piazza bra, often shortened to bra, is the largest piazza in verona, italy, with some claims that it is the largest in the country.
the piazza is lined with numerous cafés and restaurants, along with several notable buildings.
the verona arena, an amphitheatre built nearly 2000 years ago, is now a world-famous music venue with regular operatic and contemporary music performances.
verona's town hall, the palazzo barbieri, also looks out across the piazza.
a garden within bra is shaded by cedar and pine trees.
it surrounds the fountain of the alps and a bronze statue of victor emmanuel ii.
this monument to the first king of italy, in which he is sat atop a horse, was inaugurated on 9 january 1883, five years to the day after his death.
there are many significant buildings within and around bra, with construction taking place over many centuries.
the building itself was built in the first century ad on a site then beyond the city walls.
the ludi (shows and games) staged there were so famous that spectators came from many other places, often far away, to witness them.
while it can now host crowds of up to 22,000, the original amphitheatre could seat 30,000 spectators.
the arena has been used by many contemporary performers including pink floyd, rod stewart, elton john, and muse.
it has also hosted numerous operas, including in 1946 ponchielli's la gioconda which saw the debut of maria callas.
palazzo della gran guardia, was the first building erected on the southern edge of bra.
it was originally designed by domenico curtoni as a roof built from the existing wall out to several pillars.
leonardo donato, 90th doge of venice, had requested an area for troops to shelter in poor weather.
work commenced in 1610 but stopped when there was a shortfall in available funds.
nearly 200 years later, in 1808, architect giuseppe barbieri was commissioned to design and complete the project but it was a further 45 years before it was finished.
the building is now used as a venue for conferences, meetings, and exhibitions.
palazzo barbieri is verona's town hall.
originally named palazzo della gran guardia nuova, it was designed by giuseppe barbieri and was later named in his honour.
construction began in 1836 and was completed by 1848.

the statue of liberty replica monument is an outdoor replica of the statue of liberty (liberty enlightening the world), installed on the texas state capitol grounds in austin, texas, united states.
the bronze replica was cast by the friedley-voshardt company and erected by the boy scouts of america in 1951. it stands on a texas limestone base and was originally installed southwest of the capitol, along with a time capsule.
the capsule was buried at the scout camp near bastrop in 2008, and is scheduled to be re-opened in 2076.
the texas pioneer woman monument is an outdoor memorial commemorating the pioneer women of texas, installed on the texas state capitol grounds in austin, texas, united states.
the monument was sculpted by linda sioux henley and erected by the daughters of the republic of texas, district viii, in 1998. it features a bronze statue of a pioneer mother and her baby on a texas sunset red granite pedestal.

miguel de cervantes saavedra, also cerbantes, spanish: [miˈɣel de θeɾˈβantes saaˈβeðɾa]; 29 september 1547 (assumed) – 22 april 1616 ns) was a spanish writer widely regarded as the greatest writer in the spanish language, and one of the world's pre-eminent novelists.
he is best known for don quixote, a classic of western literature, published in two parts between 1605 and 1615, sometimes considered the first modern novel, and the most influential work of fiction ever written.
much of his life was spent in poverty and obscurity, many of its details are disputed or unknown, and the bulk of his surviving work produced in the three years preceding his death.
despite this, his influence and literary contribution is reflected by the fact spanish is often referred to as "the language of cervantes".
in 1569, cervantes was forced to leave spain and moved to rome, where he worked in the household of a cardinal.
in 1570, he enlisted in a spanish navy infantry regiment, and was badly wounded at the battle of lepanto in october 1571. he served as a soldier until 1575, when he was captured by barbary pirates; after five years in captivity, he was ransomed, and returned to madrid.
his first significant novel, titled la galatea, was published in 1585, but he continued to work as a purchasing agent, then later a government tax collector.
part one of don quixote was published in 1605, and its immediate success allowed him to write full time for the first time.
part two of don quixote was published in 1615, other publications include novelas ejemplares, or exemplary novels, viaje del parnaso, or journey to parnassus, and ocho comedias y ocho entremeses.
los trabajos de persiles y sigismunda, or the travails of persiles and sigismunda, was published after his death in 1616.
despite his subsequent fame, much of cervantes' life is uncertain, including his name, background and what he looked like.
although he signed himself cerbantes, his printers used cervantes, which became the common form.
in later life, cervantes used saavedra, the name of a distant relative, rather than the more usual cortinas, after his mother.
another area of dispute are his ethnic origins.
in the 16th century, many spaniards were descended either from moriscos, muslims who remained after the conquest of granada in 1492, or conversos, jews who converted to catholicism after expulsion from spain in 1492. an estimated 20% of the spanish population in the south fell into one of these categories, and it has been suggested cervantes' mother may have been one of these new christians.
however, others refute this theory.
no confirmed portrait of the author is known to exist.
the one most often associated with cervantes is attributed to juan de jáuregui, but both names were added at a later date.
the el greco painting in the museo del prado, known as retrato de un caballero desconocido, or portrait of an unknown gentleman, is cited as 'possibly' depicting cervantes, but there is no evidence for this.
the portrait by luis de madrazo, at the biblioteca nacional de españa, was painted in 1859, based on his imagination.
the image that appears on spanish euro coins of €0.10, €0.20, and €0.50 is based on a bust, created in 1905.
it is generally accepted miguel de cervantes saavedra was born around 29 september 1547, in alcalá de henares.
he was the second son of barber-surgeon rodrigo de cervantes and his wife, leonor de cortinas (ca 1520–1593).
rodrigo came from córdoba, andalusia, where his father juan de cervantes was an influential lawyer.
rodrigo was frequently in debt, or searching for work, and moved constantly.
leonor came from arganda del rey, and died in october 1593, at the age of 73; surviving legal documents indicate she had seven children, could read and write, and was a resourceful individual with an eye for business.
when rodrigo was imprisoned for debt from october 1553 to april 1554, she supported the family on her own.
cervantes' siblings were andrés (born 1543), andrea (born 1544), luisa (born 1546), rodrigo (born 1550), magdalena (born 1554) and juan.
they lived in córdoba until 1556, when his grandfather died; for reasons that are unclear, rodrigo did not benefit from his will, and the family disappears until 1564, when he filed a lawsuit in seville.
seville was then in the midst of an economic boom, and rodrigo managed rented accommodation for his elder brother andres, who was a junior magistrate.
it is assumed cervantes attended the jesuit college in seville, where one of the teachers was jesuit playwright pedro pablo acevedo, who moved there in 1561 from córdoba.
however, legal records show his father got into debt once more, and in 1566, the family moved to madrid.
in the 19th century, a biographer discovered an arrest warrant for a miguel de cervantes, dated 15 september 1569, who was charged with wounding antonio de sigura in a duel.
although disputed at the time, largely on the grounds such behaviour was unworthy of so great an author, it is now accepted as the most likely reason for cervantes leaving madrid.
he eventually made his way to rome, where he found a position in the household of giulio acquaviva, an italian bishop who spent 1568 to 1569 in madrid, and was appointed cardinal in 1570. when the 1570 to 1573 ottoman–venetian war began, spain formed part of the holy league, a coalition formed to support the venetian republic.
possibly seeing an opportunity to have his arrest warrant rescinded, cervantes went to naples, then part of the crown of aragon.
the military commander in naples was alvaro de sande, a friend of the family, who gave cervantes a commission under the marquis de santa cruz.
at some point, he was joined in naples by his younger brother rodrigo.
in september 1571, cervantes sailed on board the marquesa, part of the holy league fleet under don john of austria, illegitimate half brother of phillip ii of spain; on 7 october, they defeated the ottoman fleet at the battle of lepanto.
according to his own account, although suffering from malaria, cervantes was given command of a 12-man skiff, small boats used for assaulting enemy galleys.
the marquesa lost 40 dead, and 120 wounded, including cervantes, who received three separate wounds, two in the chest, and another that rendered his left arm useless.
his actions at lepanto were a source of pride to the end of his life,[b] while don john approved no less than four separate pay increases for him.
in journey to parnassus, published two years before his death in 1616, cervantes claimed to have "lost the movement of the left hand for the glory of the right".
as with much else, the extent of his disability is unclear, the only source being cervantes himself, while commentators cite his habitual tendency to praise himself.
[c]  however, they were serious enough to earn him six months in hospital at messina, sicily.
although he returned to service in july 1572, records show his chest wounds were still not completely healed in february 1573. based mainly in naples, he joined expeditions to corfu and navarino, and took part in the 1573 occupation of tunis and la goulette, which were recaptured by the ottomans in 1574. despite lepanto, the war overall was an ottoman victory, and the loss of tunis a military disaster for spain.
cervantes returned to palermo, where he was paid off by the duke of sessa, who gave him letters of commendation.
in early september 1575, cervantes and rodrigo left naples on the galley sol; as they approached barcelona on 26 september, their ship was captured by ottoman pirates, and the brothers taken to algiers.
rodrigo was ransomed in 1577, but his family could not afford the fee for cervantes, who was forced to remain.
turkish historian rasih nuri i̇leri found evidence suggesting cervantes worked on the construction of the kılıç ali pasha complex, which means he spent at least part of his captivity in istanbul.
by 1580, spain was occupied integrating portugal, and suppressing the dutch revolt, while the ottomans were at war with persia; the two sides agreed a truce, leading to an improvement of relations.
after almost five years, and four escape attempts, in 1580 cervantes was set free by the trinitarians, a religious charity that specialised in ransoming christian captives, and returned to madrid.
while in captivity, both don john and the duke of sessa died, depriving cervantes of two potential patrons, while the spanish economy was in dire straits.
this made finding employment difficult; other than a period in 1581 to 1582, when he was employed as an intelligence agent in north africa, little is known of his movements prior to 1584.
in april of that year, cervantes visited esquivias, to help arrange the affairs of his recently deceased friend and minor poet, pedro lainez.
here he met catalina de salazar y palacios (ca 1560?–1626), eldest daughter of the widowed catalina de palacios; her husband died leaving only debts, but the elder catalina owned some land of her own.
this may be why in december 1584, cervantes married her daughter, then between 15 and 18 years old.
the first use of the name cervantes saavedra appears in 1586, on documents related to his marriage.
shortly before this, his illegitimate daughter isabel was born in november.
her mother, ana franca, was the wife of a madrid inn keeper; they apparently concealed it from her husband, but cervantes acknowledged paternity.
when ana franca died in 1598, he asked his sister magdalena to take care of her.
in 1587, cervantes was appointed as a government purchasing agent, then became a tax collector in 1592. such positions were unpaid, and assumed the holder lived on what they kept, which meant a degree of 'corruption' was expected.
they were also subject to price fluctuations, which could go either way; he was briefly jailed several times for 'irregularities', but quickly released.
several applications for positions in spanish america were rejected, although modern critics note images of the colonies appear in his work.
from 1596 to 1600, he lived primarily in seville, then returned to madrid in 1606, where he remained for the rest of his life.
in later years, he received some financial support from the count of lemos, although he was excluded from the retinue lemos took to naples when appointed viceroy in 1608. in july 1613, he joined the third order franciscan, then a common way for catholics to gain spiritual merit.
it is generally accepted cervantes died on 16 april 1616; the symptoms described, including intense thirst, correspond to diabetes, then untreatable.
in accordance with his will, cervantes was buried in the convent of the barefoot trinitarians, in central madrid.
his remains went missing when moved during rebuilding work at the convent in 1673, and in 2014, historian fernando de prado launched a project to rediscover them.
in january 2015, francisco etxeberria, the forensic anthropologist leading the search, reported the discovery of caskets containing bone fragments, and part of a board, with the letters 'm.c.'.
based on evidence of injuries suffered at lepanto, on 17 march 2015, they were confirmed as belonging to cervantes, along with his wife and others.
they were formally reburied at a public ceremony in june 2015.
cervantes claims to have written over 20 plays, of which only two survive, el trato de argel, based on his experiences in captivity, and el cerco de numancia.
such works were extremely short-lived, and even lope de vega, the best-known playwright of the day, could not live on their proceeds.
in 1585, he published la galatea, a conventional pastoral romance that received little contemporary notice; despite promising to write a sequel, he never did so.
aside from these, and some poems, by 1605, cervantes had not been published for 20 years.
in don quixote, he challenged a form of literature that had been a favourite for more than a century, explicitly stating his purpose was to undermine 'vain and empty' chivalric romances.
his portrayal of real life, and use of everyday speech in a literary context was considered innovative, and proved instantly popular.
first published in january 1605, don quixote and sancho panza featured in masquerades held to celebrate the birth of philip iv on 8 april.
he finally achieved a degree of financial security, while its popularity led to demands for a sequel.
in the foreword to his 1613 work, novelas ejemplares, dedicated to his patron, the count of lemos, cervantes promises to produce one, but was pre-empted by an unauthorised version published in 1614, published under the name alonso fernández de avellaneda.
it is possible this delay was deliberate, to ensure support from his publisher and reading public; cervantes finally produced the second part of don quixote in 1615.
the two parts of don quixote are different in focus, but similar in their clarity of prose, and realism; the first was more comic, and had greater popular appeal.
the second part is often considered more sophisticated and complex, with a greater depth of characterisation and philosophical insight.
in addition to this, he produced a series of works between 1613 and his death in 1616. they include a collection of tales titled exemplary novels, similar in style to picaresque novels written by lazarillo de tormes.
this was followed by viaje del parnaso, or eight comedies and eight new interludes, and los trabajos de persiles y sigismunda, completed just before his death, and published posthumously in january 1617.
he was rediscovered by english writers in the mid-18th century; literary editor john bowle argued cervantes was as significant as any of the greek and roman authors then popular, and published an annotated edition in 1781. now viewed as a significant work, at the time it proved a failure.
however, don quixote has been translated into all major languages, in 700 editions.
mexican author carlos fuentes suggested cervantes and his contemporary william shakespeare form part of a narrative tradition, which includes homer, dante, defoe, dickens, balzac, and joyce.
sigmund freud claimed he learnt spanish to read cervantes in the original; he particularly admired el coloquio de los perros, or dialogue of the dogs, from exemplary tales.
two dogs, cipión and berganza, share their stories; as one talks, the other listens, occasionally making comments.
from 1871 to 1881, he and his close friend, eduard silberstein, wrote letters to each other, using cipión and berganza.
the tricentennial of don quixote's publication in 1905 was marked with celebrations in spain; the 400th anniversary of his death in 2016, saw the production of cervantina, a celebration of his plays by the compañía nacional de teatro clásico in madrid.
the biblioteca virtual miguel de cervantes, the largest digital archive of spanish-language historical and literary works in the world, is named after the author.

generally considered a mediocre poet, few survive; some appear in la galatea, while he also wrote dos canciones à la armada invencible.
his sonnets are considered his best work, particularly al túmulo del rey felipe en sevilla, canto de calíope and epístola a mateo vázquez.
viaje del parnaso, or journey to parnassus, is his most ambitious verse work, an allegory that consists largely of reviews of contemporary poets.
he published 16 dramatic works including eight full-length plays (spanish links to plays included), only two of which survive;
he also wrote 8 short farces (entremeses):
these plays and entremeses made up ocho comedias y ocho entreméses nuevos, nunca representados (eight comedies and eight new interludes, never before performed), which appeared in 1615.
[citation needed] the dates and order of composition of cervantes' entremeses are unknown.
[citation needed] faithful to the spirit of lope de rueda, cervantes endowed them with novelistic elements, such as simplified plot, the type of descriptions normally associated with a novel, and character development.
cervantes included some of his dramas among the works he was most satisfied with.
[citation needed]
don quixote is the subject of a multitude of works in other fields of art, including ballet, films, television, music and opera.
the texas world war ii memorial is an outdoor monument commemorating the more than 20,000 texans who died in service during world war ii, installed on the texas state capitol grounds in austin, texas, united states.
the memorial, a replica of the state's pillar at the national world war ii memorial in washington, d.c., was by designed by an unknown artist and erected by the texas world war ii memorial committee and texas state preservation board in 2007. it features a 17-foot (5.2 m) granite column with a bronze oak and wheat wreath.
the bentonville confederate monument is installed in bentonville, arkansas, united states.
placed in the center of square park, the 20 feet (6.1 m) granite statue of a confederate soldier standing at parade rest was placed by the united daughters of the confederacy in 1908. a later plaque honors james henderson berry, a confederate soldier with the 16th arkansas infantry regiment who would later become the first arkansas governor from benton county.
the inscription reads "they fought for home and fatherland.
their names are borne on honors shield.
their record is with god.
".
the statue was manufactured in bare, vermont.
although the park was deeded to the united daughters of the confederacy for use as a park in perpetuity, the  chapter had disbanded prior to 1996. benton county took control of the park, and allowed the city of bentonville to take over care and maintenance.
the monument was added to the national register of historic places (nrhp) in 1996.

ashaar baghdad (english: baghdad's poetry) is a public monument in baghdad, created by the sculptor, mohammed ghani hikmat (1929-2011) and inaugurated in 2013. it appears as a golden globe, bearing arabic letters that have been squeezed together and distorted to form the spherical shape.
it is an unusual example of hurufiyya-inspired sculpture.
in 2010, the mayor of baghdad commissioned the sculptor, mohammed ghani hikmat, to complete a series of four monuments as part of a baghdad culture program.
the artist began work on four new sculptures to be erected in various locations around baghdad.
however, this would be his final project, for the sculptor died before it was completed.
ghani's son oversaw the completion of the project.
all four works blended iraqi tradition with modern techniques and materials.
the first to be completed was al fanous el sehri (magic lantern) inaugurated in 2011. the remaining three works, ashaar baghdad (baghdad's poetry), a fountain fearuting arabic script; timthal baghdad, (baghdad's statue) a column featuring the city as a beautiful girl, wearing traditional abassid costume.
and  enkath el iraq (saving iraq's culture), a sumerian cylindrical seal in the hands of an iraqi citizen; were all inaugurated in 2013.
mohammed ghani hikmat was known for his public works, now on display throughout baghdad's urban spaces, and also for smaller statues carved in wood, depicting the everyday life of baghdad's people.
his most well-known works include a pair of statues of queen scheherazade and king shahryar, located on the banks of the tigris river, near abu nuwas street and the fountain of kahramana in baghdad's central business district.
the choice of location for his works, was important to ghani, who wanted the sculptures to be accessible to all.
he avoided public squares and gardens, but instead wanted his works to be situated in the streets and on the side of buildings.
ashaar baghdad, (baghdad’s poetry) is a fountain of 5 metres in height situated in al dallal square, al karakh neighbourhood, baghdad,  near the beiruti café and was inaugurated in 2013
the structure has a spherical shape and features arabic script that has been squeezed and distorted to form the golden orb.
the sphere floats in the middle of a water fountain near the beiruti cafe near karkh, which is the northern tip of baghdad.
the script is taken from a poem, baghdad, the most powerful of you, that glorifies the city, written by the post-war iraqi poet, mustafa jamal al din (b.
1927), which ghani had found written on the poet's tombstone.
the script reads:
"baghdad no matter what happens to you, you will flower again."
the monument is an important example of hurufiyya-inspired sculpture.
although, hurufiyya is most often associated with painting and book art, it also included ceramicists and sculptors.
unlike many other public monuments in baghdad, ashaar baghdad survived the looting and vandalism that occurred following the us-led invasion of 2003.
kahramana is a fountain located in baghdad's sa'adoon street depicting a scene from the legend of ali baba and the forty thieves; a story taken from one thousand and one nights in which the slave girl marjana outwitted the thieves by tricking them into hiding inside jars over which she poured hot oil.
the statue was officially opened in 1971 and was the work of the iraqi sculptor, mohammed ghani hikmat.
it has become one of baghdad's most iconic public artworks.
in the aftermath of the us-led invasion of 2003, the work assumed new meanings for the iraqi people.
from 1969 when iraq became a republic and the  hashemite monarchy was overthrown, leading artists and sculptors were commissioned to produce artworks that would beautify the city of baghdad, glorify iraq's ancient past and contribute to a sense of national identity.
during this period, sculptors including khaled al-rahal, jawad saleem and mohammed ghani hikmat executed a number of high profile public monuments which are now dotted around the city of baghdad.
mohammed ghani hikmat, who was commissioned to construct kahramana, was a well-known iraqi sculptor, whose public works were on display throughout baghdad's streetscapes and urban spaces.
his works achieved popularity because they depicted scenes from the everyday life of baghdad's people and also drew on iraqi folklore.
many of ghani's early sculptures were inspired by iraqi folklore, especially characters from  one thousand and one nights (widely known as the tales of arabian nights).
his early works were figurative and included statues of sinbad, the sailor; the 10th-century poet, al-mutanabbi; the first abassid caliph, abu-ja'afar mansur (in stone); hammurabi (in bronze) and gilgamesh.
as ghani matured, his work became increasingly  abstract, but he never lost sight of the need to reference iraq's ancient art traditions through the use of arabic script, geometric designs, and sumerian architectural features.
his most well-known works include a pair of statues of queen scheherazade and king shahryar, located on the banks of the tigris river, near abu nuwas street and the fountain of kahramana in the central business district.
built in the late 1960s and inaugurated in 1971, the fountain was inspired by the story of ali baba and the forty thieves from one thousand and one nights and the slave girl, marjana (or morgiana), who outwitted the thieves.
the story relates how the slave girl persuaded thieves, who had come to attack her master, to hide in storage jars.
she then pours boiling oil into the jars to kill the thieves.
as a mark of his gratitude, ali baba grants marjana her freedom and she ultimately marries ali baba's son.
the fountain depicts the slave girl standing over 40 jars, ready to pour the hot oil.
it was cast in bronze, stands 3.3 metres in height and is situated in kahramana square, sa'adoon street, baghdad.
as the girl pours the water, a series of lilting fountains cascades downward towards the base of the statue.
the cascading water contributed to the monument's grandeur, but the water was turned off during the iran-iraq war and the fountain fell into a state of disrepair, with overgrown verges and the base of the fountain filled with litter.
its storage jars were painted green, a colour that drew the disapproval of the sculptor.
following the us-led invasion of 2003, some of hikmat's work took on new meanings and new political interpretations emerged from iraq's destruction.
at the time, the iraqis saw that the work represented the  new reality of their country and the number '40' became charged with meaning.
the provisional governing council, after the occupation, included forty people, which came to symbolise the forty thieves; and the decisions of the iraqi civil administrator, paul bremer, consisted of 53 resolutions, with resolution no.
40 referring to the dissolution of the iraqi army.
this resolution, which left some 400,000 iraqi soldiers without employment, led to public protests and the kahramana fountain became a popular starting point for public demonstrations and civil rights campaigners.
in 2015, the 70th anniversary of the united nations, the fountain kahramana was chosen for the world national heritage.
timthal baghdad (baghdad's statue) is a public monument in baghdad, created by the sculptor, mohammed ghani hikmat (1929-2011) and inaugurated in 2013. it is a tall column with a woman dressed in abassid costume sitting on the top.
the column is inscribed with arabic letters, taken from a famous arabic poem by eminent poet, mustafa jamal al-din.
the statue is intended to glorify both the city and its ancient heritage.
in 2010, the mayor of baghdad commissioned the sculptor, mohammed ghani hikmat, to complete a series of four monuments as part of a baghdad culture program.

the first of the three sculptures inaugurated in 2013 was timthal baghdad (baghdad’s statue, pictured).
it is a column featuring a lady sitting on a chair wearing abbassid traditional clothes and is located in andalusia square (al andalus).
the overall height of the column is 13.5 metres (10.5 metre base and 3 metres for the figure), making it one of the tallest monuments in the city centre..
the column features poetry by the great poet, mustafa jamal al-din, which glorify the city of baghdad.
the verse reads in part:
baghdad, what did you do?
only let your green window shine
you passed the world and your morning is sunny
and i will judge you, and your night will be moonlit
the figure of the abassid woman is reclining, with her back to the sun, so that she is looking towards the horizon in front of her.
the woman is intended to signify that the country's ancestors were from the east.

the columbus police memorial is a memorial in columbus, ohio's genoa park, united states.
it has inscriptions of the names of police officers killed while serving, and serves as a gathering site for memorial services.
its dedication ceremony was held on 26 may 2000.
the original drawings for the design was made by thomas raymond hayes, a civilian police artist who became paralyzed during his service as a police officer in 1979 when he sustained a gunshot wound in the back while arresting two drugged teenagers.
his name was also etched into the memorial after his death at the age of 61 on 20 january 2011, which was ruled a homicide by the franklin county coroner in march 2011.
the monument is approximately 15 feet (4.6 m) wide and 10 feet (3.0 m) tall, made out of barre grey granite with polished black standard inserts.
atop the center of its base stands a tapering pillar crowned by a bronze columbus division of police badge with a black mourning band.
a plaque beneath the badge reads as follows:
served faithfullysacrificed valiantlyremembered eternallydedicated to the memory of ourfellow columbus police officersthis 26th day of may 2000
three back-to-back rectangular slabs, bricked up in the base and inscribed with white lettering, list the names of police officers who have died in the line of duty.
the name of columbus swat officer steven m. smith is currently the last (56th) among them after being engraved on 11 may 2016; he was shot in clintonville on 10 april of that year and succumbed to his injuries three days later.
the monument to ignacio zaragoza is installed in puebla, in the mexican state of puebla.
the zócalo is a park and plaza in the historic center of puebla, a city in the mexican state of puebla.
the zócalo, or main square, remains the cultural, political and religious center of the city.
it was the first block to be laid out, with the rest of the historic center traced out from it in the form of a checkerboard.
this main plaza originally was rectangular, but later made square because the earlier version was considered to be ugly.
until the end of the 18th century, this was the main market for the town.
for much of the colonial period, it was the main source of potable water via a fountain that had been installed in the center in the mid-16th century.
many political and cultural events have been and continue to be held here.
bullfights were held in the main square from 1566 to 1722.
today, the zocalo is a tree-filled plaza and contains a large number of sculptures, but the most noted is the san miguel arcángel fountain, placed in the center in 1777. many notable buildings surround the zocalo including city hall, the casa de los muñecos and the cathedral.
most of the streets in puebla are named on a numbering system, which centers on the northwest corner of the zocalo.
there are four statues of muses installed at each corner of the plaza.
jan hendrix's sculpture, kiosko, is installed in the plaza, along with the monumento al sitio de puebla and puebla de los ángeles.
the monument to grace darling, in the churchyard of st aidan's church, bamburgh, northumberland is a victorian gothic memorial.
the monument was designed by anthony salvin, with later renovations by frederick wilson, c. r. smith and w. s. hicks.
grace darling was born on 24 november 1815, the daughter of the lighthouseman at longstone lighthouse.
in 1838, darling became a national heroine when she and her father rescued nine people from the wreck of the ss forfarshire, a ship that had run aground off big harcar, an island off the northumbrian coast.
darling died, aged 26, in 1842 and the monument was raised over her grave in the same year.
it is a grade ii* listed structure.
grace darling's rescue, with her father, of nine survivors from the ss forfarshire made her a national heroine.
darling received the gold medal for bravery from the royal humane society, the silver medal for gallantry from the precursor of the royal national lifeboat institution, and a tribute fund included a contribution of £50 from queen victoria.
her death from tuberculosis four years later was an occasion of national mourning.
buried in the churchyard of st aidan's, her grave was embellished by a large funerary monument designed by anthony salvin.
salvin's choice of portland stone for the memorial was unfortunate, it weathered badly and by 1885 complete reconstruction was required.
the original effigy of darling was moved into the church and a replacement, carved from stone donated by william armstrong, 1st baron armstrong of bamburgh castle, was designed by c. r. smith.
further damage was caused by a storm in 1895, and the canopy was replaced to a design by w. s. hicks.
in 2013, the 175th anniversary of the rescue was commemorated with a service.
sir nickolaus pevsner and ian richmond, in the northumbrian edition of the buildings of england describe the monument as a "gothic shrine".
the style is decorated gothic.
the recumbent effigy of darling lies under a three-arched canopy with "metal colonettes" and topped by finials.
the monument was given a grade ii* listing designation in 1969.

enclave: the ottawa women's monument is a public monument that honours the lives of local women and girls murdered by men between 1990 and 2000. it is located in minto park, off of elgin street, in ottawa, ontario, canada.
it was built in 1992 by the women's urgent action committee in reaction to the montreal massacre of december 6, 1989, and a patriarchal climate of violence against women.
upon the brutal murder of pamella behrendt by her husband, the women's urgent action committee was created.
they decided to use minto park as a spot for her vigil in summer 1990. unveiled december 6, 1992, on the national day of remembrance and action on violence against women, enclave was created by artist c. j. fleury and landscape architect mary leigh faught, led by the committee.
the group continues to hold vigils for ottawa women at the memorial, and there are annual gatherings on december 6, the anniversary of the école polytechnique massacre.
the committee also planted trees in memorial of murdered and abused women and girls.
the last engraving was made in 2000, when the name of sandra campbell was replaced with "jane doe" due to legal issues, causing controversy and contributing to the dissolution of the committee.
since then, no official changes have been made to the monument though many people wish to have more names added.
[citation needed]
the central piece of the monument is a 2-metre-long (6.6 ft) uncut upright granite stone.
on its rough surface is a smooth indented double-pointed oval, or yoni, containing engravings.
the main engraving consists of the same text in english and french.
in english it reads:
to honour and to grieveall womenabused and murdered by menenvision a world without violencewhere women arerespected&free.
illustrations of a three-swirl symbol (or triskele), the phases of the moon, waves, and female figures also appear on the stone's face.
surrounding this central stone are 37 smaller stones, placed in an open spiral, each engraved with the name of a woman killed by an act of violence perpetrated by a man.
the ottawa women's monument is located in the middle of minto park, in line with the bust of argentinian general josé de san martín, which is situated on the elgin street side of the park.

enclave: the ottawa women's monument is an instalment that incorporates feminine symbolic imagery.
the boulder was chosen to call to mind the visual of hips without having to cut or modify in stone to make it look a particular way.
this was important in its design so as to be easily identifiable as naturally female and not sculpted to fit certain ideas of femininity.
the triskele spiral engraved at the top is a neolithic symbol that signifies continuity and references ancient divine femininity.
the round arrangement of the stones is meant to evoke a sense of cyclical life, death and rebirth, openness, and to encourage people to enter the walls of the enclave and engage with the memories of the women mourned there.
the shape of the boulder and the polished pointed oval also reflects yonic imagery.
additionally, the memorial's geographical location between ottawa's courthouse and the police station can act to remind visitors of the systemic issues at play in violence against women and the lack of attention given to addressing them.
the women and girls memorialized are:
in 2000, legal issues surrounding the accusation of one of the women's alleged murderers took place.
this resulted in the committee being required to remove the name of sandra campbell because her husband's murder charges were stayed.
instead of removing the stone, they replaced her name with "jane doe" to reflect the countless women who have disappeared, and the people responsible who have not been brought to justice by the legal system.
another controversy surrounding the monument is the claim that it is sexist in its targeting of men as perpetrators.
some feminists and members of the committee were also concerned with its specifying men as agents of violence against women because they thought it could direct attention away from the victims.
the essentialized female imagery is also a subject of debate as it is seen by some as exclusionary in its portrayal of a particular kind of womanhood and its erasure of the specific struggles with gendered violence faced by indigenous women and girls.
the tri-states monument (also known as tri-state rock) is a granite monument that marks the tripoint of the state boundaries of new jersey, new york, and pennsylvania.
it is at the northwestern end of the boundary between new jersey and new york, the northern end of the boundary between new jersey and pennsylvania, and the eastern end of the boundary between new york and pennsylvania.
the monument is located at the confluence of the delaware and neversink rivers.
this location is also known as carpenter's point.
the nearby witness monument, also known as the reference monument or the western state line monument, is a taller upright granite monument located south of the laurel grove cemetery in port jervis, new york, and under a bridge for interstate 84. it is not directly on any state boundary, but instead witnesses the location of two points: this tripoint and the corner boundary point between new york and pennsylvania in the delaware river.
the supreme court of the united states summarized the boundaries of these three states with respect to this monument in new jersey v. new york, 283 u.s. 336 (1931):
... where it (the delaware) forms a boundary between new york and pennsylvania.
the delaware continues its course as such boundary to tristate rock, near port jervis in new york, at which point pennsylvania and new york are met by new jersey.
from there the river marks the boundary between pennsylvania and new jersey until pennsylvania stops at the delaware state line, and from then on the river divides delaware from new jersey until it reaches the atlantic between cape henlopen and cape may.
also, it is the northernmost point of new jersey, in montague township, sussex county.
in 1664, king charles ii of england granted his brother, james, the duke of york, a royal colony that covered what had been new netherlands.
later in 1664, the duke of york divided this area between the hudson river and the delaware river to sir george carteret and lord berkeley of stratton.
the western and northern border was to be:
along said river or bay (the delaware) to the northward as far as the northward most branch of the said bay or river, which is in latitude 41 degrees, 40 minutes and crosseth over thence in a straight line to the latitude 41 degrees on hudson's river: which said tract of land is hereafter to be called by the name of new caeserea or new jersey.
in december 1872, the new jersey geological survey had the state geologist, george h. cook, survey the boundary between new jersey and new york.
in 1874, the u.s. coast and geodetic survey recovered the previous crow foot cut marking the station location and placed a lead-filled copper pipe in a deep hole drilled into the bedrock.
in 1882, this copper bolt was replaced with a granite monument similar to the witness monument.
but ice flows broke off the upper portion by the spring of 1883. the remaining monument was then reworked on may 21, 1885 to its current description.
the tri-states monument is 2 feet 4 inches (71 cm) long, 1 foot 4 inches (41 cm) wide, and 1 foot 5 inches (43 cm) high above the bedrock.
the top surface is engraved with the initials of the names of the three states and with grooves representing the state boundaries.
"tri states monument" is engraved on the north side.
it is by the water's edge near the high-water mark of the rivers.
a bronze u.s. national geodetic survey survey marker stamped laurel no.
2 1942 was in the center of the top surface until 2013. it was a reference mark for the triangulation station, laurel, that was 25 feet (7.6 m) from the witness monument.
both were set in 1942.
the witness monument is inscribed "boundary monument" and dated 1882 on both sides.
"witness monument" is engraved on the east side.
the new jersey (south) side details the location of the tripoint:
south 64 degrees w. 72 1/4 feet from this is the tri state rock which is the northwest end of the new york & new jersey boundary & the north end of the new jersey & pennsylvania boundary.
it also lists the commissioners from new jersey: abraham browning, thomas n. mccarter, and george h. cook; and surveyor edward a. bowser.
the new york (north) side details the location of the corner boundary point between new york and pennsylvania:
the corner between new york & pennsylvania is in the centre of the delaware river 475 feet due west of the tri state rock.
and lists the commissioners from new york: henry r. pierson, chauncey m. depew, elias w. leavenworth; and surveyor h. w. clarke.

the minoan fountain was a monumental public fountain hewn directly from the natural rock.
it is located directly behind the stoa of antigonos outside the temenos of the sanctuary of apollo on the island of delos.

a monumental façade on the south side gave access to the fountain through a portico lined with small doric columns.
nine steps led down to the level of the water.
a thin doric column stood on the third lowest step to further support the roof.
the column remains standing, and the spring still fills with water.
when repairs were conducted in the mid-2nd century bc, the fountainhouse was decorated with a fresco of a river god with three nymphs.
the inscription dedicated the spring to the minion nymphs.
an inscribed stele dating to the 5th century regulated use of the public fountain with "no washing, swimming, or throwing of dung into the sacred spring".
transgressors faced a monetary fine.

the krishnapura chhatri, also known as the krishna pura chhatri are three chhatri located in indore, madhya pradesh, india.
the structures were built by the holkars as cenotaphs to house the remains of the dynasty's rulers, leading to them also being known as the holkar chhatris.
all three of the chhatris are located half a kilometer from the palace-city of rajwada, which was also built by the holkar dynasty.
the powerful family that built the chhatris, the holkars, were originally a minor clan within the maratha empire.
they belonged to the dhangar caste, which originated in maharashtra.
while in maratha service, the holkars fought against the mughal empire and the british east india company.
however, following the third anglo-maratha war and the subsequent collapse of the maratha empire in 1818, the holkars agreed to establish a protectorate on behalf of the east india company in indore.
this diplomatic move established the holkar dynasty, which ruled indore until indian independence in 1948.
the krishnapura chhatri themselves were built in the mid 19th century to honor the deceased members of the holkar dynasty.
they are named for krishna bai holkar, the wife of famed military leader yashwantrao holkar and the mother of malhar rao holkar ii.
the structures are built over the spot where the rulers of indore were cremated.
the complex contains three chhatris and five cenotaphs.
steps from the back of the site lead to the bank of the nearby kahn river.
the chhatris are made of several different types of stone, and feature elaborately carved exteriors and columns.
the site around half a kilometer from rajwada palace.
due to the site's location within the city of indore, parts of the complex have previously fallen into disrepair.
as of 2018 efforts were being conducted to clean up the area.
in 2018 the madhya pradesh tourism board announced that it would include the chhatris on a walking tour of the historic sites of indore.

several memorials have been devoted to theodore roosevelt, the 26th president of the united states.
additionally, various groups have acted to preserve his legacy.
in 1919, the theodore roosevelt association (originally known as the permanent memorial national committee) was founded by friends and supporters of roosevelt.
soon renamed the roosevelt memorial association (rma), it was chartered in 1920 under title 36 of the united states code.
in parallel with the rma was an organization for women, the women's theodore roosevelt association, that had been founded in 1919 by an act of the new york state assembly.
both organizations merged in 1956 under the current name.

our lady of peace, mother of peace, queen of peace or our lady queen of peace is a title of the blessed virgin mary in the roman catholic church.
she is represented in art holding a dove and an olive branch, symbols of peace.
her official memorial in the general roman calendar is on july 9 in the universal church except for hawaii and some churches in the united states, where it is kept on january 24.
the traditional story holds that in the early 1500s in france, a certain jean de joyeuse presented the statue as a wedding gift to his young bride, françoise e voisins.
the statue was known as the "virgin of joyeuse", and became a cherished family heirloom.
around the year 1588, jean's grandson, henri joyeuse, joined the capuchin franciscans in paris and brought the statue with him, where it remained for the next 200 years.
with the olive branch in her hand and the prince of peace on her arm, the statue was called notre dame de paix (our lady of peace).
in 1657 the capuchin community erected a larger chapel to accommodate the growing number of faithful who sought her intercession.
on july 9 that year, before a large crowd which included king louis xiv, the papal nuncio to france blessed and solemnly enthroned the virgin's statue.
pope alexander vii would later designate this date for the capuchin community to celebrate the feast of our lady of peace.
during the french revolution, which erupted in 1789, the capuchins were driven from their monastery.
they took the image with them to prevent its destruction by the ransacking rebels.
when peace was restored in the land, the statue was brought out of hiding and entrusted to peter coudrin, a priest in paris.
in 1800, coudrin and henriette aymer de chevalerie became co-founders of a community of sisters, brothers and priests — the congregation of the sacred hearts of jesus and mary and the perpetual adoration of the blessed sacrament.
coudrin gave the statue to mother aymer, who enshrined it in a convent chapel in the picpus district of paris on may 6, 1806.  the members were also known more simply as the picpus fathers or sacred hearts religious.
excluding its pedestal, the figure of dark hardwood is 11 inches tall, and is fashioned in the renaissance style of the period.
mary is depicted as a dignified matron, with the christ child on her left arm and an olive branch in her right hand.
tradition holds that in 1682 some merchants found an abandoned box on the shore of salvador's mar del sur.
unable to open it, they tied the box on a donkey's back and set out to inform the local authorities of their find.
when they were passing the parish church, now a cathedral, the donkey lay down on the ground.
they were then able to open the box and were surprised to find that it contained an image of our lady holding the child.
it is said that a bloody struggle was going on between the inhabitants of the region, but when they heard of the marvelous discovery in the abandoned box, they put down their weapons and immediately ceased fighting.
this is why the image was given the title of our lady of peace, whose liturgical celebration is held on november 21 in memory of its arrival at san miguel.
the statute is a dressed wood carving, with the national shield of el salvador embroidered on the front of the image's white robe.
the image holds a gold palm leaf in memory of the eruption of the chaparrastique volcano, which threatened to destroy the city with burning lava.
the frightened dwellers of san miguel brought out the statute of our lady of peace to the principal door of the cathedral, and at that precise moment the force of the lava changed direction, moving away from the city.
pope benedict xv authorized the canonical coronation of the image which took place on november 21, 1921.
our lady of peace is the patroness of the congregation of the sacred hearts of jesus and mary religious order, founded by peter coudrin in paris during the french revolution.
when the congregation of the sacred hearts of jesus and mary established the catholic church in hawaii, they consecrated the hawaiian islands under the protection of our lady of peace.
they erected the first roman catholic church in hawaii to her.
today, the cathedral of our lady of peace in honolulu is the oldest roman catholic cathedral in continuous use in the united states.
there are three famous statues of our lady of peace located in paris and honolulu.
the original is a wooden carving located at a convent of the congregation of the sacred hearts of jesus and mary in france.
a larger replica in bronze was hoisted above the altar and sanctuary at the cathedral of our lady of peace, while a third stands on a pedestal outside the cathedral.
the original statue of our lady of peace was ceremonially crowned on july 9, 1906 by the archbishop of paris in the name of pope pius x.  every july 9 since then, the congregation of the sacred hearts of jesus and mary have celebrated the feast of our lady of peace.
during the troubled years of world war i, pope benedict xv added our lady of peace to the litany of loreto, a sacred prayer in liturgy.
pope john paul ii consecrated and dedicated the basilica of our lady of peace of yamoussoukro in côte d'ivoire to our lady of peace.
it is the largest place of worship in africa.
elsewhere throughout the world, there are parish churches named in honor of our lady of peace in various forms, especially in ireland and the united states.
a notable example is the queen of peace church in bray, county wicklow, republic of ireland.
the edsa shrine in metro manila, the philippines, is also dedicated to our lady of peace.
located along edsa, it commemorates the alleged role of the virgin in the people power revolution of february 1986 that ended president ferdinand marcos' 21-year dictatorship.
mary is said to have shrouded the more than 1 million peaceful demonstrators on the highway from possible air attacks by troops loyal to marcos; a mural inside the shrine's nave depicts the "miracle".
the image associated with this particular shrine differs from traditional depictions of the title: mary, crowned and clad in golden robes, has her arms outstretched, while several white doves surround her.
the foujita chapel in reims, france, is dedicated to our lady, queen of peace, as a reaction to the horror and devastation caused by the 1945 atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki by american forces towards the end of the second world war.
the chapel at st. edward's university in austin, texas, is also dedicated to our lady queen of peace.
the monument to hispanicity (in spanish: monumento a la hispanidad) is located in the spanish city of madrid, in front of the museum of the americas in the university city.
opened on june 5, 1971 with the presence of the then prince juan carlos de borbón, it was created by agustín de la herrán matorras, a spanish sculptor.
the sculpture represents an old holm oak trunk that carries 3 figures in its upper part forming a group: a spanish warrior mounted on his horse that helps raise an indigenous woman, representing the union of spanish and hispanic american cultures.
on the back of the sculpture, there's an inscription alluding to the inauguration of the monument.

edith stein (religious name teresia benedicta a cruce ocd; also known as st. edith stein or st. teresa benedicta of the cross; 12 october 1891 – 9 august 1942) was a german jewish philosopher who converted to catholicism and became a discalced carmelite nun.
she is canonized as a martyr and saint of the catholic church, and she is one of six co-patron saints of europe.
she was born into an observant jewish family, but had become an atheist by her teenage years.
moved by the tragedies of world war i, in 1915 she took lessons to become a nursing assistant and worked in an infectious diseases hospital.
after completing her doctoral thesis from the university of göttingen in 1916, she obtained an assistantship at the university of freiburg.
from reading the works of the reformer of the carmelite order, teresa of ávila, she was drawn to the catholic faith.
she was baptized on 1 january 1922 into the catholic church.
at that point, she wanted to become a discalced carmelite nun, but was dissuaded by her spiritual mentors.
she then taught at a catholic school of education in speyer.
as a result of the requirement of an "aryan certificate" for civil servants promulgated by the nazi government in april 1933 as part of its law for the restoration of the professional civil service, she had to quit her teaching position.
she was admitted to the discalced carmelite monastery in cologne the following october.
she received the religious habit of the order as a novice in april 1934, taking the religious name teresa benedicta of the cross.
in 1938, she and her sister rosa, by then also a convert and an extern sister (tertiaries of the order, who would handle the community′s needs outside the monastery), were sent to the carmelite monastery in echt, netherlands, for their safety.
despite the nazi invasion of that state in 1940, they remained undisturbed until they were arrested by the nazis on 2 august 1942 and sent to the auschwitz concentration camp, where they are alleged to have died in the gas chamber on 9 august 1942.
stein was born in breslau (now wrocław, poland), lower silesia, into an observant jewish family.
she was the youngest of 11 children and was born on yom kippur, the holiest day of the hebrew calendar, which combined to make her a favorite of her mother.
she was a very gifted child who enjoyed learning, in a home where her mother encouraged critical thinking, and she greatly admired her mother's strong religious faith.
by her teenage years, however, stein had become an atheist.
though her father died while she was young, her widowed mother was determined to give her children a thorough education and consequently sent stein to study at the university of breslau (also known as "schlesische friedrich-wilhelms-universität").

in april 1913 stein arrived in göttingen in order to study for the summer semester with edmund husserl.
by the end of the summer she had decided to pursue her degree in philosophy under husserl and chose "empathy" as her thesis topic.
her studies were interrupted in july 1914 because of the outbreak of world war i. she then served as a volunteer wartime red cross nurse in an infectious diseases hospital at märisch-weisskirchen in 1915.  in 1916, stein moved to freiburg in order to complete her dissertation on empathy.
shortly before receiving her degree she agreed to become husserl's assistant.
after her dissertation entitled zum problem der einfühlung (on the problem of empathy) was awarded on 3 august 1916, which made her a doctor of philosophy with the summa cum laude honor, she began working independently as husserl's assistant.
in his 2007 thesis, "the philosophical contributions of edith stein", john c. wilhelmsson argues that stein influenced the work of husserl significantly during this period.
she then became a member of the faculty at the university of freiburg, where she worked as a teaching assistant to husserl, who had transferred to that institution.
because she was a woman, husserl did not support her submitting her habilitational thesis (a prerequisite for an academic chair) to the university of freiburg in 1918. her other thesis, psychische kausalität (sentient causality), submitted at the university of göttingen the following year, was likewise rejected.
while stein had earlier contacts with catholicism, it was her reading of the autobiography of the mystic teresa of ávila during summer holidays in bad bergzabern in 1921 that prompted her conversion.
baptized on 1 january 1922, and dissuaded by her spiritual advisers from immediately seeking entry to the religious life, she obtained a position to teach at the dominican nuns' school in speyer from 1923 to 1931. while there, she translated thomas aquinas' de veritate (of truth) into german, familiarized herself with catholic philosophy in general, and tried to bridge the phenomenology of her former teacher, husserl, to thomism.
she visited husserl and heidegger at freiburg in april 1929, the same month that heidegger gave a speech to husserl on his 70th birthday.
in 1932 she became a lecturer at the catholic church-affiliated institute for scientific pedagogy in münster, but antisemitic legislation passed by the nazi government forced her to resign the post in 1933. in a letter to pope pius xi, she denounced the nazi regime and asked the pope to openly denounce the regime "to put a stop to this abuse of christ's name."
as a child of the jewish people who, by the grace of god, for the past eleven years has also been a child of the catholic church, i dare to speak to the father of christianity about that which oppresses millions of germans.
for weeks we have seen deeds perpetrated in germany which mock any sense of justice and humanity, not to mention love of neighbor.
for years the leaders of national socialism have been preaching hatred of the jews.... but the responsibility must fall, after all, on those who brought them to this point and it also falls on those who keep silent in the face of such happenings.
everything that happened and continues to happen on a daily basis originates with a government that calls itself 'christian'.
for weeks not only jews but also thousands of faithful catholics in germany, and, i believe, all over the world, have been waiting and hoping for the church of christ to raise its voice to put a stop to this abuse of christ's name.
is not this idolization of race and governmental power which is being pounded into the public consciousness by the radio open heresy?
isn't the effort to destroy jewish blood an abuse of the holiest humanity of our savior, of the most blessed virgin and the apostles?
is not all this diametrically opposed to the conduct of our lord and savior, who, even on the cross, still prayed for his persecutors?
and isn't this a black mark on the record of this holy year which was intended to be a year of peace and reconciliation?
we all, who are faithful children of the church and who see the conditions in germany with open eyes, fear the worst for the prestige of the church, if the silence continues any longer.
her letter received no answer, and it is not known for certain whether the pope ever read it.
however, in 1937 the pope issued an encyclical written in german, mit brennender sorge (with burning anxiety), in which he criticized nazism, listed violations of the concordat between germany and the church of 1933, and condemned antisemitism.
stein entered the discalced carmelite monastery st. maria vom frieden (our lady of peace) in cologne in 1933 and took the religious name of teresa benedicta of the cross.
there she wrote her metaphysical book endliches und ewiges sein (finite and eternal being), which attempted to combine the philosophies of st. thomas aquinas, duns scotus and husserl.
to avoid the growing nazi threat, the order transferred edith and her sister, rosa, who was also a convert and an extern sister of the carmel, to the discalced carmelite monastery in echt, netherlands.
there she wrote studie über joannes a cruce: kreuzeswissenschaft ("studies on john of the cross: the science of the cross").
in her testament of 9 june 1939 she wrote: "i beg the lord to take my life and my death … for all concerns of the sacred hearts of jesus and mary and the holy church, especially for the preservation of our holy order, in particular the carmelite monasteries of cologne and echt, as atonement for the unbelief of the jewish people, and that the lord will be received by his own people and his kingdom shall come in glory, for the salvation of germany and the peace of the world, at last for my loved ones, living or dead, and for all god gave to me: that none of them shall go astray."
stein's move to echt prompted her to be more devout and even more observant of the carmelite rule.
after having her teaching position revoked by the implementation of the law for the restoration of the professional civil service, stein quickly eased back into the role of instructor at the convent in echt, teaching both fellow sisters and students within the community latin and philosophy.
even prior to the nazi occupation of the netherlands, stein believed she would not survive the war, going so far as to write the prioress to request her permission to "allow [stein] to offer [her]self to the heart of jesus as a sacrifice of atonement for true peace" and made a will.
her fellow sisters would later recount how stein began "quietly training herself for life in a concentration camp, by enduring cold and hunger" after the nazi invasion of the netherlands in may 1940.
ultimately, she would not be safe in the netherlands.
the dutch bishops' conference had a public statement read in all churches across the nation on 20 july 1942 condemning nazi racism.
in a retaliatory response on 26 july 1942 the reichskommissar of the netherlands, arthur seyss-inquart, ordered the arrest of all jewish converts who had previously been spared.
along with two hundred and forty-three baptized jews living in the netherlands, stein was arrested by the ss on 2 august 1942. stein and her sister rosa were imprisoned at the concentration camps of amersfoort and westerbork before being deported to auschwitz.
a dutch official at westerbork was so impressed by her sense of faith and calm, he offered her an escape plan.
stein vehemently refused his assistance, stating: "if somebody intervened at this point and took away [her] chance to share in the fate of [her] brothers and sisters, that would be utter annihilation."
on 7 august 1942, early in the morning, 987 jews were deported to the auschwitz concentration camp.
it was probably on 9 august that sister teresa benedicta of the cross, her sister, and many more of her people were killed in a mass gas chamber.
stein was beatified as a martyr on 1 may 1987 in cologne, germany, by pope john paul ii and then canonized by him 11 years later on 11 october 1998 in vatican city.
the miracle that was the basis for her canonization is the cure of benedicta mccarthy, a little girl who had swallowed a large amount of paracetamol (acetaminophen), which causes hepatic necrosis.
the young girl's father, emmanuel charles mccarthy, a priest of the melkite greek catholic church, immediately called together relatives and prayed for teresa's intercession.
shortly thereafter the nurses in the intensive care unit saw her sit up, completely healthy.
ronald kleinman, a pediatric specialist at massachusetts general hospital in boston who treated the girl, testified about her recovery to church tribunals, stating: "i was willing to say that it was miraculous."
mccarthy would later attend teresa's canonization.
teresa benedicta of the cross is one of the six patron saints of europe, together with benedict of nursia, cyril and methodius, bridget of sweden, and catherine of siena.
today there are many schools named in tribute to her, for example in darmstadt, germany, hengelo, netherlands, and mississauga, ontario, canada.
also named for her are a women's dormitory at the university of tübingen and a classroom building at the college of the holy cross in worcester, massachusetts.
the philosopher alasdair macintyre published a book in 2006 titled edith stein: a philosophical prologue, 1913–1922, in which he contrasted her living of her own personal philosophy with martin heidegger, whose actions during the nazi era, according to macintyre, suggested a "bifurcation of personality."
playwright arthur giron wrote edith stein, a play that was inspired by stein's life.
it was produced at the pittsburgh public theater in 1988.
in 1995, hungarian film director márta mészáros made a movie about the life and death of edith stein with the title a hetedik szoba (the seventh room/chamber), starring maia morgenstern.
in 1999, a memorial statue by german sculptor bert gerresheim was dedicated in cologne, germany.
the statue comprises three different views of stein reflecting her jewish and christian faith, and a pile of empty shoes representing the victims of the holocaust.
in 2008, a memorial stolperstein (polish: kamienie pamięci) was placed near stein's childhood home at 38 ul.
nowowiejska (formerly the michaelisstrasse) in wrocław.
in 2009 her bust was installed at the walhalla memorial near regensburg, germany.
in june 2009 the international association for the study of the philosophy of edith stein (iaspes) was founded, and held its first international conference at maynooth university, ireland, in order to advance the philosophical writings of stein.
on 6 june 2014, the 70th anniversary of d-day, a bell dedicated to her was named by prince charles at bayeux cathedral.
also in 2014, the book edith stein and regina jonas: religious visionaries in the time of the death camps, by emily leah silverman, was published.
the beatification of st. teresa benedicta as a martyr generated criticism.
critics argued that she was murdered because she was jewish by birth, rather than for her catholic faith, and that, in the words of daniel polish, the beatification seemed to "carry the tacit message encouraging conversionary activities" because "official discussion of the beatification seemed to make a point of conjoining stein's catholic faith with her death with 'fellow jews' in auschwitz."
the position of the catholic church is that st. teresa benedicta also died because of the dutch episcopacy's public condemnation of nazi racism in 1942; in other words, that she died because of the moral teaching of the church and is thus a true martyr.

cesária évora gcih (portuguese pronunciation: [sɨˈzaɾiɐ ˈɛvuɾɐ]; 27 august 1941 – 17 december 2011), more commonly cize, was a cape verdean singer-songwriter.
she received a grammy award in 2004 for her album voz d'amor.
nicknamed the "barefoot diva" for performing without shoes, she was known as the "queen of morna".
évora began singing as a young woman in bars in her hometown of mindelo.
cesária évora was born on 27 august 1941 in mindelo, são vicente, cape verde.
when she was seven years old her father, justino da cruz évora, who was a part-time musician, died, and at the age of ten she was placed in an orphanage, as her mother dona joana could not raise all six children.
at the age of 16, she was persuaded by a friend to sing in a sailors' tavern.
she grew up at the house in mindelo which other singers used from the 1940s to the 1970s, at 35 rua de moeda.
[citation needed] other cape verdean singers came to the house, including djô d'eloy, bana, eddy moreno, luis morais and manuel de novas (also known as manuel d'novas), and it was there she received her musical education.
in the 1960s, she started singing on portuguese cruise ships stopping at mindelo and on the local radio.
in 1985, at the invitation of cape verdean singer bana, she went to perform in portugal.
in lisbon she was discovered by the producer josé da silva and invited to record in paris.
she recorded the track "ausência", composed by yugoslav musician goran bregovic, which was released as the second track of the soundtrack of the film underground (1995) by emir kusturica.
évora's international success came only in 1988 with the release of her first commercial album la diva aux pieds nus, recorded in france.
before that album had been released, she recorded her first lp titled "cesária" in 1987. this album was later released on cd in 1995 as audiophile legends.
her 1992 album miss perfumado sold over 300,000 copies worldwide.
it included one of her most celebrated songs, "sodade".
in 1994, bau joined her touring band and two years later, he became her musical director up to september 1999.
her 1995 album cesária brought her international success and the first grammy award nomination.
in 1997, she won the kora all african music awards in three categories, including "best artist of west africa", "best album" and "merit of the jury".
in 2003, her album voz d'amor was awarded a grammy in the world music category.
in 2006, cesária met with alberto zeppieri, an italian songwriter, journalist and record producer  and agreed to duet with gianni morandi, gigi d'alessio and ron cesaria evora & ron - la voce dell' amore (voz d'amor).
the project, now in its fifth volume, gives visibility and raises funds for the un world food programme, for which cesária was the ambassador from 2003.
later in 2006, she released her next album rogamar.
it was a success and charted in six european countries including france, poland and the netherlands.
on her tour in australia in 2008, she suffered a stroke.
in 2009, she released her final album nha sentimento which was recorded in mindelo and paris by josé da silva.
the album reached number 6 in poland and number 21 in france.
in 2009, she was made a knightess of the french legion of honour by the french minister of culture and communications, christine albanel, the first cape verdean to become one.
she received her last award at the 2010 kora all african music awards, the "merit of the jury" award for the second time.
cesária évora dated eduardo de jon xalino when she lived at rua de moeda.
she was also a relative of the great bana.
her cousin was another singer hermínia da cruz fortes.
she was an aunt of antónio da rocha évora and xavier da cruz.
in 2010, évora performed a series of concerts, the last of which was in lisbon on 8 may.
two days later, after a heart attack, she underwent surgery at a local hospital in paris.
on the morning of 11 may 2010 she was taken off artificial pulmonary ventilation, and on 16 may she was discharged from the intensive-care unit and transported to a clinic for further treatment.
in late september 2011, évora's agent announced that she was ending her career due to poor health.
on 17 december 2011, aged 70, évora died in são vicente, cape verde, from respiratory failure and hypertension.
a spanish newspaper reported that 36 hours before her death she was still receiving people – and smoking – in her home in mindelo, popular for always having its doors open.
rytterknægten is the highest point on the danish island of bornholm at 162 metres (531 ft) above sea level.
the bierg is situated on a wooded bedrock of gaiter formations in the middle of almindingen forest.
aakirkeby is located about 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) to the southeast.
rytterknægten can be translated literally as knight's squire.
in times gone by, every knight had a squire who among other things helped him to mount his horse.
those who did not have squires found it convenient to mount from a flat stone such as the one close to the car park.
it is thought the stone might be behind the name of the location.
bornholm has both varied natural features, such as almindingen, hammeren, jons kapel, paradisbakkerne, and dueodde.
rytterknægten in the almindingen forest is not far from ekkodalen ("echo valley") to the east and the gamleborg castle (viking fortress) to the southwest.
the memorial tower is on the western side of the elevated area.
the entire surroundings are covered with dense forest, which has been growing and creating obstructions to the views from the tower.
the royal memorial tower, kongemindet, is located on rytterknægten.
designed by gottlieb bindesbøll, it commemorates the 1851 visit of frederick vii of denmark and countess danner.
the 12.6 metres (41 ft) structure was built by appreciative bornholmers in 1856, financed entirely with bornholmer resident donations as reverence to the king and the danish royal house.
it bears an inscription expressing the bornholmers' thanks for the visit, stating that it would be called kongemindet ("royal memorial").
translated into english, the memorial text on the plaque reads:
"in remembrance of his majesty king frederik vii's highest presence on this island from 8 till 16 august 1851 with his wife, the bornholmers out of subjectorial reverence erected this building in the year 1855 and gave it the name kongemindet."
the tower's granite masonry is decorated with lion heads, and originally had one staircase.
as the forest grew higher, obscuring the view, the tower was extended in 1899 by steel scaffolding a further 9 metres (30 ft), reaching a height at the top of 184 metres (604 ft) above sea level, which marks the highest point in denmark, same as the bavnehøj in jutland.
the design of the steel structure above the masonry structure is unusual in that it has two staircases - one to go up and the other to come down - which has limited the availability of space at the top of the tower.
during the world war ii, the germans added a radio transmitter, reaching a further 60 metres (200 ft) in height but this was later removed.
the tower has also been used for radar equipment, especially to monitor russian movements during the cold war.
the tower is used in the spring for ornithological observations.
the tower, with views over the entire island, is open to visitors free of charge during daylight hours throughout the year.

the australian sikh heritage trail, a group of interconnected pathways in adenia park, riverton, western australia, is a monument commemorating the history of sikhs in australia.
the location, adjacent to the canning river, is significant as the heritage-listed sikh cremation site.
the winding trail features interpretive signage, plaques, benches, a sheltered area, and a boardwalk by the river.
information on the signs is organised by theme, such as sikh farmers, sikh wrestlers, sikh anzacs, sikh hawkers and sikh entrepreneurs.
the australian sikh heritage trail was created through a collaboration of the state government's department of biodiversity, conservation and attractions (dbca), the city of canning, the australian sikh heritage association, and sikh gurdwara perth, over a period of three years.
:44 initial funding of $150,000 came from a lotterywest grant, while the city of canning contributed $35,000 for construction.
the department managed the project, with canning responsible for construction and maintenance.
the trail was officially opened on 17 april 2018 by minister for environment stephen dawson, acting local government and heritage minister bill johnston, and city of canning mayor paul ng.
the annual australian sikh heritage day was held there on 2 march 2019, attended by local and federal members of parliament, mayors, and the consul general of india in perth.
the 250-metre (820 ft) trail also presents information related to the whadjuk noongar culture and swan canning riverpark, and is part of the broader swan canning riverpark trails project of interpretation facilities called river journeys.
madani square, (bengali: মাদানী চত্বর, romanized: madani chottor, lit.
'madani square', sylheti: ꠝꠣꠖꠣꠘꠤ ꠌꠔ꠆ꠔꠞ), also known as madani chattar or madani point, is a monument in nayasarak road in sylhet built to commemorate hussain ahmed madani's contributions towards dawah in sylhet.
it was completed and opened on 18 february 2019 replacing the junction marking nayasarak point.
in early august 2017, the mayor of sylhet city corporation, ariful haque choudhury announced his plans to build a monument on nayasarak point and to rename it madani chattar, after the islamic scholar hussain ahmed madani.
due to the point being opposite noyasharak jame masjid – a mosque in which the scholar visited and stayed in since 1922, teaching the local community about islam.
during the opening ceremony, asjad madani, the scholar's son was also present.
the structure contains four pillars, designed like mihrabs, which increase in size and a circular base.
the tallest one contains a square where the arabic word "allahu" is written.
the chattar also contains lights which operate at night.
the preston monument is a stone marker that shows the tri-point (the place where three states meet) of oklahoma, colorado, and new mexico.
it is named after levi s. preston, who surveyed a portion of the new mexico–colorado border.

william shakespeare (bapt.
26 april 1564 – 23 april 1616)[a] was an english poet, playwright, and actor, widely regarded as the greatest writer in the english language and the world's greatest dramatist.
he is often called england's national poet and the "bard of avon" (or simply "the bard").
[b] his extant works, including collaborations, consist of some 39 plays,[c] 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship.
his plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright.
shakespeare was born and raised in stratford-upon-avon, warwickshire.
at the age of 18, he married anne hathaway, with whom he had three children: susanna and twins hamnet and judith.
sometime between 1585 and 1592, he began a successful career in london as an actor, writer, and part-owner of a playing company called the lord chamberlain's men, later known as the king's men.
at age 49 (around 1613), he appears to have retired to stratford, where he died three years later.
few records of shakespeare's private life survive; this has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance, his sexuality, his religious beliefs, and whether the works attributed to him were written by others.
shakespeare produced most of his known works between 1589 and 1613.
[d] his early plays were primarily comedies and histories and are regarded as some of the best work produced in these genres.
until about 1608, he wrote mainly tragedies, among them hamlet, othello, king lear, and macbeth, all considered to be among the finest works in the english language.
in the last phase of his life, he wrote tragicomedies (also known as romances) and collaborated with other playwrights.
many of shakespeare's plays were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy in his lifetime.
however, in 1623, two fellow actors and friends of shakespeare's, john heminges and henry condell, published a more definitive text known as the first folio, a posthumous collected edition of shakespeare's dramatic works that included all but two of his plays.
the volume was prefaced with a poem by ben jonson, in which jonson presciently hails shakespeare in a now-famous quote as "not of an age, but for all time".
throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, shakespeare's works have been continually adapted and rediscovered by new movements in scholarship and performance.
his plays remain popular and are studied, performed, and reinterpreted through various cultural and political contexts around the world.
william shakespeare was the son of john shakespeare, an alderman and a successful glover (glove-maker) originally from snitterfield, and mary arden, the daughter of an affluent landowning farmer.
he was born in stratford-upon-avon, where he was baptised on 26 april 1564. his date of birth is unknown, but is traditionally observed on 23 april, saint george's day.
this date, which can be traced to a mistake made by an 18th-century scholar, has proved appealing to biographers because shakespeare died on the same date in 1616. he was the third of eight children, and the eldest surviving son.
although no attendance records for the period survive, most biographers agree that shakespeare was probably educated at the king's new school in stratford, a free school chartered in 1553, about a quarter-mile (400 m) from his home.
grammar schools varied in quality during the elizabethan era, but grammar school curricula were largely similar: the basic latin text was standardised by royal decree, and the school would have provided an intensive education in grammar based upon latin classical authors.
at the age of 18, shakespeare married 26-year-old anne hathaway.
the consistory court of the diocese of worcester issued a marriage licence on 27 november 1582. the next day, two of hathaway's neighbours posted bonds guaranteeing that no lawful claims impeded the marriage.
the ceremony may have been arranged in some haste since the worcester chancellor allowed the marriage banns to be read once instead of the usual three times, and six months after the marriage anne gave birth to a daughter, susanna, baptised 26 may 1583. twins, son hamnet and daughter judith, followed almost two years later and were baptised 2 february 1585. hamnet died of unknown causes at the age of 11 and was buried 11 august 1596.
after the birth of the twins, shakespeare left few historical traces until he is mentioned as part of the london theatre scene in 1592. the exception is the appearance of his name in the "complaints bill" of a law case before the queen's bench court at westminster dated michaelmas term 1588 and 9 october 1589. scholars refer to the years between 1585 and 1592 as shakespeare's "lost years".
biographers attempting to account for this period have reported many apocryphal stories.
nicholas rowe, shakespeare's first biographer, recounted a stratford legend that shakespeare fled the town for london to escape prosecution for deer poaching in the estate of local squire thomas lucy.
shakespeare is also supposed to have taken his revenge on lucy by writing a scurrilous ballad about him.
another 18th-century story has shakespeare starting his theatrical career minding the horses of theatre patrons in london.
john aubrey reported that shakespeare had been a country schoolmaster.
some 20th-century scholars have suggested that shakespeare may have been employed as a schoolmaster by alexander hoghton of lancashire, a catholic landowner who named a certain "william shakeshafte" in his will.
little evidence substantiates such stories other than hearsay collected after his death, and shakeshafte was a common name in the lancashire area.
it is not known definitively when shakespeare began writing, but contemporary allusions and records of performances show that several of his plays were on the london stage by 1592. by then, he was sufficiently known in london to be attacked in print by the playwright robert greene in his groats-worth of wit:
... there is an upstart crow, beautified with our feathers, that with his tiger's heart wrapped in a player's hide, supposes he is as well able to bombast out a blank verse as the best of you: and being an absolute johannes factotum, is in his own conceit the only shake-scene in a country.
scholars differ on the exact meaning of greene's words, but most agree that greene was accusing shakespeare of reaching above his rank in trying to match such university-educated writers as christopher marlowe, thomas nashe, and greene himself (the so-called "university wits").
the italicised phrase parodying the line "oh, tiger's heart wrapped in a woman's hide" from shakespeare's henry vi, part 3, along with the pun "shake-scene", clearly identify shakespeare as greene's target.
as used here, johannes factotum ("jack of all trades") refers to a second-rate tinkerer with the work of others, rather than the more common "universal genius".
greene's attack is the earliest surviving mention of shakespeare's work in the theatre.
biographers suggest that his career may have begun any time from the mid-1580s to just before greene's remarks.
after 1594, shakespeare's plays were performed only by the lord chamberlain's men, a company owned by a group of players, including shakespeare, that soon became the leading playing company in london.
after the death of queen elizabeth in 1603, the company was awarded a royal patent by the new king james i, and changed its name to the king's men.
"all the world's a stage,and all the men and women merely players:they have their exits and their entrances;and one man in his time plays many parts ..."
—as you like it, act ii, scene 7, 139–142
in 1599, a partnership of members of the company built their own theatre on the south bank of the river thames, which they named the globe.
in 1608, the partnership also took over the blackfriars indoor theatre.
extant records of shakespeare's property purchases and investments indicate that his association with the company made him a wealthy man, and in 1597, he bought the second-largest house in stratford, new place, and in 1605, invested in a share of the parish tithes in stratford.
some of shakespeare's plays were published in quarto editions, beginning in 1594, and by 1598, his name had become a selling point and began to appear on the title pages.
shakespeare continued to act in his own and other plays after his success as a playwright.
the 1616 edition of ben jonson's works names him on the cast lists for every man in his humour (1598) and sejanus his fall (1603).
the absence of his name from the 1605 cast list for jonson's volpone is taken by some scholars as a sign that his acting career was nearing its end.
the first folio of 1623, however, lists shakespeare as one of "the principal actors in all these plays", some of which were first staged after volpone, although we cannot know for certain which roles he played.
in 1610, john davies of hereford wrote that "good will" played "kingly" roles.
in 1709, rowe passed down a tradition that shakespeare played the ghost of hamlet's father.
later traditions maintain that he also played adam in as you like it, and the chorus in henry v, though scholars doubt the sources of that information.
throughout his career, shakespeare divided his time between london and stratford.
in 1596, the year before he bought new place as his family home in stratford, shakespeare was living in the parish of st. helen's, bishopsgate, north of the river thames.
he moved across the river to southwark by 1599, the same year his company constructed the globe theatre there.
by 1604, he had moved north of the river again, to an area north of st paul's cathedral with many fine houses.
there, he rented rooms from a french huguenot named christopher mountjoy, a maker of ladies' wigs and other headgear.
rowe was the first biographer to record the tradition, repeated by johnson, that shakespeare retired to stratford "some years before his death".
he was still working as an actor in london in 1608; in an answer to the sharers' petition in 1635, cuthbert burbage stated that after purchasing the lease of the blackfriars theatre in 1608 from henry evans, the king's men "placed men players" there, "which were heminges, condell, shakespeare, etc.".
however, it is perhaps relevant that the bubonic plague raged in london throughout 1609. the london public playhouses were repeatedly closed during extended outbreaks of the plague (a total of over 60 months closure between may 1603 and february 1610), which meant there was often no acting work.
retirement from all work was uncommon at that time.
shakespeare continued to visit london during the years 1611–1614.
in 1612, he was called as a witness in bellott v. mountjoy, a court case concerning the marriage settlement of mountjoy's daughter, mary.
in march 1613, he bought a gatehouse in the former blackfriars priory; and from november 1614, he was in london for several weeks with his son-in-law, john hall.
after 1610, shakespeare wrote fewer plays, and none are attributed to him after 1613. his last three plays were collaborations, probably with john fletcher, who succeeded him as the house playwright of the king's men.
shakespeare died on 23 april 1616, at the age of 52.
[f] he died within a month of signing his will, a document which he begins by describing himself as being in "perfect health".
no extant contemporary source explains how or why he died.
half a century later, john ward, the vicar of stratford, wrote in his notebook: "shakespeare, drayton, and ben jonson had a merry meeting and, it seems, drank too hard, for shakespeare died of a fever there contracted", not an impossible scenario since shakespeare knew jonson and drayton.
of the tributes from fellow authors, one refers to his relatively sudden death: "we wondered, shakespeare, that thou went'st so soon / from the world's stage to the grave's tiring room.
"[g]
he was survived by his wife and two daughters.
susanna had married a physician, john hall, in 1607, and judith had married thomas quiney, a vintner, two months before shakespeare's death.
shakespeare signed his last will and testament on 25 march 1616; the following day, his new son-in-law, thomas quiney was found guilty of fathering an illegitimate son by margaret wheeler, who had died during childbirth.
thomas was ordered by the church court to do public penance, which would have caused much shame and embarrassment for the shakespeare family.
shakespeare bequeathed the bulk of his large estate to his elder daughter susanna under stipulations that she pass it down intact to "the first son of her body".
the quineys had three children, all of whom died without marrying.
the halls had one child, elizabeth, who married twice but died without children in 1670, ending shakespeare's direct line.
shakespeare's will scarcely mentions his wife, anne, who was probably entitled to one-third of his estate automatically.
[h] he did make a point, however, of leaving her "my second best bed", a bequest that has led to much speculation.
some scholars see the bequest as an insult to anne, whereas others believe that the second-best bed would have been the matrimonial bed and therefore rich in significance.
shakespeare was buried in the chancel of the holy trinity church two days after his death.
the epitaph carved into the stone slab covering his grave includes a curse against moving his bones, which was carefully avoided during restoration of the church in 2008:
good frend for iesvs sake forbeare,to digg the dvst encloased heare.bleste be yͤ man yͭ spares thes stones,and cvrst be he yͭ moves my bones.
[i]
(modern spelling: good friend, for jesus' sake forbear, / to dig the dust enclosed here.
/ blessed be the man that spares these stones, / and cursed be he that moves my bones.)
some time before 1623, a funerary monument was erected in his memory on the north wall, with a half-effigy of him in the act of writing.
its plaque compares him to nestor, socrates, and virgil.
in 1623, in conjunction with the publication of the first folio, the droeshout engraving was published.
shakespeare has been commemorated in many statues and memorials around the world, including funeral monuments in southwark cathedral and poets' corner in westminster abbey.
most playwrights of the period typically collaborated with others at some point, and critics agree that shakespeare did the same, mostly early and late in his career.
the first recorded works of shakespeare are richard iii and the three parts of henry vi, written in the early 1590s during a vogue for historical drama.
shakespeare's plays are difficult to date precisely, however, and studies of the texts suggest that titus andronicus, the comedy of errors, the taming of the shrew, and the two gentlemen of verona may also belong to shakespeare's earliest period.
his first histories, which draw heavily on the 1587 edition of raphael holinshed's chronicles of england, scotland, and ireland, dramatise the destructive results of weak or corrupt rule and have been interpreted as a justification for the origins of the tudor dynasty.
the early plays were influenced by the works of other elizabethan dramatists, especially thomas kyd and christopher marlowe, by the traditions of medieval drama, and by the plays of seneca.
the comedy of errors was also based on classical models, but no source for the taming of the shrew has been found, though it is related to a separate play of the same name and may have derived from a folk story.
like the two gentlemen of verona, in which two friends appear to approve of rape, the shrew's story of the taming of a woman's independent spirit by a man sometimes troubles modern critics, directors, and audiences.
shakespeare's early classical and italianate comedies, containing tight double plots and precise comic sequences, give way in the mid-1590s to the romantic atmosphere of his most acclaimed comedies.
a midsummer night's dream is a witty mixture of romance, fairy magic, and comic lowlife scenes.
shakespeare's next comedy, the equally romantic merchant of venice, contains a portrayal of the vengeful jewish moneylender shylock, which reflects elizabethan views but may appear derogatory to modern audiences.
the wit and wordplay of much ado about nothing, the charming rural setting of as you like it, and the lively merrymaking of twelfth night complete shakespeare's sequence of great comedies.
after the lyrical richard ii, written almost entirely in verse, shakespeare introduced prose comedy into the histories of the late 1590s, henry iv, parts 1 and 2, and henry v. his characters become more complex and tender as he switches deftly between comic and serious scenes, prose and poetry, and achieves the narrative variety of his mature work.
this period begins and ends with two tragedies: romeo and juliet, the famous romantic tragedy of sexually charged adolescence, love, and death; and julius caesar—based on sir thomas north's 1579 translation of plutarch's parallel lives—which introduced a new kind of drama.
according to shakespearean scholar james shapiro, in julius caesar, "the various strands of politics, character, inwardness, contemporary events, even shakespeare's own reflections on the act of writing, began to infuse each other".
in the early 17th century, shakespeare wrote the so-called "problem plays" measure for measure, troilus and cressida, and all's well that ends well and a number of his best known tragedies.
many critics believe that shakespeare's greatest tragedies represent the peak of his art.
the titular hero of one of shakespeare's greatest tragedies, hamlet, has probably been discussed more than any other shakespearean character, especially for his famous soliloquy which begins "to be or not to be; that is the question".
unlike the introverted hamlet, whose fatal flaw is hesitation, the heroes of the tragedies that followed, othello and king lear, are undone by hasty errors of judgement.
the plots of shakespeare's tragedies often hinge on such fatal errors or flaws, which overturn order and destroy the hero and those he loves.
in othello, the villain iago stokes othello's sexual jealousy to the point where he murders the innocent wife who loves him.
in king lear, the old king commits the tragic error of giving up his powers, initiating the events which lead to the torture and blinding of the earl of gloucester and the murder of lear's youngest daughter cordelia.
according to the critic frank kermode, "the play-offers neither its good characters nor its audience any relief from its cruelty".
in macbeth, the shortest and most compressed of shakespeare's tragedies, uncontrollable ambition incites macbeth and his wife, lady macbeth, to murder the rightful king and usurp the throne until their own guilt destroys them in turn.
in this play, shakespeare adds a supernatural element to the tragic structure.
his last major tragedies, antony and cleopatra and coriolanus, contain some of shakespeare's finest poetry and were considered his most successful tragedies by the poet and critic t.s.
eliot.
in his final period, shakespeare turned to romance or tragicomedy and completed three more major plays: cymbeline, the winter's tale, and the tempest, as well as the collaboration, pericles, prince of tyre.
less bleak than the tragedies, these four plays are graver in tone than the comedies of the 1590s, but they end with reconciliation and the forgiveness of potentially tragic errors.
some commentators have seen this change in mood as evidence of a more serene view of life on shakespeare's part, but it may merely reflect the theatrical fashion of the day.
shakespeare collaborated on two further surviving plays, henry viii and the two noble kinsmen, probably with john fletcher.
it is not clear for which companies shakespeare wrote his early plays.
the title page of the 1594 edition of titus andronicus reveals that the play had been acted by three different troupes.
after the plagues of 1592–93, shakespeare's plays were performed by his own company at the theatre and the curtain in shoreditch, north of the thames.
londoners flocked there to see the first part of henry iv, leonard digges recording, "let but falstaff come, hal, poins, the rest ... and you scarce shall have a room".
when the company found themselves in dispute with their landlord, they pulled the theatre down and used the timbers to construct the globe theatre, the first playhouse built by actors for actors, on the south bank of the thames at southwark.
the globe opened in autumn 1599, with julius caesar one of the first plays staged.
most of shakespeare's greatest post-1599 plays were written for the globe, including hamlet, othello, and king lear.
after the lord chamberlain's men were renamed the king's men in 1603, they entered a special relationship with the new king james.
although the performance records are patchy, the king's men performed seven of shakespeare's plays at court between 1 november 1604, and 31 october 1605, including two performances of the merchant of venice.
after 1608, they performed at the indoor blackfriars theatre during the winter and the globe during the summer.
the indoor setting, combined with the jacobean fashion for lavishly staged masques, allowed shakespeare to introduce more elaborate stage devices.
in cymbeline, for example, jupiter descends "in thunder and lightning, sitting upon an eagle: he throws a thunderbolt.
the ghosts fall on their knees."
the actors in shakespeare's company included the famous richard burbage, william kempe, henry condell and john heminges.
burbage played the leading role in the first performances of many of shakespeare's plays, including richard iii, hamlet, othello, and king lear.
the popular comic actor will kempe played the servant peter in romeo and juliet and dogberry in much ado about nothing, among other characters.
he was replaced around 1600 by robert armin, who played roles such as touchstone in as you like it and the fool in king lear.
in 1613, sir henry wotton recorded that henry viii "was set forth with many extraordinary circumstances of pomp and ceremony".
on 29 june, however, a cannon set fire to the thatch of the globe and burned the theatre to the ground, an event which pinpoints the date of a shakespeare play with rare precision.
in 1623, john heminges and henry condell, two of shakespeare's friends from the king's men, published the first folio, a collected edition of shakespeare's plays.
it contained 36 texts, including 18 printed for the first time.
many of the plays had already appeared in quarto versions—flimsy books made from sheets of paper folded twice to make four leaves.
no evidence suggests that shakespeare approved these editions, which the first folio describes as "stol'n and surreptitious copies".
nor did shakespeare plan or expect his works to survive in any form at all; those works likely would have faded into oblivion but for his friends' spontaneous idea, after his death, to create and publish the first folio.
alfred pollard termed some of the pre-1623 versions as "bad quartos" because of their adapted, paraphrased or garbled texts, which may in places have been reconstructed from memory.
where several versions of a play survive, each differs from the other.
the differences may stem from copying or printing errors, from notes by actors or audience members, or from shakespeare's own papers.
in some cases, for example, hamlet, troilus and cressida, and othello, shakespeare could have revised the texts between the quarto and folio editions.
in the case of king lear, however, while most modern editions do conflate them, the 1623 folio version is so different from the 1608 quarto that the oxford shakespeare prints them both, arguing that they cannot be conflated without confusion.
in 1593 and 1594, when the theatres were closed because of plague, shakespeare published two narrative poems on sexual themes, venus and adonis and the rape of lucrece.
he dedicated them to henry wriothesley, earl of southampton.
in venus and adonis, an innocent adonis rejects the sexual advances of venus; while in the rape of lucrece, the virtuous wife lucrece is raped by the lustful tarquin.
influenced by ovid's metamorphoses, the poems show the guilt and moral confusion that result from uncontrolled lust.
both proved popular and were often reprinted during shakespeare's lifetime.
a third narrative poem, a lover's complaint, in which a young woman laments her seduction by a persuasive suitor, was printed in the first edition of the sonnets in 1609. most scholars now accept that shakespeare wrote a lover's complaint.
critics consider that its fine qualities are marred by leaden effects.
the phoenix and the turtle, printed in robert chester's 1601 love's martyr, mourns the deaths of the legendary phoenix and his lover, the faithful turtle dove.
in 1599, two early drafts of sonnets 138 and 144 appeared in the passionate pilgrim, published under shakespeare's name but without his permission.
published in 1609, the sonnets were the last of shakespeare's non-dramatic works to be printed.
scholars are not certain when each of the 154 sonnets was composed, but evidence suggests that shakespeare wrote sonnets throughout his career for a private readership.
even before the two unauthorised sonnets appeared in the passionate pilgrim in 1599, francis meres had referred in 1598 to shakespeare's "sugred sonnets among his private friends".
few analysts believe that the published collection follows shakespeare's intended sequence.
he seems to have planned two contrasting series: one about uncontrollable lust for a married woman of dark complexion (the "dark lady"), and one about conflicted love for a fair young man (the "fair youth").
it remains unclear if these figures represent real individuals, or if the authorial "i" who addresses them represents shakespeare himself, though wordsworth believed that with the sonnets "shakespeare unlocked his heart".
"shall i compare thee to a summer's day?thou art more lovely and more temperate ..."
—lines from shakespeare's sonnet 18.
the 1609 edition was dedicated to a "mr.
w.h.
", credited as "the only begetter" of the poems.
it is not known whether this was written by shakespeare himself or by the publisher, thomas thorpe, whose initials appear at the foot of the dedication page; nor is it known who mr. w.h.
was, despite numerous theories, or whether shakespeare even authorised the publication.
critics praise the sonnets as a profound meditation on the nature of love, sexual passion, procreation, death, and time.
shakespeare's first plays were written in the conventional style of the day.
he wrote them in a stylised language that does not always spring naturally from the needs of the characters or the drama.
the poetry depends on extended, sometimes elaborate metaphors and conceits, and the language is often rhetorical—written for actors to declaim rather than speak.
the grand speeches in titus andronicus, in the view of some critics, often hold up the action, for example; and the verse in the two gentlemen of verona has been described as stilted.
"and pity, like a naked new-born babe,striding the blast, or heaven's cherubim, hors'dupon the sightless couriers of the air."
however, shakespeare soon began to adapt the traditional styles to his own purposes.
the opening soliloquy of richard iii has its roots in the self-declaration of vice in medieval drama.
at the same time, richard's vivid self-awareness looks forward to the soliloquies of shakespeare's mature plays.
no single play marks a change from the traditional to the freer style.
shakespeare combined the two throughout his career, with romeo and juliet perhaps the best example of the mixing of the styles.
by the time of romeo and juliet, richard ii, and a midsummer night's dream in the mid-1590s, shakespeare had begun to write a more natural poetry.
he increasingly tuned his metaphors and images to the needs of the drama itself.
shakespeare's standard poetic form was blank verse, composed in iambic pentameter.
in practice, this meant that his verse was usually unrhymed and consisted of ten syllables to a line, spoken with a stress on every second syllable.
the blank verse of his early plays is quite different from that of his later ones.
it is often beautiful, but its sentences tend to start, pause, and finish at the end of lines, with the risk of monotony.
once shakespeare mastered traditional blank verse, he began to interrupt and vary its flow.
this technique releases the new power and flexibility of the poetry in plays such as julius caesar and hamlet.
shakespeare uses it, for example, to convey the turmoil in hamlet's mind:
sir, in my heart there was a kind of fightingthat would not let me sleep.
methought i layworse than the mutines in the bilboes.
rashly—and prais'd be rashness for it—let us knowour indiscretion sometimes serves us well ...
after hamlet, shakespeare varied his poetic style further, particularly in the more emotional passages of the late tragedies.
the literary critic a. c. bradley described this style as "more concentrated, rapid, varied, and, in construction, less regular, not seldom twisted or elliptical".
in the last phase of his career, shakespeare adopted many techniques to achieve these effects.
these included run-on lines, irregular pauses and stops, and extreme variations in sentence structure and length.
in macbeth, for example, the language darts from one unrelated metaphor or simile to another: "was the hope drunk/ wherein you dressed yourself?"
(1.7.35–38); "... pity, like a naked new-born babe/ striding the blast, or heaven's cherubim, hors'd/ upon the sightless couriers of the air ..." (1.7.21–25).
the listener is challenged to complete the sense.
the late romances, with their shifts in time and surprising turns of plot, inspired a last poetic style in which long and short sentences are set against one another, clauses are piled up, subject and object are reversed, and words are omitted, creating an effect of spontaneity.
shakespeare combined poetic genius with a practical sense of the theatre.
like all playwrights of the time, he dramatised stories from sources such as plutarch and holinshed.
he reshaped each plot to create several centres of interest and to show as many sides of a narrative to the audience as possible.
this strength of design ensures that a shakespeare play can survive translation, cutting and wide interpretation without loss to its core drama.
as shakespeare's mastery grew, he gave his characters clearer and more varied motivations and distinctive patterns of speech.
he preserved aspects of his earlier style in the later plays, however.
in shakespeare's late romances, he deliberately returned to a more artificial style, which emphasised the illusion of theatre.
shakespeare's work has made a lasting impression on later theatre and literature.
in particular, he expanded the dramatic potential of characterisation, plot, language, and genre.
until romeo and juliet, for example, romance had not been viewed as a worthy topic for tragedy.
soliloquies had been used mainly to convey information about characters or events, but shakespeare used them to explore characters' minds.
his work heavily influenced later poetry.
the romantic poets attempted to revive shakespearean verse drama, though with little success.
critic george steiner described all english verse dramas from coleridge to tennyson as "feeble variations on shakespearean themes."
shakespeare influenced novelists such as thomas hardy, william faulkner, and charles dickens.
the american novelist herman melville's soliloquies owe much to shakespeare; his captain ahab in moby-dick is a classic tragic hero, inspired by king lear.
scholars have identified 20,000 pieces of music linked to shakespeare's works.
these include three operas by giuseppe verdi, macbeth, otello and falstaff, whose critical standing compares with that of the source plays.
shakespeare has also inspired many painters, including the romantics and the pre-raphaelites.
the swiss romantic artist henry fuseli, a friend of william blake, even translated macbeth into german.
the psychoanalyst sigmund freud drew on shakespearean psychology, in particular, that of hamlet, for his theories of human nature.
in shakespeare's day, english grammar, spelling, and pronunciation were less standardised than they are now, and his use of language helped shape modern english.
samuel johnson quoted him more often than any other author in his a dictionary of the english language, the first serious work of its type.
expressions such as "with bated breath" (merchant of venice) and "a foregone conclusion" (othello) have found their way into everyday english speech.
shakespeare's influence extends far beyond his native england and the english language.
his reception in germany was particularly significant; as early as the 18th century shakespeare was widely translated and popularised in germany, and gradually became a "classic of the german weimar era;" christoph martin wieland was the first to produce complete translations of shakespeare's plays in any language.
—ben jonson
shakespeare was not revered in his lifetime, but he received a large amount of praise.
in 1598, the cleric and author francis meres singled him out from a group of english writers as "the most excellent" in both comedy and tragedy.
the authors of the parnassus plays at st john's college, cambridge, numbered him with chaucer, gower, and spenser.
in the first folio, ben jonson called shakespeare the "soul of the age, the applause, delight, the wonder of our stage", although he had remarked elsewhere that "shakespeare wanted art".
between the restoration of the monarchy in 1660 and the end of the 17th century, classical ideas were in vogue.
as a result, critics of the time mostly rated shakespeare below john fletcher and ben jonson.
thomas rymer, for example, condemned shakespeare for mixing the comic with the tragic.
nevertheless, poet and critic john dryden rated shakespeare highly, saying of jonson, "i admire him, but i love shakespeare".
for several decades, rymer's view held sway; but during the 18th century, critics began to respond to shakespeare on his own terms and acclaim what they termed his natural genius.
a series of scholarly editions of his work, notably those of samuel johnson in 1765 and edmond malone in 1790, added to his growing reputation.
by 1800, he was firmly enshrined as the national poet.
in the 18th and 19th centuries, his reputation also spread abroad.
among those who championed him were the writers voltaire, goethe, stendhal, and victor hugo.
[j]
during the romantic era, shakespeare was praised by the poet and literary philosopher samuel taylor coleridge, and the critic august wilhelm schlegel translated his plays in the spirit of german romanticism.
in the 19th century, critical admiration for shakespeare's genius often bordered on adulation.
"this king shakespeare," the essayist thomas carlyle wrote in 1840, "does not he shine, in crowned sovereignty, over us all, as the noblest, gentlest, yet strongest of rallying signs; indestructible".
the victorians produced his plays as lavish spectacles on a grand scale.
the playwright and critic george bernard shaw mocked the cult of shakespeare worship as "bardolatry", claiming that the new naturalism of ibsen's plays had made shakespeare obsolete.
the modernist revolution in the arts during the early 20th century, far from discarding shakespeare, eagerly enlisted his work in the service of the avant-garde.
the expressionists in germany and the futurists in moscow mounted productions of his plays.
marxist playwright and director bertolt brecht devised an epic theatre under the influence of shakespeare.
the poet and critic t.s.
eliot argued against shaw that shakespeare's "primitiveness" in fact made him truly modern.
eliot, along with g. wilson knight and the school of new criticism, led a movement towards a closer reading of shakespeare's imagery.
in the 1950s, a wave of new critical approaches replaced modernism and paved the way for "post-modern" studies of shakespeare.
by the 1980s, shakespeare studies were open to movements such as structuralism, feminism, new historicism, african-american studies, and queer studies.
comparing shakespeare's accomplishments to those of leading figures in philosophy and theology, harold bloom wrote: "shakespeare was larger than plato and than st. augustine.
he encloses us because we see with his fundamental perceptions."
shakespeare's works include the 36 plays printed in the first folio of 1623, listed according to their folio classification as comedies, histories, and tragedies.
two plays not included in the first folio, the two noble kinsmen and pericles, prince of tyre, are now accepted as part of the canon, with today's scholars agreeing that shakespeare made major contributions to the writing of both.
no shakespearean poems were included in the first folio.
in the late 19th century, edward dowden classified four of the late comedies as romances, and though many scholars prefer to call them tragicomedies, dowden's term is often used.
in 1896, frederick s. boas coined the term "problem plays" to describe four plays: all's well that ends well, measure for measure, troilus and cressida, and hamlet.
"dramas as singular in theme and temper cannot be strictly called comedies or tragedies", he wrote.
"we may, therefore, borrow a convenient phrase from the theatre of today and class them together as shakespeare's problem plays."
the term, much debated and sometimes applied to other plays, remains in use, though hamlet is definitively classed as a tragedy.
around 230 years after shakespeare's death, doubts began to be expressed about the authorship of the works attributed to him.
proposed alternative candidates include francis bacon, christopher marlowe, and edward de vere, 17th earl of oxford.
several "group theories" have also been proposed.
only a small minority of academics believe there is reason to question the traditional attribution, but interest in the subject, particularly the oxfordian theory of shakespeare authorship, continues into the 21st century.
shakespeare conformed to the official state religion,[k] but his private views on religion have been the subject of debate.
shakespeare's will uses a protestant formula, and he was a confirmed member of the church of england, where he was married, his children were baptised, and where he is buried.
some scholars claim that members of shakespeare's family were catholics, at a time when practising catholicism in england was against the law.
shakespeare's mother, mary arden, certainly came from a pious catholic family.
the strongest evidence might be a catholic statement of faith signed by his father, john shakespeare, found in 1757 in the rafters of his former house in henley street.
however, the document is now lost and scholars differ as to its authenticity.
in 1591, the authorities reported that john shakespeare had missed church "for fear of process for debt", a common catholic excuse.
in 1606, the name of william's daughter susanna appears on a list of those who failed to attend easter communion in stratford.
other authors argue that there is a lack of evidence about shakespeare's religious beliefs.
scholars find evidence both for and against shakespeare's catholicism, protestantism, or lack of belief in his plays, but the truth may be impossible to prove.
few details of shakespeare's sexuality are known.
at 18, he married 26-year-old anne hathaway, who was pregnant.
susanna, the first of their three children, was born six months later on 26 may 1583. over the centuries, some readers have posited that shakespeare's sonnets are autobiographical, and point to them as evidence of his love for a young man.
others read the same passages as the expression of intense friendship rather than romantic love.
the 26 so-called "dark lady" sonnets, addressed to a married woman, are taken as evidence of heterosexual liaisons.
no written contemporary description of shakespeare's physical appearance survives, and no evidence suggests that he ever commissioned a portrait, so the droeshout engraving, which ben jonson approved of as a good likeness, and his stratford monument provide perhaps the best evidence of his appearance.
from the 18th century, the desire for authentic shakespeare portraits fuelled claims that various surviving pictures depicted shakespeare.
that demand also led to the production of several fake portraits, as well as misattributions, repaintings, and relabelling of portraits of other people.
the renaissance (uk: /rɪˈneɪsəns/ rin-ay-sənss, us: /ˈrɛnəsɑːns/ (listen) ren-ə-sahnss)[a] was a period in european history marking the transition from the middle ages to modernity and covering the 15th and 16th centuries.
it occurred after the crisis of the late middle ages and was associated with great social change.
in addition to the standard periodization, proponents of a long renaissance put its beginning in the 14th century and its end in the 17th century.
the traditional view focuses more on the early modern aspects of the renaissance and argues that it was a break from the past, but many historians today focus more on its medieval aspects and argue that it was an extension of the middle ages.
the intellectual basis of the renaissance was its version of humanism, derived from the concept of roman humanitas and the rediscovery of classical greek philosophy, such as that of protagoras, who said that "man is the measure of all things."
this new thinking became manifest in art, architecture, politics, science and literature.
early examples were the development of perspective in oil painting and the recycled knowledge of how to make concrete.
although the invention of metal movable type sped the dissemination of ideas from the later 15th century, the changes of the renaissance were not uniformly experienced across europe: the very first traces appear in italy as early as the late 13th century, in particular with the writings of dante and the paintings of giotto.
as a cultural movement, the renaissance encompassed innovative flowering of latin and vernacular literatures, beginning with the 14th-century resurgence of learning based on classical sources, which contemporaries credited to petrarch; the development of linear perspective and other techniques of rendering a more natural reality in painting; and gradual but widespread educational reform.
in politics, the renaissance contributed to the development of the customs and conventions of diplomacy, and in science to an increased reliance on observation and inductive reasoning.
although the renaissance saw revolutions in many intellectual pursuits, as well as social and political upheaval, it is perhaps best known for its artistic developments and the contributions of such polymaths as leonardo da vinci and michelangelo, who inspired the term "renaissance man".
the renaissance began in the 14th century in florence, italy.
various theories have been proposed to account for its origins and characteristics, focusing on a variety of factors including the social and civic peculiarities of florence at the time: its political structure, the patronage of its dominant family, the medici, and the migration of greek scholars and their texts to italy following the fall of constantinople to the ottoman turks.
other major centres were northern italian city-states such as venice, genoa, milan, bologna, and finally rome during the renaissance papacy.
the renaissance has a long and complex historiography, and, in line with general scepticism of discrete periodizations, there has been much debate among historians reacting to the 19th-century glorification of the "renaissance" and individual culture heroes as "renaissance men", questioning the usefulness of renaissance as a term and as a historical delineation.
the art historian erwin panofsky observed of this resistance to the concept of "renaissance":
it is perhaps no accident that the factuality of the italian renaissance has been most vigorously questioned by those who are not obliged to take a professional interest in the aesthetic aspects of civilization – historians of economic and social developments, political and religious situations, and, most particularly, natural science – but only exceptionally by students of literature and hardly ever by historians of art.
some observers have called into question whether the renaissance was a cultural "advance" from the middle ages, instead seeing it as a period of pessimism and nostalgia for classical antiquity, while social and economic historians, especially of the longue durée, have instead focused on the continuity between the two eras, which are linked, as panofsky observed, "by a thousand ties".
the term rinascita ('rebirth') first appeared in giorgio vasari's lives of the artists (c. 1550), anglicized as the renaissance in the 1830s.
the word has also been extended to other historical and cultural movements, such as the carolingian renaissance (8th and 9th centuries), ottonian renaissance (10th and 11th century), and the renaissance of the 12th century.
the renaissance was a cultural movement that profoundly affected european intellectual life in the early modern period.
beginning in italy, and spreading to the rest of europe by the 16th century, its influence was felt in art,  architecture, philosophy, literature, music, science and technology, politics, religion, and other aspects of intellectual inquiry.
renaissance scholars employed the humanist method in study, and searched for realism and human emotion in art.
renaissance humanists such as poggio bracciolini sought out in europe's monastic libraries the latin literary, historical, and oratorical texts of antiquity, while the fall of constantinople (1453) generated a wave of émigré greek scholars bringing precious manuscripts in ancient greek, many of which had fallen into obscurity in the west.
it is in their new focus on literary and historical texts that renaissance scholars differed so markedly from the medieval scholars of the renaissance of the 12th century, who had focused on studying greek and arabic works of natural sciences, philosophy and mathematics, rather than on such cultural texts.
in the revival of neo-platonism renaissance humanists did not reject christianity; quite the contrary, many of the greatest works of the renaissance were devoted to it, and the church patronized many works of renaissance art.
however, a subtle shift took place in the way that intellectuals approached religion that was reflected in many other areas of cultural life.
in addition, many greek christian works, including the greek new testament, were brought back from byzantium to western europe and engaged western scholars for the first time since late antiquity.
this new engagement with greek christian works, and particularly the return to the original greek of the new testament promoted by humanists lorenzo valla and erasmus, would help pave the way for the protestant reformation.
well after the first artistic return to classicism had been exemplified in the sculpture of nicola pisano, florentine painters led by masaccio strove to portray the human form realistically, developing techniques to render perspective and light more naturally.
political philosophers, most famously niccolò machiavelli, sought to describe political life as it really was, that is to understand it rationally.
a critical contribution to italian renaissance humanism, giovanni pico della mirandola wrote the famous text de hominis dignitate (oration on the dignity of man, 1486), which consists of a series of theses on philosophy, natural thought, faith and magic defended against any opponent on the grounds of reason.
in addition to studying classical latin and greek, renaissance authors also began increasingly to use vernacular languages; combined with the introduction of printing press, this would allow many more people access to books, especially the bible.
in all, the renaissance could be viewed as an attempt by intellectuals to study and improve the secular and worldly, both through the revival of ideas from antiquity, and through novel approaches to thought.
some scholars, such as rodney stark, play down the renaissance in favour of the earlier innovations of the italian city-states in the high middle ages, which married responsive government, christianity and the birth of capitalism.
this analysis argues that, whereas the great european states (france and spain) were absolutist monarchies, and others were under direct church control, the independent city republics of italy took over the principles of capitalism invented on monastic estates and set off a vast unprecedented commercial revolution that preceded and financed the renaissance.
many argue that the ideas characterizing the renaissance had their origin in late 13th-century florence, in particular with the writings of dante alighieri (1265–1321) and petrarch (1304–1374), as well as the paintings of giotto di bondone (1267–1337).
some writers date the renaissance quite precisely; one proposed starting point is 1401, when the rival geniuses lorenzo ghiberti and filippo brunelleschi competed for the contract to build the bronze doors for the baptistery of the florence cathedral (ghiberti won).
others see more general competition between artists and polymaths such as brunelleschi, ghiberti, donatello, and masaccio for artistic commissions as sparking the creativity of the renaissance.
yet it remains much debated why the renaissance began in italy, and why it began when it did.
accordingly, several theories have been put forward to explain its origins.
during the renaissance, money and art went hand in hand.
artists depended entirely on patrons while the patrons needed money to foster artistic talent.
wealth was brought to italy in the 14th, 15th, and 16th centuries by expanding trade into asia and europe.
silver mining in tyrol increased the flow of money.
luxuries from the eastern world, brought home during the crusades, increased the prosperity of genoa and venice.
jules michelet defined the 16th-century renaissance in france as a period in europe's cultural history that represented a break from the middle ages, creating a modern understanding of humanity and its place in the world.
in stark contrast to the high middle ages, when latin scholars focused almost entirely on studying greek and arabic works of natural science, philosophy and mathematics.
renaissance scholars were most interested in recovering and studying latin and greek literary, historical, and oratorical texts.
broadly speaking, this began in the 14th century with a latin phase, when renaissance scholars such as petrarch, coluccio salutati (1331–1406), niccolò de' niccoli (1364–1437) and poggio bracciolini (1380–1459) scoured the libraries of europe in search of works by such latin authors as cicero, lucretius, livy and seneca.
by the early 15th century, the bulk of the surviving such latin literature had been recovered; the greek phase of renaissance humanism was under way, as western european scholars turned to recovering ancient greek literary, historical, oratorical and theological texts.
unlike with latin texts, which had been preserved and studied in western europe since late antiquity, the study of ancient greek texts was very limited in medieval western europe.
ancient greek works on science, maths and philosophy had been studied since the high middle ages in western europe and in the medieval islamic world (normally in translation), but greek literary, oratorical and historical works (such as homer, the greek dramatists, demosthenes and thucydides) were not studied in either the latin or medieval islamic worlds; in the middle ages these sorts of texts were only studied by byzantine scholars.
one of the greatest achievements of renaissance scholars was to bring this entire class of greek cultural works back into western europe for the first time since late antiquity.
arab logicians had inherited greek ideas after they had invaded and conquered egypt and the levant.
their translations and commentaries on these ideas worked their way through the arab west into iberia and sicily, which became important centers for this transmission of ideas.
from the 11th to the 13th century, many schools dedicated to the translation of philosophical and scientific works from classical arabic to medieval latin were established in iberia.
most notably the toledo school of translators.
this work of translation from islamic culture, though largely unplanned and disorganized, constituted one of the greatest transmissions of ideas in history.
the movement to reintegrate the regular study of greek literary, historical, oratorical and theological texts back into the western european curriculum is usually dated to the 1396 invitation from coluccio salutati to the byzantine diplomat and scholar manuel chrysoloras (c. 1355–1415) to teach greek in florence.
this legacy was continued by a number of expatriate greek scholars, from basilios bessarion to leo allatius.
the unique political structures of late middle ages italy have led some to theorize that its unusual social climate allowed the emergence of a rare cultural efflorescence.
italy did not exist as a political entity in the early modern period.
instead, it was divided into smaller city states and territories: the kingdom of naples controlled the south, the republic of florence and the papal states at the center, the milanese and the genoese to the north and west respectively, and the venetians to the east.
fifteenth-century italy was one of the most urbanised areas in europe.
many of its cities stood among the ruins of ancient roman buildings; it seems likely that the classical nature of the renaissance was linked to its origin in the roman empire's heartland.
historian and political philosopher quentin skinner points out that otto of freising (c. 1114–1158), a german bishop visiting north italy during the 12th century, noticed a widespread new form of political and social organization, observing that italy appeared to have exited from feudalism so that its society was based on merchants and commerce.
linked to this was anti-monarchical thinking, represented in the famous early renaissance fresco cycle the allegory of good and bad government by ambrogio lorenzetti (painted 1338–1340), whose strong message is about the virtues of fairness, justice, republicanism and good administration.
holding both church and empire at bay, these city republics were devoted to notions of liberty.
skinner reports that there were many defences of liberty such as the matteo palmieri (1406–1475) celebration of florentine genius not only in art, sculpture and architecture, but "the remarkable efflorescence of moral, social and political philosophy that occurred in florence at the same time".
even cities and states beyond central italy, such as the republic of florence at this time, were also notable for their merchant republics, especially the republic of venice.
although in practice these were oligarchical, and bore little resemblance to a modern democracy, they did have democratic features and were responsive states, with forms of participation in governance and belief in liberty.
the relative political freedom they afforded was conducive to academic and artistic advancement.
likewise, the position of italian cities such as venice as great trading centres made them intellectual crossroads.
merchants brought with them ideas from far corners of the globe, particularly the levant.
venice was europe's gateway to trade with the east, and a producer of fine glass, while florence was a capital of textiles.
the wealth such business brought to italy meant large public and private artistic projects could be commissioned and individuals had more leisure time for study.
one theory that has been advanced is that the devastation in florence caused by the black death, which hit europe between 1348 and 1350, resulted in a shift in the world view of people in 14th-century italy.
italy was particularly badly hit by the plague, and it has been speculated that the resulting familiarity with death caused thinkers to dwell more on their lives on earth, rather than on spirituality and the afterlife.
it has also been argued that the black death prompted a new wave of piety, manifested in the sponsorship of religious works of art.
however, this does not fully explain why the renaissance occurred specifically in italy in the 14th century.
the black death was a pandemic that affected all of europe in the ways described, not only italy.
the renaissance's emergence in italy was most likely the result of the complex interaction of the above factors.
the plague was carried by fleas on sailing vessels returning from the ports of asia, spreading quickly due to lack of proper sanitation: the population of england, then about 4.2 million, lost 1.4 million people to the bubonic plague.
florence's population was nearly halved in the year 1347. as a result of the decimation in the populace the value of the working class increased, and commoners came to enjoy more freedom.
to answer the increased need for labor, workers traveled in search of the most favorable position economically.
the demographic decline due to the plague had economic consequences: the prices of food dropped and land values declined by 30–40% in most parts of europe between 1350 and 1400. landholders faced a great loss, but for ordinary men and women it was a windfall.
the survivors of the plague found not only that the prices of food were cheaper but also that lands were more abundant, and many of them inherited property from their dead relatives.
the spread of disease was significantly more rampant in areas of poverty.
epidemics ravaged cities, particularly children.
plagues were easily spread by lice, unsanitary drinking water, armies, or by poor sanitation.
children were hit the hardest because many diseases, such as typhus and syphilis, target the immune system, leaving young children without a fighting chance.
children in city dwellings were more affected by the spread of disease than the children of the wealthy.
the black death caused greater upheaval to florence's social and political structure than later epidemics.
despite a significant number of deaths among members of the ruling classes, the government of florence continued to function during this period.
formal meetings of elected representatives were suspended during the height of the epidemic due to the chaotic conditions in the city, but a small group of officials was appointed to conduct the affairs of the city, which ensured continuity of government.
it has long been a matter of debate why the renaissance began in florence, and not elsewhere in italy.
scholars have noted several features unique to florentine cultural life that may have caused such a cultural movement.
many have emphasized the role played by the medici, a banking family and later ducal ruling house, in patronizing and stimulating the arts.
lorenzo de' medici (1449–1492) was the catalyst for an enormous amount of arts patronage, encouraging his countrymen to commission works from the leading artists of florence, including leonardo da vinci, sandro botticelli, and michelangelo buonarroti.
works by neri di bicci, botticelli, da vinci and filippino lippi had been commissioned additionally by the convent of san donato in scopeto in florence.
the renaissance was certainly underway before lorenzo de' medici came to power – indeed, before the medici family itself achieved hegemony in florentine society.
some historians have postulated that florence was the birthplace of the renaissance as a result of luck, i.e., because "great men" were born there by chance: leonardo da vinci, botticelli and michelangelo were all born in tuscany.
arguing that such chance seems improbable, other historians have contended that these "great men" were only able to rise to prominence because of the prevailing cultural conditions at the time.
in some ways, renaissance humanism was not a philosophy but a method of learning.
in contrast to the medieval scholastic mode, which focused on resolving contradictions between authors, renaissance humanists would study ancient texts in the original and appraise them through a combination of reasoning and empirical evidence.
humanist education was based on the programme of 'studia humanitatis', the study of five humanities: poetry, grammar, history, moral philosophy and rhetoric.
although historians have sometimes struggled to define humanism precisely, most have settled on "a middle of the road definition... the movement to recover, interpret, and assimilate the language, literature, learning and values of ancient greece and rome".
above all, humanists asserted "the genius of man ... the unique and extraordinary ability of the human mind".
humanist scholars shaped the intellectual landscape throughout the early modern period.
political philosophers such as niccolò machiavelli and thomas more revived the ideas of greek and roman thinkers and applied them in critiques of contemporary government.
pico della mirandola wrote the "manifesto" of the renaissance, the oration on the dignity of man, a vibrant defence of thinking.
matteo palmieri (1406–1475), another humanist, is most known for his work della vita civile ("on civic life"; printed 1528), which advocated civic humanism, and for his influence in refining the tuscan vernacular to the same level as latin.
palmieri drew on roman philosophers and theorists, especially cicero, who, like palmieri, lived an active public life as a citizen and official, as well as a theorist and philosopher and also quintilian.
perhaps the most succinct expression of his perspective on humanism is in a 1465 poetic work la città di vita, but an earlier work, della vita civile, is more wide-ranging.
composed as a series of dialogues set in a country house in the mugello countryside outside florence during the plague of 1430, palmieri expounds on the qualities of the ideal citizen.
the dialogues include ideas about how children develop mentally and physically, how citizens can conduct themselves morally, how citizens and states can ensure probity in public life, and an important debate on the difference between that which is pragmatically useful and that which is honest.
the humanists believed that it is important to transcend to the afterlife with a perfect mind and body, which could be attained with education.
the purpose of humanism was to create a universal man whose person combined intellectual and physical excellence and who was capable of functioning honorably in virtually any situation.
this ideology was referred to as the uomo universale, an ancient greco-roman ideal.
education during the renaissance was mainly composed of ancient literature and history as it was thought that the classics provided moral instruction and an intensive understanding of human behavior.
a unique characteristic of some renaissance libraries is that they were open to the public.
these libraries were places where ideas were exchanged and where scholarship and reading were considered both pleasurable and beneficial to the mind and soul.
as freethinking was a hallmark of the age, many libraries contained a wide range of writers.
classical texts could be found alongside humanist writings.
these informal associations of intellectuals profoundly influenced renaissance culture.
some of the richest "bibliophiles" built libraries as temples to books and knowledge.
a number of libraries appeared as manifestations of immense wealth joined with a love of books.
in some cases, cultivated library builders were also committed to offering others the opportunity to use their collections.
prominent aristocrats and princes of the church created great libraries for the use of their courts, called "court libraries", and were housed in lavishly designed monumental buildings decorated with ornate woodwork, and the walls adorned with frescoes (murray, stuart a.p.)
renaissance art marks a cultural rebirth at the close of the middle ages and rise of the modern world.
one of the distinguishing features of renaissance art was its development of highly realistic linear perspective.
giotto di bondone (1267–1337) is credited with first treating a painting as a window into space, but it was not until the demonstrations of architect filippo brunelleschi (1377–1446) and the subsequent writings of leon battista alberti (1404–1472) that perspective was formalized as an artistic technique.
the development of perspective was part of a wider trend towards realism in the arts.
painters developed other techniques, studying light, shadow, and, famously in the case of leonardo da vinci, human anatomy.
underlying these changes in artistic method was a renewed desire to depict the beauty of nature and to unravel the axioms of aesthetics, with the works of leonardo, michelangelo and raphael representing artistic pinnacles that were much imitated by other artists.
other notable artists include sandro botticelli, working for the medici in florence, donatello, another florentine, and titian in venice, among others.
in the netherlands, a particularly vibrant artistic culture developed.
the work of hugo van der goes and jan van eyck was particularly influential on the development of painting in italy, both technically with the introduction of oil paint and canvas, and stylistically in terms of naturalism in representation.
later, the work of pieter brueghel the elder would inspire artists to depict themes of everyday life.
in architecture, filippo brunelleschi was foremost in studying the remains of ancient classical buildings.
with rediscovered knowledge from the 1st-century writer vitruvius and the flourishing discipline of mathematics, brunelleschi formulated the renaissance style that emulated and improved on classical forms.
his major feat of engineering was building the dome of the florence cathedral.
another building demonstrating this style is the church of st. andrew in mantua, built by alberti.
the outstanding architectural work of the high renaissance was the rebuilding of st. peter's basilica, combining the skills of bramante, michelangelo, raphael, sangallo and maderno.
during the renaissance, architects aimed to use columns, pilasters, and entablatures as an integrated system.
the roman orders types of columns are used: tuscan and composite.
these can either be structural, supporting an arcade or architrave, or purely decorative, set against a wall in the form of pilasters.
one of the first buildings to use pilasters as an integrated system was in the old sacristy (1421–1440) by brunelleschi.
arches, semi-circular or (in the mannerist style) segmental, are often used in arcades, supported on piers or columns with capitals.
there may be a section of entablature between the capital and the springing of the arch.
alberti was one of the first to use the arch on a monumental.
renaissance vaults do not have ribs; they are semi-circular or segmental and on a square plan, unlike the gothic vault, which is frequently rectangular.
renaissance artists were not pagans, although they admired antiquity and kept some ideas and symbols of the medieval past.
nicola pisano (c. 1220–c.
1278) imitated classical forms by portraying scenes from the bible.
his annunciation, from the baptistry at pisa, demonstrates that classical models influenced italian art before the renaissance took root as a literary movement
applied innovation extended to commerce.
at the end of the 15th century luca pacioli published the first work on bookkeeping, making him the founder of accounting.
the rediscovery of ancient texts and the invention of the printing press democratized learning and allowed a faster propagation of more widely distributed ideas.
in the first period of the italian renaissance, humanists favoured the study of humanities over natural philosophy or applied mathematics, and their reverence for classical sources further enshrined the aristotelian and ptolemaic views of the universe.
writing around 1450, nicholas cusanus anticipated the heliocentric worldview of copernicus, but in a philosophical fashion.
science and art were intermingled in the early renaissance, with polymath artists such as leonardo da vinci making observational drawings of anatomy and nature.
da vinci set up controlled experiments in water flow, medical dissection, and systematic study of movement and aerodynamics, and he devised principles of research method that led fritjof capra to classify him as the "father of modern science".
other examples of da vinci's contribution during this period include machines designed to saw marbles and lift monoliths, and new discoveries in acoustics, botany, geology, anatomy, and mechanics.
a suitable environment had developed to question scientific doctrine.
the discovery in 1492 of the new world by christopher columbus challenged the classical worldview.
the works of ptolemy (in geography) and galen (in medicine) were found to not always match everyday observations.
as the protestant reformation and counter-reformation clashed, the northern renaissance showed a decisive shift in focus from aristotelean natural philosophy to chemistry and the biological sciences (botany, anatomy, and medicine).
the willingness to question previously held truths and search for new answers resulted in a period of major scientific advancements.
some view this as a "scientific revolution", heralding the beginning of the modern age, others as an acceleration of a continuous process stretching from the ancient world to the present day.
significant scientific advances were made during this time by galileo galilei, tycho brahe and johannes kepler.
copernicus, in de revolutionibus orbium coelestium (on the revolutions of the heavenly spheres), posited that the earth moved around the sun.
de humani corporis fabrica (on the workings of the human body) by andreas vesalius, gave a new confidence to the role of dissection, observation, and the mechanistic view of anatomy.
another important development was in the process for discovery, the scientific method, focusing on empirical evidence and the importance of mathematics, while discarding aristotelian science.
early and influential proponents of these ideas included copernicus, galileo, and francis bacon.
the new scientific method led to great contributions in the fields of astronomy, physics, biology, and anatomy.

during the renaissance, extending from 1450 to 1650, every continent was visited and mostly mapped by europeans, except the south polar continent now known as antarctica.
this development is depicted in the large world map nova totius terrarum orbis tabula made by the dutch cartographer joan blaeu in 1648 to commemorate the peace of westphalia.
in 1492, christopher columbus sailed across the atlantic ocean from spain seeking a direct route to asia.
he accidentally stumbled upon the americas, but believed he had reached the east indies.
in 1606, the dutch navigator willem janszoon sailed from the east indies in the voc ship duyfken and landed in australia.
he charted about 300 km of the west coast of cape york peninsula in queensland.
more than thirty dutch expeditions followed, mapping sections of the north, west and south coasts.
in 1642–1643, abel tasman circumnavigated the continent, proving that it was not joined to the imagined south polar continent.
by 1650, dutch cartographers had mapped most of the coastline of the continent, which they named new holland, except the east coast which was charted in 1770 by captain cook.
the long-imagined south polar continent was eventually sighted in 1820. throughout the renaissance it had been known as terra australis, or 'australia' for short.
however, after that name was transferred to new holland in the nineteenth century, the new name of 'antarctica' was bestowed on the south polar continent.
from this changing society emerged a common, unifying musical language, in particular the polyphonic style of the franco-flemish school.
the development of printing made distribution of music possible on a wide scale.
demand for music as entertainment and as an activity for educated amateurs increased with the emergence of a bourgeois class.
dissemination of chansons, motets, and masses throughout europe coincided with the unification of polyphonic practice into the fluid style that culminated in the second half of the sixteenth century in the work of composers such as palestrina, lassus, victoria and william byrd.
the new ideals of humanism, although more secular in some aspects, developed against a christian backdrop, especially in the northern renaissance.
much, if not most, of the new art was commissioned by or in dedication to the church.
however, the renaissance had a profound effect on contemporary theology, particularly in the way people perceived the relationship between man and god.
many of the period's foremost theologians were followers of the humanist method, including erasmus, zwingli, thomas more, martin luther, and john calvin.
the renaissance began in times of religious turmoil.
the late middle ages was a period of political intrigue surrounding the papacy, culminating in the western schism, in which three men simultaneously claimed to be true bishop of rome.
while the schism was resolved by the council of constance (1414), a resulting reform movement known as conciliarism sought to limit the power of the pope.
although the papacy eventually emerged supreme in ecclesiastical matters by the fifth council of the lateran (1511), it was dogged by continued accusations of corruption, most famously in the person of pope alexander vi, who was accused variously of simony, nepotism and fathering four children (most of whom were married off, presumably for the consolidation of power) while a cardinal.
churchmen such as erasmus and luther proposed reform to the church, often based on humanist textual criticism of the new testament.
in october 1517 luther published the 95 theses, challenging papal authority and criticizing its perceived corruption, particularly with regard to instances of sold indulgences.
[d] the 95 theses led to the reformation, a break with the roman catholic church that previously claimed hegemony in western europe.
humanism and the renaissance therefore played a direct role in sparking the reformation, as well as in many other contemporaneous religious debates and conflicts.
pope paul iii came to the papal throne (1534–1549) after the sack of rome in 1527, with uncertainties prevalent in the catholic church following the protestant reformation.
nicolaus copernicus dedicated de revolutionibus orbium coelestium (on the revolutions of the celestial spheres) to paul iii, who became the grandfather of alessandro farnese (cardinal), who had paintings by titian, michelangelo, and raphael, as well as an important collection of drawings, and who commissioned the masterpiece of giulio clovio, arguably the last major illuminated manuscript, the farnese hours.
by the 15th century, writers, artists, and architects in italy were well aware of the transformations that were taking place and were using phrases such as modi antichi (in the antique manner) or alle romana et alla antica (in the manner of the romans and the ancients) to describe their work.
in the 1330s petrarch referred to pre-christian times as antiqua (ancient) and to the christian period as nova (new).
from petrarch's italian perspective, this new period (which included his own time) was an age of national eclipse.leonardo bruni was the first to use tripartite periodization in his history of the florentine people (1442).
bruni's first two periods were based on those of petrarch, but he added a third period because he believed that italy was no longer in a state of decline.
flavio biondo used a similar framework in decades of history from the deterioration of the roman empire (1439–1453).
humanist historians argued that contemporary scholarship restored direct links to the classical period, thus bypassing the medieval period, which they then named for the first time the "middle ages".
the term first appears in latin in 1469 as media tempestas (middle times).
the term rinascita (rebirth) first appeared, however, in its broad sense in giorgio vasari's lives of the artists, 1550, revised 1568. vasari divides the age into three phases: the first phase contains cimabue, giotto, and arnolfo di cambio; the second phase contains masaccio, brunelleschi, and donatello; the third centers on leonardo da vinci and culminates with michelangelo.
it was not just the growing awareness of classical antiquity that drove this development, according to vasari, but also the growing desire to study and imitate nature.
in the 15th century, the renaissance spread rapidly from its birthplace in florence to the rest of italy and soon to the rest of europe.
the invention of the printing press by german printer johannes gutenberg allowed the rapid transmission of these new ideas.
as it spread, its ideas diversified and changed, being adapted to local culture.
in the 20th century, scholars began to break the renaissance into regional and national movements.
in england, the sixteenth century marked the beginning of the english renaissance with the work of writers william shakespeare, christopher marlowe, edmund spenser, sir thomas more, francis bacon, sir philip sidney, as well as great artists, architects (such as inigo jones who introduced italianate architecture to england), and composers such as thomas tallis, john taverner, and william byrd.
the word "renaissance" is borrowed from the french language, where it means "re-birth".
it was first used in the eighteenth century and was later popularized by french historian jules michelet (1798–1874) in his 1855 work, histoire de france (history of france).
in 1495 the italian renaissance arrived in france, imported by king charles viii after his invasion of italy.
a factor that promoted the spread of secularism was the inability of the church to offer assistance against the black death.
francis i imported italian art and artists, including leonardo da vinci, and built ornate palaces at great expense.
writers such as françois rabelais, pierre de ronsard, joachim du bellay and michel de montaigne, painters such as jean clouet, and musicians such as jean mouton also borrowed from the spirit of the renaissance.
in 1533, a fourteen-year-old caterina de' medici (1519–1589), born in florence to lorenzo de' medici, duke of urbino and madeleine de la tour d'auvergne, married henry ii of france, second son of king francis i and queen claude.
though she became famous and infamous for her role in france's religious wars, she made a direct contribution in bringing arts, sciences and music (including the origins of ballet) to the french court from her native florence.
in the second half of the 15th century, the renaissance spirit spread to germany and the low countries, where the development of the printing press (ca.
1450) and renaissance artists such as albrecht dürer (1471–1528) predated the influence from italy.
in the early protestant areas of the country humanism became closely linked to the turmoil of the protestant reformation, and the art and writing of the german renaissance frequently reflected this dispute.
however, the gothic style and medieval scholastic philosophy remained exclusively until the turn of the 16th century.
emperor maximilian i of habsburg (ruling 1493–1519) was the first truly renaissance monarch of the holy roman empire.
after italy, hungary was the first european country where the renaissance appeared.
the renaissance style came directly from italy during the quattrocento to hungary first in the central european region, thanks to the development of early hungarian-italian relationships—not only in dynastic connections, but also in cultural, humanistic and commercial relations—growing in strength from the 14th century.
the relationship between hungarian and italian gothic styles was a second reason—exaggerated breakthrough of walls is avoided, preferring clean and light structures.
large-scale building schemes provided ample and long term work for the artists, for example, the building of the friss (new) castle in buda, the castles of visegrád, tata and várpalota.
in sigismund's court there were patrons such as pipo spano, a descendant of the scolari family of florence, who invited manetto ammanatini and masolino da pannicale to hungary.
the new italian trend combined with existing national traditions to create a particular local renaissance art.
acceptance of renaissance art was furthered by the continuous arrival of humanist thought in the country.
many young hungarians studying at italian universities came closer to the florentine humanist center, so a direct connection with florence evolved.
the growing number of italian traders moving to hungary, specially to buda, helped this process.
new thoughts were carried by the humanist prelates, among them vitéz jános, archbishop of esztergom, one of the founders of hungarian humanism.
during the long reign of emperor sigismund of luxemburg the royal castle of buda became probably the largest gothic palace of the late middle ages.
king matthias corvinus (r. 1458–1490) rebuilt the palace in early renaissance style and further expanded it.
after the marriage in 1476 of king matthias to beatrice of naples, buda became one of the most important artistic centres of the renaissance north of the alps.
the most important humanists living in matthias' court were antonio bonfini and the famous hungarian poet janus pannonius.
andrás hess set up a printing press in buda in 1472. matthias corvinus's library, the bibliotheca corviniana, was europe's greatest collections of secular books: historical chronicles, philosophic and scientific works in the 15th century.
his library was second only in size to the vatican library.
(however, the vatican library mainly contained bibles and religious materials.)
in 1489, bartolomeo della fonte of florence wrote that lorenzo de' medici founded his own greek-latin library encouraged by the example of the hungarian king.
corvinus's library is part of unesco world heritage.
matthias started at least two major building projects.
the works in buda and visegrád began in about 1479. two new wings and a hanging garden were built at the royal castle of buda, and the palace at visegrád was rebuilt in renaissance style.
matthias appointed the italian chimenti camicia and the dalmatian giovanni dalmata to direct these projects.
matthias commissioned the leading italian artists of his age to embellish his palaces: for instance, the sculptor benedetto da majano and the painters filippino lippi and andrea mantegna worked for him.
a copy of mantegna's portrait of matthias survived.
matthias also hired the italian military engineer aristotele fioravanti to direct the rebuilding of the forts along the southern frontier.
he had new monasteries built in late gothic style for the franciscans in kolozsvár, szeged and hunyad, and for the paulines in fejéregyháza.
in the spring of 1485, leonardo da vinci travelled to hungary on behalf of sforza to meet king matthias corvinus, and was commissioned by him to paint a madonna.
matthias enjoyed the company of humanists and had lively discussions on various topics with them.
the fame of his magnanimity encouraged many scholars—mostly italian—to settle in buda.
antonio bonfini, pietro ranzano, bartolomeo fonzio, and francesco bandini spent many years in matthias's court.
this circle of educated men introduced the ideas of neoplatonism to hungary.
like all intellectuals of his age, matthias was convinced that the movements and combinations of the stars and planets exercised influence on individuals' life and on the history of nations.
galeotto marzio described him as "king and astrologer", and antonio bonfini said matthias "never did anything without consulting the stars".
upon his request, the famous astronomers of the age, johannes regiomontanus and marcin bylica, set up an observatory in buda and installed it with astrolabes and celestial globes.
regiomontanus dedicated his book on navigation that was used by christopher columbus to matthias.
other important figures of hungarian renaissance include bálint balassi (poet), sebestyén tinódi lantos (poet), bálint bakfark (composer and lutenist), and master ms (fresco painter).
culture in the netherlands at the end of the 15th century was influenced by the italian renaissance through trade via bruges, which made flanders wealthy.
its nobles commissioned artists who became known across europe.
in science, the anatomist andreas vesalius led the way; in cartography, gerardus mercator's map assisted explorers and navigators.
in art, dutch and flemish renaissance painting ranged from the strange work of hieronymus bosch to the everyday life depictions of pieter brueghel the elder.
the renaissance in northern europe has been termed the "northern renaissance".
while renaissance ideas were moving north from italy, there was a simultaneous southward spread of some areas of innovation, particularly in music.
the music of the 15th-century burgundian school defined the beginning of the renaissance in music, and the polyphony of the netherlanders, as it moved with the musicians themselves into italy, formed the core of the first true international style in music since the standardization of gregorian chant in the 9th century.
the culmination of the netherlandish school was in the music of the italian composer palestrina.
at the end of the 16th century italy again became a center of musical innovation, with the development of the polychoral style of the venetian school, which spread northward into germany around 1600.
the paintings of the italian renaissance differed from those of the northern renaissance.
italian renaissance artists were among the first to paint secular scenes, breaking away from the purely religious art of medieval painters.
northern renaissance artists initially remained focused on religious subjects, such as the contemporary religious upheaval portrayed by albrecht dürer.
later, the works of pieter bruegel influenced artists to paint scenes of daily life rather than religious or classical themes.
it was also during the northern renaissance that flemish brothers hubert and jan van eyck perfected the oil painting technique, which enabled artists to produce strong colors on a hard surface that could survive for centuries.
a feature of the northern renaissance was its use of the vernacular in place of latin or greek, which allowed greater freedom of expression.
this movement had started in italy with the decisive influence of dante alighieri on the development of vernacular languages; in fact the focus on writing in italian has neglected a major source of florentine ideas expressed in latin.
the spread of the printing press technology boosted the renaissance in northern europe as elsewhere, with venice becoming a world center of printing.
an early italian humanist who came to poland in the mid-15th century was filippo buonaccorsi.
many italian artists came to poland with bona sforza of milan, when she married king sigismund i the old in 1518. this was supported by temporarily strengthened monarchies in both areas, as well as by newly established universities.
the polish renaissance lasted from the late 15th to the late 16th century and was the golden age of polish culture.
ruled by the jagiellon dynasty, the kingdom of poland (from 1569 known as the polish–lithuanian commonwealth) actively participated in the broad european renaissance.
the multi-national polish state experienced a substantial period of cultural growth thanks in part to a century without major wars – aside from conflicts in the sparsely populated eastern and southern borderlands.
the reformation spread peacefully throughout the country (giving rise to the polish brethren), while living conditions improved, cities grew, and exports of agricultural products enriched the population, especially the nobility (szlachta) who gained dominance in the new political system of golden liberty.
the polish renaissance architecture has three periods of development.
the greatest monument of this style in the territory of the former duchy of pomerania is the ducal castle in szczecin.
although italian renaissance had a modest impact in portuguese arts, portugal was influential in broadening the european worldview, stimulating humanist inquiry.
renaissance arrived through the influence of wealthy italian and flemish merchants who invested in the profitable commerce overseas.
as the pioneer headquarters of european exploration, lisbon flourished in the late 15th century, attracting experts who made several breakthroughs in mathematics, astronomy and naval technology, including pedro nunes, joão de castro, abraham zacuto and martin behaim.
cartographers pedro reinel, lopo homem, estêvão gomes and diogo ribeiro made crucial advances in mapping the world.
apothecary tomé pires and physicians garcia de orta and cristóvão da costa collected and published works on plants and medicines, soon translated by flemish pioneer botanist carolus clusius.
in architecture, the huge profits of the spice trade financed a sumptuous composite style in the first decades of the 16th century, the manueline, incorporating maritime elements.
the primary painters were nuno gonçalves, gregório lopes and vasco fernandes.
in music, pedro de escobar and duarte lobo produced four songbooks, including the cancioneiro de elvas.
in literature, sá de miranda introduced italian forms of verse.
bernardim ribeiro developed pastoral romance, plays by gil vicente fused it with popular culture, reporting the changing times, and luís de camões inscribed the portuguese feats overseas in the epic poem os lusíadas.
travel literature especially flourished: joão de barros, castanheda, antónio galvão, gaspar correia, duarte barbosa, and fernão mendes pinto, among others, described new lands and were translated and spread with the new printing press.
after joining the portuguese exploration of brazil in 1500, amerigo vespucci coined the term new world, in his letters to lorenzo di pierfrancesco de' medici.
the intense international exchange produced several cosmopolitan humanist scholars, including francisco de holanda, andré de resende and damião de góis, a friend of erasmus who wrote with rare independence on the reign of king manuel i. diogo and andré de gouveia made relevant teaching reforms via france.
foreign news and products in the portuguese factory in antwerp attracted the interest of thomas more and albrecht dürer to the wider world.
there, profits and know-how helped nurture the dutch renaissance and golden age, especially after the arrival of the wealthy cultured jewish community expelled from portugal.
renaissance trends from italy and central europe influenced russia in many ways.
their influence was rather limited, however, due to the large distances between russia and the main european cultural centers and the strong adherence of russians to their orthodox traditions and byzantine legacy.
prince ivan iii introduced renaissance architecture to russia by inviting a number of architects from italy, who brought new construction techniques and some renaissance style elements with them, while in general following the traditional designs of russian architecture.
in 1475 the bolognese architect aristotele fioravanti came to rebuild the cathedral of the dormition in the moscow kremlin, which had been damaged in an earthquake.
fioravanti was given the 12th-century vladimir cathedral as a model, and he produced a design combining traditional russian style with a renaissance sense of spaciousness, proportion and symmetry.
in 1485 ivan iii commissioned the building of the royal residence, terem palace, within the kremlin, with aloisio da milano as the architect of the first three floors.
he and other italian architects also contributed to the construction of the kremlin walls and towers.
the small banquet hall of the russian tsars, called the palace of facets because of its facetted upper story, is the work of two italians, marco ruffo and pietro solario, and shows a more italian style.
in 1505, an italian known in russia as aleviz novyi or aleviz fryazin arrived in moscow.
he may have been the venetian sculptor, alevisio lamberti da montagne.
he built twelve churches for ivan iii, including the cathedral of the archangel, a building remarkable for the successful blending of russian tradition, orthodox requirements and renaissance style.
it is believed that the cathedral of the metropolitan peter in vysokopetrovsky monastery, another work of aleviz novyi, later served as an inspiration for the so-called octagon-on-tetragon architectural form in the moscow baroque of the late 17th century.
between the early 16th and the late 17th centuries, an original tradition of stone tented roof architecture developed in russia.
it was quite unique and different from the contemporary renaissance architecture elsewhere in europe, though some research terms the style 'russian gothic' and compares it with the european gothic architecture of the earlier period.
the italians, with their advanced technology, may have influenced the invention of the stone tented roof (the wooden tents were known in russia and europe long before).
according to one hypothesis, an italian architect called petrok maly may have been an author of the ascension church in kolomenskoye, one of the earliest and most prominent tented roof churches.
by the 17th century the influence of renaissance painting resulted in russian icons becoming slightly more realistic, while still following most of the old icon painting canons, as seen in the works of bogdan saltanov, simon ushakov, gury nikitin, karp zolotaryov and other russian artists of the era.
gradually the new type of secular portrait painting appeared, called parsúna (from "persona" – person), which was transitional style between abstract iconographics and real paintings.
in the mid 16th-century russians adopted printing from central europe, with ivan fyodorov being the first known russian printer.
in the 17th century printing became widespread, and woodcuts became especially popular.
that led to the development of a special form of folk art known as lubok printing, which persisted in russia well into the 19th century.
a number of technologies from the european renaissance period were adopted by russia rather early and subsequently perfected to become a part of a strong domestic tradition.
mostly these were military technologies, such as cannon casting adopted by at least the 15th century.
the tsar cannon, which is the world's largest bombard by caliber, is a masterpiece of russian cannon making.
it was cast in 1586 by andrey chokhov and is notable for its rich, decorative relief.
another technology, that according to one hypothesis originally was brought from europe by the italians, resulted in the development of vodka, the national beverage of russia.
as early as 1386 genoese ambassadors brought the first aqua vitae ("water of life") to moscow and presented it to grand duke dmitry donskoy.
the genoese likely developed this beverage with the help of the alchemists of provence, who used an arab-invented distillation apparatus to convert grape must into alcohol.
a moscovite monk called isidore used this technology to produce the first original russian vodka c. 1430.
the renaissance arrived in the iberian peninsula through the mediterranean possessions of the aragonese crown and the city of valencia.
many early spanish renaissance writers come from the kingdom of aragon, including ausiàs march and joanot martorell.
in the kingdom of castile, the early renaissance was heavily influenced by the italian humanism, starting with writers and poets such as the marquis of santillana, who introduced the new italian poetry to spain in the early 15th century.
other writers, such as jorge manrique, fernando de rojas, juan del encina, juan boscán almogáver and garcilaso de la vega, kept a close resemblance to the italian canon.
miguel de cervantes's masterpiece don quixote is credited as the first western novel.
renaissance humanism flourished in the early 16th century, with influential writers such as philosopher juan luis vives, grammarian antonio de nebrija and natural historian pedro de mexía.
later spanish renaissance tended towards religious themes and mysticism, with poets such as fray luis de león, teresa of ávila and john of the cross, and treated issues related to the exploration of the new world, with chroniclers and writers such as inca garcilaso de la vega and bartolomé de las casas, giving rise to a body of work, now known as spanish renaissance literature.
the late renaissance in spain produced artists such as el greco and composers such as tomás luis de victoria and antonio de cabezón.
the italian artist and critic giorgio vasari (1511–1574) first used the term rinascita in his book the lives of the artists (published 1550).
in the book vasari attempted to define what he described as a break with the barbarities of gothic art: the arts (he held) had fallen into decay with the collapse of the roman empire and only the tuscan artists, beginning with cimabue (1240–1301) and giotto (1267–1337) began to reverse this decline in the arts.
vasari saw ancient art as central to the rebirth of italian art.
however, only in the 19th century did the french word renaissance achieve popularity in describing the self-conscious cultural movement based on revival of roman models that began in the late 13th century.
french historian jules michelet (1798–1874) defined "the renaissance" in his 1855 work histoire de france as an entire historical period, whereas previously it had been used in a more limited sense.
for michelet, the renaissance was more a development in science than in art and culture.
he asserted that it spanned the period from columbus to copernicus to galileo; that is, from the end of the 15th century to the middle of the 17th century.
moreover, michelet distinguished between what he called, "the bizarre and monstrous" quality of the middle ages and the democratic values that he, as a vocal republican, chose to see in its character.
a french nationalist, michelet also sought to claim the renaissance as a french movement.
the swiss historian jacob burckhardt (1818–1897) in his the civilization of the renaissance in italy (1860), by contrast, defined the renaissance as the period between giotto and michelangelo in italy, that is, the 14th to mid-16th centuries.
he saw in the renaissance the emergence of the modern spirit of individuality, which the middle ages had stifled.
his book was widely read and became influential in the development of the modern interpretation of the italian renaissance.
however, buckhardt has been accused[by whom?]
of setting forth a linear whiggish view of history in seeing the renaissance as the origin of the modern world.
more recently, some historians have been much less keen to define the renaissance as a historical age, or even as a coherent cultural movement.
the historian randolph starn, of the university of california berkeley, stated in 1998:
rather than a period with definitive beginnings and endings and consistent content in between, the renaissance can be (and occasionally has been) seen as a movement of practices and ideas to which specific groups and identifiable persons variously responded in different times and places.
it would be in this sense a network of diverse, sometimes converging, sometimes conflicting cultures, not a single, time-bound culture.
there is debate about the extent to which the renaissance improved on the culture of the middle ages.
both michelet and burckhardt were keen to describe the progress made in the renaissance towards the modern age.
burckhardt likened the change to a veil being removed from man's eyes, allowing him to see clearly.
in the middle ages both sides of human consciousness – that which was turned within as that which was turned without – lay dreaming or half awake beneath a common veil.
the veil was woven of faith, illusion, and childish prepossession, through which the world and history were seen clad in strange hues.
on the other hand, many historians now point out that most of the negative social factors popularly associated with the medieval period—poverty, warfare, religious and political persecution, for example—seem to have worsened in this era, which saw the rise of machiavellian politics, the wars of religion, the corrupt borgia popes, and the intensified witch hunts of the 16th century.
many people who lived during the renaissance did not view it as the "golden age" imagined by certain 19th-century authors, but were concerned by these social maladies.
significantly, though, the artists, writers, and patrons involved in the cultural movements in question believed they were living in a new era that was a clean break from the middle ages.
some marxist historians prefer to describe the renaissance in material terms, holding the view that the changes in art, literature, and philosophy were part of a general economic trend from feudalism towards capitalism, resulting in a bourgeois class with leisure time to devote to the arts.
johan huizinga (1872–1945) acknowledged the existence of the renaissance but questioned whether it was a positive change.
in his book the autumn of the middle ages, he argued that the renaissance was a period of decline from the high middle ages, destroying much that was important.
the latin language, for instance, had evolved greatly from the classical period and was still a living language used in the church and elsewhere.
the renaissance obsession with classical purity halted its further evolution and saw latin revert to its classical form.
robert s. lopez has contended that it was a period of deep economic recession.
meanwhile, george sarton and lynn thorndike have both argued that scientific progress was perhaps less original than has traditionally been supposed.
finally, joan kelly argued that the renaissance led to greater gender dichotomy, lessening the agency women had had during the middle ages.
some historians have begun to consider the word renaissance to be unnecessarily loaded, implying an unambiguously positive rebirth from the supposedly more primitive "dark ages", the middle ages.
most historians now prefer to use the term "early modern" for this period, a more neutral designation that highlights the period as a transitional one between the middle ages and the modern era.
others such as roger osborne have come to consider the italian renaissance as a repository of the myths and ideals of western history in general, and instead of rebirth of ancient ideas as a period of great innovation.
the term renaissance has also been used to define periods outside of the 15th and 16th centuries.
charles h. haskins (1870–1937), for example, made a case for a renaissance of the 12th century.
other historians have argued for a carolingian renaissance in the 8th and 9th centuries, and still later for an ottonian renaissance in the 10th century.
other periods of cultural rebirth have also been termed "renaissances", such as the bengal renaissance, tamil renaissance, nepal bhasa renaissance, al-nahda or the harlem renaissance.
the term can also be used in cinema.
in animation, the disney renaissance is a period that spanned the years from 1989 to 1999 which saw the studio return to the level of quality not witnessed since their golden age or animation.
the san francisco renaissance was a vibrant period of exploratory poetry and fiction writing in that city in the mid-20th century.
notes
rapid accumulation of knowledge, which has characterized the development of science since the 17th century, had never occurred before that time.
the new kind of scientific activity emerged only in a few countries of western europe, and it was restricted to that small area for about two hundred years.
(since the 19th century, scientific knowledge has been assimilated by the rest of the world).

the national churchill museum (formerly the winston churchill memorial and library), located on the westminster college campus in fulton, missouri, united states, commemorates the life and times of sir winston churchill.
in 1946, winston churchill delivered his famous "sinews of peace" address in the westminster historic gymnasium.
in it was the line: "from stettin in the baltic to trieste in the adriatic an iron curtain has descended across the continent."
this sentence caused the oration to become known as the "iron curtain" speech.
"sinews of peace" heralded the beginning of the cold war.
the national churchill museum comprises three distinct but related elements:  the church of st mary aldermanbury, the museum, and the "breakthrough" sculpture.
the central element of the national churchill museum is the church of st. mary, aldermanbury, a 17th-century church moved stone-by-stone to fulton from the city of london.
today, the church looks much as it did in 1677—carefully restored to recreate the building that architect christopher wren designed after the great fire of london destroyed the original 12th-century church.
beneath the church is the churchill museum, renovated in 2006.  through interactive new exhibits, the museum tells churchill's story, discussing his personal and political life and his legacy.
additionally, the clementine-spencer churchill reading room houses an extensive research collection about churchill and his era.
outside the church stands the "breakthrough" sculpture, formed from eight sections of the berlin wall.
churchill's granddaughter, artist edwina sandys, designed the sculpture in order to commemorate both the "sinews of peace" speech and the fall of the berlin wall.
in 1946, winston churchill travelled to westminster college in order to deliver his famous "sinews of peace" address as a part of the john findlay green foundation lecture series.
an extraordinary confluence of circumstances conspired to bring winston churchill to westminster.
at the time, the college had a unique connection to u.s. president harry s. truman's administration—major general harry vaughan, a graduate of westminster college.
college president franc mccluer asked vaughan to see what president truman could do to induce churchill to come to westminster.
president truman thought the idea of bringing churchill to missouri (truman's native state) was a wonderful idea.
on the bottom of churchill's invitation from westminster college truman wrote:  "this is a wonderful school in my home state.
hope you can do it.
i will introduce you."
so it was that two world leaders, winston churchill and president harry truman, descended onto the campus of westminster college in fulton, missouri.
churchill arrived on the westminster college campus on march 5, 1946 and delivered his address.
churchill's "sinews of peace" delineated the complications and tensions of that moment in world history—less than a year after world war ii.
churchill had been watching the soviet union with increasing concern.
churchill feared another war.
"a shadow has fallen upon the scenes so lately lighted by the allied victory," he said; adding, "whatever conclusion may be drawn from these facts ... this is certainly not the liberated europe we fought to build up.
nor is it one which contains the essentials of permanent peace."
churchill noted the tensions mounting between eastern and western europe.
"from stettin in the baltic to trieste in the adriatic," he said, "an 'iron curtain' has descended across the continent."
churchill then predicted what he called the formation of the "soviet sphere."
in order to counterbalance the mounting power of the soviet union, churchill called for a "fraternal association of the english-speaking peoples."
churchill hoped the united states and britain would work together towards the "permanent prevention of war" and "establish conditions of freedom and democracy" all over the globe.
the cooperation of these two nations, he hoped, would create the "sinews of peace."
he went on to encourage the leaders of both the united states and britain to begin peace-talks with the soviet union.
churchill feared the outbreak of a new world war, especially in light of the development of nuclear weapons.
"now war can find any nation, wherever it may dwell between dusk and dawn," he warned.
churchill knew all too well the devastation conventional bombs had wreaked on britain during the blitz—a similar campaign waged with nuclear weapons would be too horrible to imagine.
reactions to the "sinews of peace" were mixed; some were suspicious of churchill's proposed alliance between the united states and britain and accused churchill of warmongering.
others were provoked by churchill's claim that "there never was a war in history easier to prevent by timely action than the one which has just desolated such great areas of the globe."
"it could have been prevented in my opinion without firing a shot ...," he continued, "but no one would listen and one by one we were all sucked into the awful whirlpool.
... "
others lauded the speech for its prophetic qualities—particularly churchill's anticipation of the formation of the soviet bloc—a view shared by many modern-day historians.
churchill predicted the cold war, sounded its early warning, and defined the central problems that would occupy the leaders that followed him.
as a result, the "sinews of peace" is widely regarded as churchill's most famous peace-time address.
[by whom?
]president harry truman predicted that churchill's address would put both fulton and westminster college on the map—he was right.
today, visitors to the museum may view filmed selections of the speech.
the lectern and chair that churchill used are on display in the museum.
in 1961, westminster college president dr. robert l. d. davidson began formulating a plan to commemorate both winston churchill's life and the "sinews of peace."
a life magazine feature on war-ravaged, soon-to-be-demolished christopher wren churches in london prompted the suggestion to import one of the churches to serve as both a memorial and the college chapel.
after further investigation, college officials selected st. mary, aldermanbury as the church to be saved.
st. mary, aldermanbury was not only an ideal choice because of its relatively small size, but also because of its unique and nearly 1,000 year history.
st. mary's was a focal-point of religious life in the old city of london, serving as a place of worship for literary greats william shakespeare and john milton.
founded in the late 12th century, the church shared in the rich history of london, surviving both the english reformation, restoration, and numerous civil wars.
however, on september 2, 1666, the church was destroyed in the great fire of london, which swept through st. mary's parish, burning for five days.
when the fire was finally subdued, almost the entire city of london north of the river thames—including st. mary, aldermanbury—lay in ruins.
with so much of london in ruins, reconstruction of the many churches destroyed in the fire was of secondary importance—many would never be rebuilt.
however, st. mary, aldermanbury became the ninth church restored, placing it among the earliest.
with approval for rebuilding granted in 1670, famed architect christopher wren began renovating the church in 1672 with the removal of 1,068 cubic yards (817 m3) of rubble.
wren rebuilt the church on part of the old foundation with as much original stones as could be salvaged—saving both time and money.
by 1677, the work was essentially complete; the cupola was added to the tower in 1679.
st. mary, aldermanbury's location near the heart of london again proved dangerous during world war ii at the height of the blitz.
on sunday evening, december 29, 1940, the german luftwaffe mounted a massive air raid, dropping 20,000 incendiary bombs on london.
luftwaffe command planned the raid to coincide with low tide to impede fire fighting.
it worked.
the shortage of water and the scale of the attack forced firemen to let parts of the city burn.
at 6:45 pm, st. mary's suffered a direct hit by an incendiary bomb, quickly setting the church ablaze.
noel mander, a young fire warden, later recorded his observations:
"we couldn't do anything because the water mains had all been fractured, and the river was so low, record low, they couldn't suck water up from there.
they could do little, very little.
...  i saw that night st. mary, aldermanbury; st. vedast-alias-foster, my own church—i saw them all burn, and it was a sensation that i will never forget—hearing the bells fall down the tower, hearing the organs burn, because the hot air blowing through the organ pipes almost sounded as if the poor old organs were shrieking in agony in their destruction."
that night, thirteen christopher wren churches shared st. mary's fate.
by morning, only its blackened shell and tower stood—the roof, the interior, and all furnishings destroyed.in the war's aftermath, there were neither the funds nor the need to rebuild all of london's destroyed churches.
after standing as a ruin for twenty years, st. mary, aldermanbury joined the list of parish churches slated for demolition.
it was at this point that westminster college stepped in to save the church from destruction and to reconstruct it in order to honor one of britain's most famous citizens—winston churchill.
churchill's inspiration for the british people during the blitz made the reconstruction of st. mary, aldermanbury, itself a victim of the blitz, a fitting memorial to the man.
"i am honored ...," churchill said.

"the removal of a ruined christopher wren church, largely destroyed by enemy action in london in 1941  [sic], and its reconstruction and re-dedication at fulton, is an imaginative concept.
... "  "it may symbolize in the eyes of the english-speaking peoples," he continued, "the ideals of anglo-american association on which rest, now as before, so many of our hopes for peace and the future of mankind."
it took four years to finalize preparations for the project, and to raise the necessary $2 million (more than $10 million today) to make the move a reality.
actor richard burton was a major promoter and donor, appearing on the tonight show with jack paar on nbc, who made a direct appeal.
in 1965, the removal process began.
workers carefully labeled each of the 7,000 stones, noting their location in the church.
more than 700 tons of blocks were shipped to fulton via boat and rail.
in the moving process, the carefully ordered stones became scrambled.
builders in fulton faced a jigsaw puzzle that spread over an acre.
with several of the church's stones piled beside him, president truman arrived in fulton to turn the symbolic first shovel for the reconstruction on april 19, 1964, before a crowd of 10,000 on-lookers.
fittingly, former westminster president franc mccluer and the other living members of the 1946 platform party joined in the ceremonies.
the foundation stone was laid in october 1966, 300 years after the great fire of london, and by may 1967, the last stone was in place.
however, the project was far from complete.
a meticulous re-creation of the church's interior required another two years of work.
english woodcarvers, working from pre-war photographs, created carvings for the pulpit, baptismal font, and balcony.
blenko glass company, an american firm, manufactured the glass for the windows and a dutch firm cast five new bronze bells for the tower.
noel mander, the fire warden who watched st. mary's burn in 1940, built the organ and helped assure authenticity of the interior details.
there are only two departures from the wren design:  an organ gallery in the west wall and a window in the tower to illuminate the stairway.
after nearly five years of work on what the times called "perhaps the biggest jigsaw puzzle in the history of architecture," dedication ceremonies for st. mary's and the national churchill museum were held on may 7, 1969.   during the course of the ceremonies, the rev.
anthony tremlett, the bishop of dover, england, re-hallowed st. mary's as a place of worship.
in 1992, the eagle squadrons association named st. mary's as its official chapel.
since that time, st. mary, aldermanbury has continued to serve as a focus of religious life and history.
renovated in 2006, in honor of the 60th anniversary of the "sinews of peace," the churchill museum strives to bring churchill to life for new generations born years after churchill's death.
the objective of the museum is to tell the story of churchill's life, giving due proportion both to his successes and his failures, and to let visitors make their own determinations about the man and his place in history.
this narrative is presented in the form of a "walkthrough" experience, organized chronologically.
the exhibition begins with churchill's birth and proceeds through the major events of his life, alongside an examination of the critical events of the 20th century.
the exhibit relates the story of churchill's entire life—not only his experiences in world war ii—examining his pursuits as a politician, soldier, journalist, family man, and painter.
some of the highlights of this exhibition include the "admiralty, army & arsenal: 1914–1919" room.
this portion of the exhibit is housed within a recreation of a world war i trench—complete with barbed wire, sandbags, and spent ammunition—that gives visitors a sense of a british soldier's experience on the western front.
a periscope mounted on the trench wall gives visitors a glimpse of a real world war i battlescape from period footage.
an accompanying ambient audio track plays the sound of soldiers' conversations interspersed with distant gunfire and shell bursts.
the world war i room also examines churchill's role in the disasters of the dardanelles and gallipoli and his contributions to the technology of warfare.
another highlight of the exhibition is "the gathering storm: 1929–1939" room which discusses churchill's suspicion of hitler and the nazi movement.
in this room, five video monitors play excerpts from nazi propaganda films interspersed with images of the impending war, demonstrating how nazi rhetoric differed from policy.
against this backdrop, the exhibit examines churchill's view of the nazis and his disgust for britain's pre-war appeasement politics.
yet another room, "churchill's finest hour:  world war ii, 1939–1945", portrays world war ii and churchill's pivotal role in that conflict.
here, a sound and light show replicates an air-raid on london during the "blitz".
simulated rubble surrounds the room and the room reverberates with the sounds of bombs detonating and air raid sirens sounding.
flashes of anti-aircraft fire and the prodding beams of searchlights illuminate the exhibit.
segments of war-time broadcasts add to the atmosphere.
after the conclusion of the blitz demonstration, a short film, narrated by walter cronkite, examines churchill's role as prime minister during the war.
around the walls of his room, more interactive displays describe the war-time skills of code breaking and plane spotting.
other museum highlights include "the sinews of peace" room and the "winston's wit & wisdom" room.
"the sinews of peace" tells the story of how and why churchill came to visit westminster college.
featured in this exhibit are the lectern and chair used by churchill during his speech and the ceremonial robes he wore.
in "winston's wit & wisdom" visitors sit in a simulated british club while listening to an audio presentation of churchill stories.
visitors to this room may also search through a database of churchill's most famous quotations and quips on a host of topics.
on november 9, 1990, edwina sandys, granddaughter of winston churchill, introduced her sculpture "breakthrough" to the public at the national churchill museum.
made from eight sections of the berlin wall, "breakthrough" not only serves to commemorate the fall of the berlin wall, but also to memorialize churchill's "sinews of peace."
"i had always wanted to make a sculpture for the churchill memorial at westminster," sandys said, "and this seemed the perfect moment to do something.
friends in berlin had come back with tiny little pieces of wall, and i thought, 'wouldn't it be great to make a sculpture.'
i thought i'd better go straight [to berlin] while there was some wall left."
in 1990, with the support of westminster college, sandys and her husband, richard kaplan, had traveled to east berlin to secure portions of the wall.
upon their arrival in berlin, however, the couple realized the sculpture would be costly, as 4-foot (1.2 m)-wide sections were selling for $60,000 to $200,000.
fortunately, east german officials, intrigued by the idea of an erecting a berlin wall monument at the location of churchill's 1946 speech, allowed sandys to choose eight sections of the wall as a gift to westminster college.
sandys chose the sections from an area near the brandenburg gate, frequented by artists, because of the dramatic color of the graffiti.
the repeated use of the word "unwahr" ("lies" or "untruths") within the sections also appealed to her.
sandys modified the original sections by cutting out large male and female silhouettes from the wall—these cuts outs exemplified the newly-opened communication between east and west.
when assembled, "breakthrough" proved to be an enormous sculpture, roughly 11 ft (3.4 m) high by 32 ft (9.8 m) ft long.
the silhouette cut-outs are located at the franklin d. roosevelt presidential library and museum in hyde park, new york.
one year after the fall of the berlin wall, sandys unveiled "breakthrough" before a crowd of 7,000 people gathered on the campus of westminster college.
among the gathered crowd were former president ronald reagan, senator john ashcroft, and german minister plenipotentiary fritjof von nordenskjoeld.
the dedication of "breakthrough" brought the churchill museum full-circle.
forty-four years after her grandfather had warned of the creation of the "iron curtain," edwina sandys' sculpture commemorated the close of the cold war.
winston churchill is just one of many world leaders to have visited westminster college.
since 1937, the college has played host to the john findley green lectures and the crosby kemper lectures.
both lectures have brought world-famous politicians, businessmen, and academicians to westminster college, among whom churchill was arguably the most famous lecturer and the most memorable.
the green foundation lecturesthe john findley green foundation lectures were established in 1936 as a memorial to john findley green, an attorney in st. louis who graduated from westminster in 1884.  the foundation provides for lectures designed to promote understanding of economic and social problems of international concern.
it further provides that "the speaker shall be a person of international reputation."
the kemper lectures
the crosby kemper lecture series was established in 1979 by a grant from the crosby kemper foundation of kansas city, missouri.
this foundation provides for lectures by authorities on british history and sir winston churchill at the national churchill museum.
other world leaders who have followed in churchill's footsteps and journeyed to westminster college include:  us presidents ronald reagan, gerald ford, and george h. w. bush; british prime ministers edward heath, margaret thatcher, and sir john major; polish president lech wałęsa; and soviet president mikhail gorbachev.

the kiangan national shrine (filipino: bantayog sa kiangan) also known as the yamashita shrine is a war memorial in kiangan, ifugao, philippines.
which commemorates the surrender the top commander of japanese imperial army in the philippines, general tomoyuki yamashita to the allied forces which led to the end  of the japanese occupation of the archipelago during the world war ii era.
the philippine tourism authority built a memorial in linda in the town of kiangan in ifugao province in 1974 at the site where the highest ranking imperial japanese military leader, general tomoyuki yamashita surrendered to allied forces which consisted of primarily filipino and american soldiers.
the site has been declared as a national landmark by the national historical commission.
in july 9, 1975, then-president ferdinand marcos issued proclamation no.
1460 declaring the site as a military shrine under the administration of the military memorial division of the philippine veterans affairs office (pvao), an agency under the department of national defense.
the pvao took over the operations and administration of the shrine on october 16, 1975.
the shrine monument is made of concrete and steel and its form drew inspiration from native ifugao houses.
the goddess of democracy, also known as the goddess of democracy and freedom, the spirit of democracy, and the goddess of liberty (自由女神; zìyóu nǚshén), was a 10-metre-tall (33 ft) statue created during the 1989 tiananmen square protests.
the statue was constructed over four days out of foam and papier-mâché over a metal armature.
the constructors decided to make the statue as large as possible to try to dissuade the government from dismantling it: the government would either have to destroy the statue—an action which would potentially fuel further criticism of its policies—or leave it standing.
nevertheless, the statue was destroyed on june 4, 1989, by soldiers clearing the protesters from tiananmen square.
since its destruction, numerous replicas and memorials have been erected around the world, including in hong kong, san francisco, washington, d.c., and vancouver.
near the end of may 1989 the democracy movement in tiananmen square, though still attracting huge throngs of participants, was losing momentum in the face of government inaction on reforms.
one historian said the movement "appeared to have sunk to its nadir.
the number of students in the square continued to decline.
those remaining seemed to have no clear leadership: chai ling, tired and disheartened by the difficulties of keeping the movement together, had resigned from her post...[the square] had degenerated into a shantytown, strewn with litter and permeated by the stench of garbage and overflowing portable toilets... tianamen, once a magnet pulling in huge throngs, had become only an unkempt campground of little interest to citizens, many of whom considered the struggle for democracy lost."
it was at this point that the reveal of the statue of the goddess of democracy reinvigorated the movement in the square.
the statue was built by students of the central academy of fine arts beginning on may 27 at their university.
it was built in hopes of bolstering the movement which "seemed to be losing some of its momentum; the students suspected that the government was waiting for them to tire and leave the square".
working with a sense of urgency and expedience, to create the model the larger statue would be based on the students reworked an academic exercise  built to demonstrate the effect of the distribution of weight on a piece: "a half-meter high clay sculpture of a man grasping a pole with two raised hands and leaning his weight on it."
"the students cut off the lower part of the pole and added a flame at the top to turn it into a torch; they leaned the sculpture into a more upright position;  they changed the man's face to a woman's, and otherwise added feminine characteristics to make the him into a her."
they then transferred the measurements of the model, adjusting them for the larger proportion, to the foam that once carved became the monument.
jeff widener, known for his iconic tank man photograph, took other photographs of the fateful rally, including two widely publicized images of the goddess; one under construction, and another in context of the demonstration.
while many people have noted its resemblance to the statue of liberty, a sculptor present during its construction, tsao tsing-yuan, has written that the students decided not to model their statue on the statue of liberty because they were concerned that it would be unoriginal and "too openly pro-american."
tsao further notes the influence on the statue of the work of russian sculptor vera mukhina, associated with the school of revolutionary realism.
her piece worker and kolkhoz woman was especially influential for their statue's head and facial features.
when the time came to transport the pieces of the statue to the square, the state security bureau, hearing of the students' intention, declared that any truck drivers assisting them would lose their licenses.
the students hired six beijing carts (similar to a bicycle rickshaw except with a flat cart instead of a passenger area).
four carried the statue segments, and two carried the tools required to install it.
the students had leaked a false itinerary of the move to throw off the authorities and moved the statue's three segments from the central academy of fine arts to the square by another route.
students of the other academies assisting in the construction linked arms around the carts for protection in case the authorities arrived.
at dusk on may 29, with fewer than 10,000 protesters remaining in the square the art students constructed bamboo scaffolding and then began assembling the statue.
troops called in to disrupt the movement and construction of the statue were "stalled en route by beijing residents."
by the early morning of may 30, the statue was fully assembled in tiananmen square.
it broke up the north-south axis of the square, standing between the monument to the people's heroes, and the tiananmen gate (which it faced looking at its large photograph of mao zedong).
whether the students had intended it or not "dozens of television cameras expertly framed the ironic, silent confrontation between goddess and chairman."
when the time came for the actual unveiling, on may 30, 1989, two beijing residents, a woman and a man, were chosen at random from the crowd and invited into the circle to pull the strings that would remove the pieces of red and blue cloth.
the crowd burst into cheers and shouted slogans such as "long live democracy!"
with the construction of the statue "the students, their flagging spirits revived, announced their determination to continue occupying the square."
while there had been just 10,000 people in the square on the 29th, with its unveiling "as many as 300,000 spectators flocked to the square on 30–31."
as one historian relates, "...a crudely sculpted thirty-three-foot high statue would bestow the struggle for democracy with a memorable symbol.
...it attracted thousands of spectators to the square and angered the authorities, who condemned it as an "illegal, permanent" structure that would have to be torn down."
the art students who created the statue wrote a declaration that said in part:.mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0}
at this grim moment, what we need most is to remain calm and united in a single purpose.
we need a powerful cementing force to strengthen our resolve: that is the goddess of democracy.
democracy...you are the symbol of every student in the square, of the hearts of millions of people.
...today, here in the people’s square, the people’s goddess stands tall and announces to the whole world: a consciousness of democracy has awakened among the chinese people!
the new era has begun!
...the statue of the goddess of democracy is made of plaster, and of course cannot stand here forever.
but as the symbol of the people’s hearts, she is divine and inviolate.
let those who would sully her beware: the people will not permit this!
...on the day when real democracy and freedom come to china, we must erect another goddess of democracy here in the square, monumental, towering, and permanent.
we have strong faith that that day will come at last.
we have still another hope: chinese people, arise!
erect the statue of the goddess of democracy in your millions of hearts!
long live the people!
long live freedom!
long live democracy!"
the document was signed by the eight art academies that sponsored the creation of the statue: the central academies of fine arts, arts and crafts, drama, and music; the beijing film academy; the beijing dance academy; the academy of chinese local stage arts; and the academy of traditional music.
the entire statement was written "in rather crude calligraphy" on a long banner placed near the statue, and was read in its entirety by a female student "with a good mandarin accent" from the broadcasting academy.
on june 3 even as the government troops positioned themselves to move on the students, applause erupted from the people gathered around the statue as it was announced there that a democracy university would now begin classes in the square with zhang boli appointed as its president.
even as classes began by the statue, to the west of the square and at muxidi thousands of students moved to block the oncoming 27th army who were armed with tanks, assault weapons, and bayonets.
blood was spilled by 10:30 p.m.
the soldiers were able to fulfill their timeline of reaching the square on june 4, 1989 by 1 a.m. through the use of tanks and armored personnel carriers.
the goddess of democracy had stood for only five days before being destroyed by soldiers of the people's liberation army in the assault on tiananmen that would end the democracy movement.
the toppling of the goddess of democracy was seen by millions across the world on television: “pushed by a tank, it fell forward and to the right, so that its hands and the torch struck the ground first, breaking off."
as the statue fell, protestors shouted "down with fascism!"
and "bandits!
bandits!"
it was "quickly and easily reduced to rubble, mixing with all the other rubble in the square.
to be cleared away by the army".
by 5:40 a.m. a negotiated settlement allowed the remaining students to leave by the south-eastern corner of the square.
the army had fulfilled its order to clear the square by 6:00 a.m. clashes continued throughout the city and in other towns across china.
the original statue has become an icon of liberty and a symbol of the free speech and democracy movements.
the chinese government has tried to distance itself from any discussions about the original statue or about the tiananmen square protests, and in the case of the victims of communism memorial it called the building of a replica an "attempt to defame china."
several replicas of the statue have been erected worldwide to commemorate the events of 1989:
tsao tsing-yuan, an advisor to the students who built the original, writes "i myself envision a day when another replica, as large as the original and more permanent, stands in tiananmen square, with the names of those who died there written in gold on its base.
it may  well stand there after the chairman mao's mausoleum has, in its turn, been pulled down."

man and boy is a statue situated at king's quay on the harbour of brixham, devon.
it is the result of a long fundraising effort; the residents of the town raised £76,000 for its construction.
the monument was created in clay by local sculptress elisabeth hadley and cast in bronze in shropshire.
the statue is a life-size sculpture of two fishermen, a man and a boy, behind a large ship's wheel.
a plaque situated on the statue's pedestal reads:

the charity fish (fishermen in sculptural heritage, registered charity number 1135142) was set up to raise funds for the construction of the statue.
the voluntary committee which had been drawn from local businesses, seafaring families, councillors and representatives from the fishermen's mission in torbay) began fundraising in 2008.
the kvabiskhevi church of the dormition (georgian: ქვაბისხევის ღვთისმშობლის მიძინების სახელობის ეკლესია, translit.
: kvabiskhevis ghvtismshoblis midzinebis sakhelobis ek'lesia), also known as mariamtsminda (მარიამწმინდა, mariamts'minda, "st. mary") is a medieval georgian orthodox church, situated 2 km northwest of the village of kvabiskhevi, borjomi municipality, in georgia's south-central region of samtskhe-javakheti.
a three-nave basilica, the church was constructed in the 8th or 9th century on a high rocky mountain slope, overlooking the steep descent into the deep river canyon.
the church is known for its 12th–13th-century fresco portrait of the young nobleman named shota, who is popularly believed to be the contemporaneous epic poet shota rustaveli.
the kvabiskhevi church is inscribed on the list of the immovable cultural monuments of national significance of georgia.
kvabiskhevi is a three-nave basilica built of stone on a small terrace of a high rocky mountain slope, its eastern façade leaning against the rock—the face of which had been purposefully chipped off—and the three other sides overlooking the steep abyss into the kvabiskhevi canyon.
the terrace can only be accessed via a trail from the northeast leading up to the church from the kvabiskhevi guard station of the borjomi-kharagauli national park.
difficult to access, the church served in the middle ages as a wartime shelter for the locals, whose ruined dwellings and rock-cut shelters are found below the church.
the village, at that time known as kvabi ("a cave"), was completely depopulated shortly after the ottoman takeover of the area in 1578—a turkish census of 1595 listing only six permanent residents—and the church was abandoned.
the modern-day village of kvabiskhevi, southeast of the church, is the result of resettlement from the mountainous northwestern georgian province of racha in the 1870s.
the church measures 8 x 4 sq.
m. the main nave is much larger than the lateral naves, ending in a semi-circular eastern apse with an arched window.
the conch is spherical.
the upper central portions of the northern and southern walls contain brackets.
the lower central portion of the western wall has a doorway, internally architraved and externally arched.
the main nave is separated from the other two by two arches on each side, supported by rectangular capitaled pillars.
the northern nave terminates with a semi-circular nave with windows.
the southern nave is divided into two chambers by a septum pierced by a low rectangular entrance.
most of external decorations are found on the western façade, including three bolnisi-type crosses carved in relief above the entrance door, a recurrent motif in early christian art in georgia.
the basilica contains remnants of medieval wall painting.
of note is a 12th–13th-century fresco in the northern wall of the southern nave, depicting a young man and a woman, identified by the accompanying medieval georgian asomtavruli text as shota and ia, respectively.
the fresco is reproduced in a repoussé work on the iron gate handmade in 1987. shota was not an uncommon name among the local aristocracy.
one popular hypothesis identifies the man from the kvabiskhevi fresco with the poet shota rustaveli, who penned the epic knight in the panther's skin.
the baraleti church of the theotokos (georgian: ბარალეთის ღვთისმშობლის სახელობის ეკლესია, translit.
: baraletis ghvtismshoblis sakhelobis ek'lesia) is a medieval christian church in the village of baraleti, akhalkalaki municipality, in georgia's region of samtskhe-javakheti.
the church is located in the heart of the ethnically mixed armeno-georgian village, in the historical province of javakheti.
it is a two-nave basilica, with the extant 13th-century inscription in georgian.
it is inscribed on the list of the immovable cultural monuments of national significance of georgia.
the baraleti church was built c. 1213 as suggested by a stone inscription on the eastern façade—executed in the medieval georgian asomtavruli script—which dates the construction to "the time when lasha sat [on the throne] as king", referring to george iv lasha, king of georgia.
however, the text may actually refer to reconstruction as a plan of the church is representative of an earlier period, particularly, the 11th century.
the church is a two-nave basilica built of hewn stone blocks.
the roof is covered with stone tiles.
the entrance is from the south.
each façade is pierced by a single window.
the walls contain shelf-like eaves.
the central, northern nave terminates in a semi-circular apse, surrounded with pilasters and arches.
the southern nave is lower and narrower, with a smaller semi-circular apse.
an arboured belfry was superimposed on the western edge of the church in the 19th century.
the exterior is decoration-poor, with only a now-damaged relief immured in the southern wall of the central nave, depicting daniel in the lions' den, and the 13th-century text inscribed in the eastern façade.
there are several tombstones scattered around the church.
an epitaph on one of these honors the local georgian priest petre khmaladze (1775–1856) and mentions his contribution to the defense of christianity in the area, which had been under the ottoman rule before passing into the control of the russian empire in 1829. khmaladze was canonized by the georgian orthodox church in 2015.
the monumento a giuseppe garibaldi is an equestrian sculpture featuring giuseppe garibaldi, located on plaza italia, a landmark in the palermo neighbourhood of buenos aires, argentina.
giuseppe garibaldi (1807–1882) was an italian military and political figure.
in his twenties, he joined the carbonari italian patriot revolutionaries, and had to flee italy after a failed insurrection.
he then led the italian legion in the uruguayan civil war, and afterwards returned to italy as a commander in the conflicts of the risorgimento.
he has been dubbed the "hero of the two worlds" in tribute to his military expeditions in both south america and europe.
donated to the city by italian residents, it was built by italian sculptor eugenio maccagnani as a replica of the one located in brescia, italy, and was inaugurated on june 19, 1904.

the nekresi fire temple (georgian: ნეკრესის ცეცხლის ტაძარი, translit.
: nek'resis tsetskhlis t'adzari) is an archaeological complex in the eastern georgian region of kakheti, part of the wider nekresi site.
the excavated building, preserved only fragmentarily at a foundation level, is identified as a zoroastrian fire temple, sun temple, or a manichean shrine.
constructed in the 2nd or 3rd century, the complex was destroyed in the 5th.
the site is inscribed on the list of the immovable cultural monuments of national significance of georgia.
the nekresi temple lies in lowland arable fields to the south of the hill on which the early medieval nekresi monastery stands.
it was unearthed by an archaeological expedition from the georgian national museum working at nekresi between 1984 and 1993 and identified by its excavator, levan chilashvili, as a zoroastrian fire-temple.
in 2004, another team suggested that the temple was aligned with the summer and winter solstices and it might have incorporated elements of solar worship.
alternatively, guram kipiani argues that the spatial organization of the building is not compatible with that of a fire-temple and theorizes that the complex was in fact a manichean shrine.
archaeological artifacts found at the site are limited to fragments of pottery of the 2nd to the 4th centuries; charcoal from a threshold gave a radiocarbon date in the 5th century suggesting that the site was destroyed at that time.
two construction phases are identified in the complex; the lower horizon is a ground floor and foundation of a cult building, dated to the period of the 2nd–4th century, which seems to have been deliberately demolished and parts of its building materials reused for the construction of a castle or fortified palace.
both layers are built of large rubble with lime mortar with the additional use of flat bricks in the upper layer.
the temple is set in a square plan, measuring 50 x 50 metres in total.
its design is complex, centered on an almost square building of 76 m², around which there were four more buildings arranged in a cruciform pattern and each ending in a semicircular apse facing the central building.
in the southwestern corner of the central building was a nearly square area made of clay, measuring 4.5 m² and containing traces of fire, leading to the conclusion that the edifice was a fire-temple.
all five buildings together with their associated corridors and accessory chambers were enclosed by a wall.
access to any of the rooms in the complex was possible through doors cut in the external corridors.
chabukauri basilica (georgian: ჭაბუკაურის ბაზილიკა, translit.
: ch'abuk'auris bazilik'a) is an early christian church—now in a ruinous state—in the eastern georgian region of kakheti, in the territory of the historical settlement of nekresi, about 1.5 km northwest of the nekresi monastic complex.
it is a large three-aisle basilica, dated to the 4th to 5th century, making it one of the earliest christian church buildings in georgia.
it was unearthed in 1998. the basilica is inscribed on the list of the immovable cultural monuments of national significance of georgia.
the chabukauri basilica was unearthed in an eponymous plot in 1998 and was dated, on architectural and archaeological grounds, to the 4th or 5th century.
being one of the largest basilican churches in georgia, its discovery questioned a previous assumption that the first church buildings in eastern georgia were typically small narrow edifices autonomously developed in the country.
another huge basilica, the dolochopi church, was uncovered just 4 km east as the crow flies, in 2012. both temples appear to have been part of the larger settlement of nekresi, but due to the lack of written sources and dense foliage covering the area its extent remains unknown.
these christian establishments were founded not long after as a nearby located zoroastrian shrine, the so-called nekresi fire temple, was abandoned.
nodar bakhtadze, who excavated chabukauri, identifies the basilica with a church known from the early medieval georgian chronicles to have been founded at nekresi by king trdat of kartli (r. c. 394 – 406).
the church's design is in line with the established eastern roman standards, but the architectural details such as a quadrangular sanctuary and parabemata show affinities with the early churches in sasanian iran, such as hira, ain shaia, and kharg, all dated to the late 4th century.
chabukauri is a three-nave basilica, measuring 33.4 x 15 m. it was built of large limestone blocks, sledged stones, and gravel.
the naos is divided into three naves by five pairs of rectangular-shaped pillars.
a rectangular altar seems to have been placed in the southeast of the main nave.
it was flanked, on either side, by small rectangular chambers, corresponding to the pastophoria.
the building had three entrances, on the south, west, and north.
the main nave appears to have been damaged in an earthquake not long after the church's construction and part of its northeastern sector was converted into the south aisle of a new, smaller building.
this new church terminated in two distinctive horseshoe-shaped apses, the larger of which had a synthronon.
the church had a wooden roof with ceramic tiles, held in place with nails and antefixes.
a number of medieval cist burials have been unearthed across the site.
within the church ruins, many fragments of pottery and two unique bronze oil lamps have been found.
to the northwest of the basilica there is a small apsed structure of unknown function, which was covered by a high-quality terracotta tile floor.
there is an indication that the walls of the building were once plastered and painted red.
the air force monument is an outdoor memorial and sculpture by leonard mcmurry, installed in oklahoma city, in the u.s. state of oklahoma.
the 12-foot (3.7 m) monument was completed in 1964, then restored in 2002 and rededicated in 2003. it depicts a man holding the united states air force seal and an eagle above his head.
the memorial is dedicated "to the memory of those oklahomans who have given their lives while serving their country as members of the united states air force and for the working men and women at tinker air force base, both military and civilian, who have and continue to give of themselves for the defense of the homeland we so dearly love".
isabella i (spanish: isabel i, 22 april 1451 – 26 november 1504) was queen of castile from 1474 and queen consort of aragon from 1479, reigning over a dynastically unified spain jointly with her husband ferdinand ii.
after a struggle to claim her right to the throne, she reorganized the governmental system, brought the crime rate to the lowest it had been in years, and unburdened the kingdom of the enormous debt her brother had left behind.
isabella's marriage to ferdinand in 1469 created the basis of the de facto unification of spain.
her reforms and those she made with her husband had an influence that extended well beyond the borders of their united kingdoms.
isabella and ferdinand are known for completing the reconquista, ordering conversion or exile to their jewish and muslim subjects, and for supporting and financing christopher columbus's 1492 voyage that led to the opening of the new world and to the establishment of spain as a major power in europe and much of the world for more than a century.
isabella, granted together with her husband the title "the catholic"  by pope alexander vi, was recognized as a servant of god by the catholic church in 1974.
isabella was born in madrigal de las altas torres, ávila, to john ii of castile and his second wife, isabella of portugal on 22 april 1451.   at the time of her birth, she was second in line to the throne after her older half-brother henry iv of castile.
henry was 26 at that time and married, but childless.
her younger brother alfonso of castile was born two years later on 17 november 1453, lowering her position to third in line.
when her father died in 1454, her half-brother ascended to the throne as king henry iv of castile.
isabella and her brother alfonso were left in king henry's care.
she, her mother, and alfonso then moved to arévalo.
these were times of turmoil for isabella.
the living conditions at their castle in arévalo were poor, and they suffered from a shortage of money.
although her father arranged in his will for his children to be financially well taken care of, king henry did not comply with their father's wishes, either from a desire to keep his half-siblings restricted, or from ineptitude.
even though living conditions were difficult, under the careful eye of her mother, isabella was instructed in lessons of practical piety and in a deep reverence for religion.
when the king's wife, joan of portugal, was about to give birth to their daughter joanna, isabella and her brother alfonso were summoned to court in segovia to come under the direct supervision of the king and to finish their education.
alfonso was placed in the care of a tutor while isabella became part of the queen's household.
some of isabella's living conditions improved in segovia.
she always had food and clothing and lived in a castle that was adorned with gold and silver.
isabella's basic education consisted of reading, spelling, writing, grammar, history, mathematics, art, chess, dancing, embroidery, music, and religious instruction.
she and her ladies-in-waiting entertained themselves with art, embroidery, and music.
she lived a relaxed lifestyle, but she rarely left segovia since king henry forbade this.
her half-brother was keeping her from the political turmoils going on in the kingdom, though isabella had full knowledge of what was going on and of her role in the feuds.
[citation needed]
the noblemen, anxious for power, confronted king henry, demanding that his younger half-brother infante alfonso be named his successor.
they even went so far as to ask alfonso to seize the throne.
the nobles, now in control of alfonso and claiming that he was the true heir, clashed with king henry's forces at the second battle of olmedo in 1467. the battle was a draw.
king henry agreed to recognize alfonso as his heir presumptive, provided that he would marry his daughter, princess joanna la beltraneja.
soon after he was named prince of asturias, isabella's younger brother alfonso died in july 1468, likely of the plague.
the nobles who had supported him suspected poisoning.
as she had been named in her brother's will as his successor, the nobles asked isabella to take his place as champion of the rebellion.
however, support for the rebels had begun to wane, and isabella preferred a negotiated settlement to continuing the war.
she met with her elder brother henry at toros de guisando and they reached a compromise: the war would stop, king henry would name isabella his heir-presumptive instead of his daughter joanna, and isabella would not marry without her brother's consent, but he would not be able to force her to marry against her will.
isabella's side came out with most of what the nobles desired, though they did not go so far as to officially depose king henry; they were not powerful enough to do so, and isabella did not want to jeopardize the principle of fair inherited succession, since it was upon this idea that she had based her argument for legitimacy as heir-presumptive.
the question of isabella's marriage was not a new one.
she had made her debut in the matrimonial market at the age of six with a betrothal to ferdinand, the younger son of john ii of navarre (whose family was a cadet branch of the house of trastámara).
at that time, the two kings, henry and john, were eager to show their mutual love and confidence and they believed that this double alliance would make their eternal friendship obvious to the world.
this arrangement, however, did not last long.
ferdinand's uncle alfonso v of aragon died in 1458. all of alfonso's spanish territories, as well as the islands of sicily and sardinia, were left to his brother john ii.
john now had a stronger position than ever before and no longer needed the security of henry's friendship.
henry was now in need of a new alliance.
he saw the chance for this much needed new friendship in charles of viana, john's elder son.
charles was constantly at odds with his father, and because of this, he secretly entered into an alliance with henry iv of castile.
a major part of the alliance was that a marriage was to be arranged between charles and isabella.
when john ii learned of this arranged marriage he was outraged.
isabella had been intended for his favourite younger son, ferdinand, and in his eyes this alliance was still valid.
john ii had his son charles thrown in prison on charges of plotting against his father's life; charles died in 1461.
in 1465, an attempt was made to marry isabella to alfonso v of portugal, henry's brother-in-law.
through the medium of the queen and count of ledesma, a portuguese alliance was made.
isabella, however, was wary of the marriage and refused to consent.
a civil war broke out in castile over king henry's inability to act as sovereign.
henry now needed a quick way to please the rebels of the kingdom.
as part of an agreement to restore peace, isabella was to be betrothed to pedro girón acuña pacheco, master of the order of calatrava and brother to the king's favourite, juan pacheco.
in return, don pedro would pay into the impoverished royal treasury an enormous sum of money.
seeing no alternative, henry agreed to the marriage.
isabella was aghast and prayed to god that the marriage would not come to pass.
her prayers were answered when don pedro suddenly fell ill and died while on his way to meet his fiancée.
when henry had recognised isabella as his heir-presumptive on 19 september 1468, he had also promised that his sister should not be compelled to marry against her will, while she in return had agreed to obtain his consent.
it seemed that finally the years of failed attempts at political marriages were over.
there was talk of a marriage to edward iv of england or to one of his brothers, probably richard, duke of gloucester, but this alliance was never seriously considered.
once again in 1468, a marriage proposal arrived from alfonso v of portugal.
going against his promises made in september, henry tried to make the marriage a reality.
if isabella married alfonso, henry's daughter joanna would marry alfonso's son john ii and thus, after the death of the old king, john and joanna could inherit portugal and castile.
isabella refused and made a secret promise to marry her cousin and very first betrothed, ferdinand of aragon.
after this failed attempt, henry once again went against his promises and tried to marry isabella to louis xi's brother charles, duke of berry.
in henry's eyes, this alliance would cement the friendship of castile and france as well as remove isabella from castilian affairs.
isabella once again refused the proposal.
meanwhile, john ii of aragon negotiated in secret with isabella a wedding to his son ferdinand.
on 18 october 1469, the formal betrothal took place.
because isabella and ferdinand were second cousins, they stood within the prohibited degrees of consanguinity and the marriage would not be legal unless a dispensation from the pope was obtained.
with the help of the valencian cardinal rodrigo borgia (later alexander vi), isabella and ferdinand were presented with a supposed papal bull by pius ii (who had died in 1464), authorising ferdinand to marry within the third degree of consanguinity, making their marriage legal.
afraid of opposition, isabella eloped from the court of henry with the excuse of visiting her brother alfonso's tomb in ávila.
ferdinand, on the other hand, crossed castile in secret disguised as a servant.
they were married immediately upon reuniting, on 19 october 1469, in the palacio de los vivero in the city of valladolid.
on 12 december 1474, news of isabella's brother king henry iv's death in madrid reached segovia prompting isabella to take refuge within the walls of the alcázar of segovia where she received the support of andres de cabrera and segovia's council.
the next day, isabella was proclaimed queen of castile and león.
isabella's reign got off to a rocky start.
because her brother had named isabella as his successor, when she ascended to the throne in 1474, there were already several plots against her.
diego pacheco, the marquis of villena, and his followers maintained that joanna la beltraneja, daughter of king henry iv, was the rightful queen.
shortly after the marquis made his claim, a longtime supporter of isabella, the archbishop of toledo, left court to plot with his great-nephew the marquis.
the archbishop and marquis made plans to have joanna marry her uncle king alfonso v of portugal and invade castile to claim the throne for themselves.
in may 1475, king alfonso and his army crossed into spain and advanced to plasencia.
here he married the young joanna.
a long and bloody war for the castilian succession then took place.
the war went back and forth for almost a year until 1 march 1476, when the battle of toro took place, a battle in which both sides claimed victory and celebrated the victory: the troops of king alfonso v were beaten by the castilian centre-left commanded by the duke of alba and cardinal mendoza while the forces led by john of portugal defeated the castilian right wing and remained in possession of the battlefield.
but despite its uncertain outcome, the battle of toro represented a great political victory for the catholic monarchs, assuring them the throne since the supporters of joanna la beltraneja disbanded and the portuguese army, without allies, left castile.as summarised by the historian justo l. gonzález:
both armies faced each other at the camps of toro resulting in an indecisive battle.
but while the portuguese king reorganised his troops, ferdinand sent news to all the cities of castile and to several foreign kingdoms informing them about a huge victory where the portuguese were crushed.
faced with these news, the party of "la beltraneja" [joanna] was dissolved and the portuguese were forced to return to their kingdom.
with great political vision, isabella took advantage of the moment and convoked courts at madrigal-segovia (april–october 1476) where her eldest child and daughter isabella was first sworn as heiress to castile's crown.
that was equivalent to legitimising isabella's own throne.
in august of the same year, isabella proved her abilities as a powerful ruler on her own.
a rebellion broke out in segovia, and isabella rode out to suppress it, as her husband ferdinand was off fighting at the time.
going against the advice of her male advisors, isabella rode by herself into the city to negotiate with the rebels.
she was successful and the rebellion was quickly brought to an end.
two years later, isabella further secured her place as ruler with the birth of her son john, prince of asturias, on 30 june 1478. to many, the presence of a male heir legitimised her place as ruler.
meanwhile, the castilian and portuguese fleets fought for hegemony in the atlantic ocean and for the wealth of guinea (gold and slaves), where the decisive naval battle of guinea was fought.
the war dragged on for another three years and ended with a castilian victory on land and a portuguese victory on the sea.
the four separate peace treaties signed at alcáçovas (4 september 1479) reflected that result: portugal gave up the throne of castile in favour of isabella in exchange for a very favourable share of the atlantic territories disputed with castile (they all went to portugal with the exception of the canary islands: guinea with its mines of gold, cape verde, madeira, azores, and the right of conquest over the kingdom of fez) plus a large war compensation: 106.676 dobles of gold.
the catholic monarchs also had to accept that joanna la beltraneja remain in portugal instead of spain and to pardon all rebellious subjects who had supported joanna and king alfonso.
and the catholic monarchs—who had proclaimed themselves rulers of portugal and donated lands to noblemen inside this country—had to give up the portuguese crown.
at alcáçovas, isabella and ferdinand had conquered the throne, but the portuguese exclusive right of navigation and commerce in all of the atlantic ocean south of the canary islands meant that spain was practically blocked out of the atlantic and was deprived of the gold of guinea, which induced anger in andalusia.
spanish academic antonio rumeu de armas claims that with the peace treaty of alcáçovas in 1479, the catholic monarchs "...buy the peace at an excessively expensive price..." and historian mª monserrat león guerrero added that they "...find themselves forced to abandon their expansion by the atlantic...".
christopher columbus freed castile from this difficult situation, because his new world discovery led to a new and much more balanced sharing of the atlantic at tordesillas in 1494. as the orders received by columbus in his first voyage (1492) show: "[the catholic monarchs] have always in mind that the limits signed in the share of alcáçovas should not be overcome, and thus they insist with columbus to sail along the parallel of canary."
thus, by sponsoring the columbian adventure to the west, the spanish monarchs were trying the only remaining path of expansion.
as is now known, they would be extremely successful on this issue.
isabella had proven herself to be a fighter and tough monarch from the start.
now that she had succeeded in securing her place on the castilian throne, she could begin to institute the reforms that the kingdom desperately needed.
when isabella came to the throne in 1474, castile was in a state of despair due to her brother henry's reign.
it was not unknown that henry iv was a big spender and did little to enforce the laws of his kingdom.
it was even said by one castilian denizen of the time that murder, rape, and robbery happened without punishment.
because of this, isabella needed desperately to find a way to reform her kingdom.
due to the measures imposed, historians during her lifetime saw her to be more inclined to justice than to mercy, and indeed far more rigorous and unforgiving than her husband ferdinand.
isabella's first major reform came during the cortes of madrigal in 1476 in the form of a police force, la santa hermandad (the holy brotherhood).
while 1476 was not the first time that castile had seen the hermandad, it was the first time that the police force was used by the crown.
during the late medieval period, the expression hermandad had been used to describe groups of men who came together of their own accord to regulate law and order by patrolling the roads and countryside and punishing malefactors.
these brotherhoods had usually been suppressed by the monarch, however.before 1476, the justice system in most parts of the country was effectively under the control of dissident members of the nobility rather than royal officials.
to fix this problem, during 1476, a general hermandad was established for castile, leon, and asturias.
the police force was to be made up of locals who were to regulate the crime occurring in the kingdom.
it was to be paid for by a tax of 1800 maravedís on every one hundred households.
in 1477, isabella visited extremadura and andalusia to introduce this more efficient police force there as well.
keeping with her reformation of the regulation of laws, in 1481 isabella charged two officials with restoring peace in galicia.
this turbulent province had been the prey of tyrant nobles since the days of isabella's father, john ii.
robbers infested the highways and oppressed the smaller towns and villages.
these officials set off with the herculean task of restoring peace for the province.
the officials were successful.
they succeeded in driving over 1,500 robbers from galicia.
from the very beginning of her reign, isabella fully grasped the importance of restoring the crown's finances.
the reign of henry iv had left the kingdom of castile in great debt.
upon examination, it was found that the chief cause of the nation's poverty was the wholesale alienation of royal estates during henry's reign.
to make money, henry had sold off royal estates at prices well below their value.
the cortes of toledo of 1480 came to the conclusion that the only hope of lasting financial reform lay in a resumption of these alienated lands and rents.
this decision was warmly approved by many leading nobles of the court, but isabella was reluctant to take such drastic measures.
it was decided that the cardinal of spain would hold an enquiry into the tenure of estates and rents acquired during henry iv's reign.
those that had not been granted as a reward for services were to be restored without compensation, while those that had been sold at a price far below their real value were to be bought back at the same sum.
while many of the nobility were forced to pay large sums of money for their estates, the royal treasury became even richer.
isabella's one stipulation was that there would be no revocation of gifts made to churches, hospitals, or the poor.
another issue of money was the overproduction of coinage and the abundance of mints in the kingdom.
during henry's reign, the number of mints regularly producing money had increased from just five to 150. much of the coinage produced in these mints was nearly worthless.
during the first year of her reign, isabella established a monopoly over the royal mints and fixed a legal standard to which the coinage had to approximate[citation needed].
by shutting down many of the mints and taking royal control over the production of money, isabella restored the confidence of the public in the crown's ability to handle the kingdom's finances.
both isabella and ferdinand established very few new governmental and administrative institutions in their respective kingdoms.
especially in castile, the main achievement was to use more effectively the institutions that had existed during the reigns of john ii and henry iv.
historically, the center of the castilian government had been the royal household, together with its surrounding court.
the household was traditionally divided into two overlapping bodies.
the first body was made up of household officials, mainly people of the nobility, who carried out governmental and political functions for which they received special payment.
the second body was made up of some 200 permanent servants or continos who performed a wide range of confidential functions on behalf of the rulers.
by the 1470s, when isabella began to take a firm grip on the royal administration, the senior offices of the royal household were simply honorary titles and held strictly by the nobility.
the positions of a more secretarial nature were often held by senior churchmen.
substantial revenues were attached to such offices and were therefore enjoyed greatly, on an effectively hereditary basis, by the great castilian houses of nobility.
while the nobles held the titles, individuals of lesser breeding did the real work.
traditionally, the main advisory body to the rulers of castile was the royal council.
the council, under the monarch, had full power to resolve all legal and political disputes.
the council was responsible for supervising all senior administrative officials, such as the crown representatives in all of the major towns.
it was also the supreme judicial tribunal of the kingdom.
in 1480, during the cortes of toledo, isabella made many reforms to the royal council.
previously there had been two distinct yet overlapping categories of royal councillor.
one formed a group which possessed both judicial and administrative responsibilities.
this portion consisted of some bishops, some nobles, and an increasingly important element of professional administrators with legal training known as letrados.
the second category of traditional councillor had a less formal role.
this role depended greatly on the individuals' political influence and personal influence with the monarch.
during isabella's reign, the role of this second category was completely eliminated.
as mentioned previously, isabella had little care for personal bribes or favours.
because of this, this second type of councillor, usually of the nobility, was only allowed to attend the council of castile as an observer.
isabella began to rely more on the professional administrators than ever before.
these men were mostly of the bourgeoisie or lesser nobility.
the council was also rearranged and it was officially settled that one bishop, three caballeros, and eight or nine lawyers would serve on the council at a time.
while the nobles were no longer directly involved in the matters of state, they were welcome to attend the meetings.
isabella hoped by forcing the nobility to choose whether to participate or not would weed out those who were not dedicated to the state and its cause.
isabella also saw the need to provide a personal relationship between herself as the monarch and her subjects.
therefore, isabella and ferdinand set aside a time every friday during which they themselves would sit and allow people to come to them with complaints.
this was a new form of personal justice that castile had not seen before.
the council of state was reformed and presided over by the king and queen.
this department of public affairs dealt mainly with foreign negotiations, hearing embassies, and transacting business with the court of rome.
in addition to these departments, there was also a supreme court of the santa hermandad, a council of finance, and a council for settling purely aragonese matters.
although isabella made many reforms that seem to have made the cortes stronger, in actuality the cortes lost political power during the reigns of isabella and ferdinand.
isabella and her husband moved in the direction of a non-parliamentary government and the cortes became an almost passive advisory body, giving automatic assent to legislation which had been drafted by the royal administration.
after the reforms of the cortes of toledo, the queen ordered a noted jurist, alfonso diaz de montalvo, to undertake the task of clearing away legal rubbish and compiling what remained into a comprehensive code.
within four years the work stood completed in eight bulky volumes and the ordenanzas reales took their place on legal bookshelves.
at the end of the reconquista, only granada was left for isabella and ferdinand to conquer.
the emirate of granada had been held by the muslim nasrid dynasty since the mid-13th century.
protected by natural barriers and fortified towns, it had withstood the long process of the reconquista.
on 1 february 1482, the king and queen reached medina del campo and this is generally considered the beginning of the war for granada.
while isabella's and ferdinand's involvement in the war was apparent from the start, granada's leadership was divided and never able to present a united front.
it still took ten years to conquer granada, however, culminating in 1492.
the spanish monarchs recruited soldiers from many european countries and improved their artillery with the latest and best cannons.
systematically, they proceeded to take the kingdom piece by piece.
in 1485 they laid siege to ronda, which surrendered after only a fortnight due to extensive bombardment.
the following year, loja was taken, and again muhammad xii was captured and released.
one year later, with the fall of málaga, the western part of the muslim nasrid kingdom had fallen into spanish hands.
the eastern province succumbed after the fall of baza in 1489. the siege of granada began in the spring of 1491 and at the end of the year, muhammad xii surrendered.
on 2 january 1492 isabella and ferdinand entered granada to receive the keys of the city, and the principal mosque was reconsecrated as a church.
the treaty of granada was signed later that year, and in it ferdinand and isabella gave their word to allow the muslims and jews of granada to live in peace.
during the war, isabella noted the abilities and energy of gonzalo fernández de córdoba and made him one of the two commissioners for the negotiations.
under her patronage, de córdoba went on to an extraordinary military career that revolutionised the organisation and tactics of the emerging spanish military, changing the nature of warfare and altering the european balance of power.
just three months after entering granada, queen isabella agreed to sponsor christopher columbus on an expedition to reach the indies by sailing west (2000 miles, according to columbus).
the crown agreed to pay a sum of money as a concession from monarch to subject.
his expedition departed on 3 august 1492, and arrived in san salvador island on 12 october.
he named it san salvador after jesus the savior.
he returned the next year and presented his findings to the monarchs, bringing natives and gold under a hero's welcome.
although columbus was sponsored by the castilian queen, treasury accounts show no royal payments to him until 1493, after his first voyage was complete.
spain entered a golden age of exploration and colonisation, the period of the spanish empire.
in 1494, by the treaty of tordesillas, isabella and ferdinand agreed to divide the earth, outside of europe, with king john ii of portugal.
the portuguese did not recognise that south america belonged to the spanish because it was in portugal's sphere of influence, and the portuguese king john ii threatened to send an army to claim the land for the portuguese.
isabella was not in favour of columbus' enslavement of the american natives and attempted to enforce the recent policies of the canaries upon the 'new world', stating that all peoples were under the subject of the castilian crown and could not be enslaved in most situations.
the principles she established would have very little effect during her lifetime, however.
with the institution of the roman catholic inquisition in spain, and with the dominican friar tomás de torquemada as the first inquisitor general, the catholic monarchs pursued a policy of religious and national unity.
though isabella opposed taking harsh measures against jews on economic grounds, torquemada was able to convince ferdinand.
[citation needed] on 31 march 1492, the alhambra decree for the expulsion of the jews was issued.
the jews had until the end of july, four months, to leave the country and they were not to take with them gold, silver, money, arms, or horses.
traditionally, it had been claimed that as many as 200,000 jews left spain, but recent historians have shown that such figures are exaggerated: henry kamen has shown that out of a total population of 80,000 jews, a maximum of 40,000 left and the rest converted.
hundreds of those that remained came under the inquisition's investigations into relapsed conversos (marranos) and the judaizers who had been abetting them.
isabella received the title of catholic monarch by pope alexander vi, whose behavior and involvement in matters isabella did not approve of.
[citation needed] along with the physical unification of spain, isabella and ferdinand embarked on a process of spiritual unification, trying to bring the country under one faith (roman catholicism).
as part of this process, the inquisition became institutionalised.
after a muslim uprising in 1499, and further troubles thereafter, the treaty of granada was broken in 1502, and muslims were ordered to either become christians or to leave.
isabella's confessor, cisneros, was named archbishop of toledo.
he was instrumental in a program of rehabilitation of the religious institutions of spain, laying the groundwork for the later counter-reformation.
as chancellor, he exerted more and more power.
isabella and her husband had created an empire and in later years were consumed with administration and politics; they were concerned with the succession and worked to link the spanish crown to the other rulers in europe.
by early 1497, all the pieces seemed to be in place: the son and heir john, prince of asturias, married a habsburg princess, margaret of austria, establishing the connection to the habsburgs.
the eldest daughter, isabella of aragon, married king manuel i of portugal, and the younger daughter, joanna of castile, was married to a habsburg prince, philip i of habsburg.
in 1500 isabella granted all non-rebellious natives in the colonies citizenship and full legal freedom by decree.
however, isabella's plans for her eldest two children did not work out.
her only son, john of asturias, died shortly after his marriage.
her daughter isabella of aragon, whose son miguel da paz died at the age of two, died in childbirth.
queen isabella i's crowns passed to her third child joanna and her son-in-law, philip i.
isabella did, however, make successful dynastic matches for her two youngest daughters.
the death of isabella of aragon created a necessity for manuel i of portugal to remarry, and isabella's third daughter, maria of aragon, became his next bride.
isabella's youngest daughter, catherine of aragon, married england's arthur, prince of wales, but his early death resulted in her being married to his younger brother, king henry viii of england.
isabella officially withdrew from governmental affairs on 14 september 1504 and she died that same year on 26 november at the medina del campo royal palace.
she had already been in decline since the deaths of her son prince john of asturias in 1497, her mother isabella of portugal in 1496, and her daughter princess isabella of asturias in 1498. she is entombed in granada in the capilla real, which was built by her grandson, charles v, holy roman emperor (carlos i of spain), alongside her husband ferdinand, her daughter joanna and joanna's husband philip i; and isabella's 2-year-old grandson, miguel da paz (the son of isabella's daughter, also named isabella, and king manuel i of portugal).
the museum next to the capilla real holds her crown and scepter.
isabella was short but of strong stocky build, of a very fair complexion, and had a hair color that was between strawberry-blonde and auburn.
some portraits, however, show her as a brunette.
her daughters, joanna and catherine, were thought to resemble her the most.
isabella maintained an austere, temperate lifestyle, and her religious spirit influenced her the most in life.
in spite of her hostility towards the muslims in andalusia, isabella developed a taste for moorish decor and style.
of her, contemporaries said:
isabella and ferdinand had seven children, five of whom survived to adulthood:
towards the end of her life, family tragedies overwhelmed her, although she met these reverses with grace and fortitude[citation needed].
the death of her beloved son and heir and the miscarriage of his wife, the death of her daughter isabella and isabella's son miguel (who could have united the kingdoms of the catholic monarchs with that of portugal), the rebellion and alleged madness of her daughter joanna and the indifference of philip the handsome, and the uncertainty catherine was in after the death of her husband submerged her in profound sadness that made her dress in black for the rest of her lifetime[citation needed].
her strong spirituality is well understood from the words she said after hearing of her son's death: "the lord gave him to me, the lord hath taken him from me, glory be his holy name.
"[citation needed]
in 1958, the catholic canonical process of the cause of canonization of isabella was started by josé garcía goldaraz, the bishop of valladolid, where she died in 1504.
17 experts were appointed to investigate more than 100,000 documents in the archives of spain and the vatican and the merits of opening a canonical process of canonisation.
3,500 of these were chosen to be included in 27 volumes.
in 1970, the commission determined that "a canonical process for the canonization of isabella the catholic could be undertaken with a sense of security since there was not found one single act, public or private, of queen isabella that was not inspired by christian and evangelical criteria; moreover there was a 'reputation of sanctity' uninterrupted for five centuries and as the investigation was progressing, it was more accentuated."
in 1972, the process of valladolid was officially submitted to the congregation for the causes of saints in the vatican.
this process was approved and isabel was given the title "servant of god" in march 1974.
some authors have claimed that isabella's reputation for sanctity derives in large measure from an image carefully shaped and disseminated by the queen herself.
as princess of asturias, isabella bore the undifferenced royal arms of the crown of castile and added the saint john the evangelist's eagle, an eagle displayed as single supporter.
as queen, she quartered the royal arms of the crown of castile with the royal arms of the crown of aragon, she and ferdinand ii of aragon adopted a yoke and a bundle of arrows as heraldic badges.
as co-monarchs, isabella and ferdinand used the motto "tanto monta" ("they amount to the same", or "equal opposites in balance"), it refers their prenuptial agreement.
the conquest of granada in 1492 was symbolised by the addition enté en point of a quarter with a pomegranate for granada (in spanish granada means pomegranate).
there was an uncommon variant with the saint john the evangelist's eagle and two lions adopted as castilian royal supporters by john ii, isabella's father.

isabella is most remembered for enabling columbus' voyage to the new world, which began an era for greatness for spain and europe.
in particular her reign saw the founding of the spanish empire.
this in turn ultimately led to establishment of the modern nations of the americas, in addition to the decimation of the pre-columbian nations of the americas.
she and her husband completed the reconquista, driving out the most significant muslim influence in western europe and firmly establishing spain and the iberian peninsula as staunchly catholic.
her reign also established the spanish inquisition.
the spanish crown created the order of isabella the catholic in 1815 in honor of the queen.
isabella was the first woman to be featured on us postage stamps, namely on three stamps of the columbian issue, also in celebration of columbus.
she appears in the 'columbus soliciting aid of isabella', 5-cent issue, and on the spanish court scene replicated on the 15-cent columbian, and on the $4 issue, in full portrait, side by side with columbus.
the $4 stamp is the only stamp of that denomination ever issued and one which collectors prize not only for its rarity (only 30,000 were printed) but its beauty, an exquisite carmine with some copies having a crimson hue.
mint specimens of this commemorative have been sold for more than $20,000.
isabella was also the first named woman to appear on a united states coin, the 1893 commemorative isabella quarter, celebrating the 400th anniversary of columbus's first voyage.

baithak or bethak, lit.
seat, is a site considered sacred by the followers of the pushtimarg tradition of vaishnava hinduism in india for performing devotional rituals.
these sites are associated with vallabhacharya mahaprabhu, the founder of pushtimarg and his descendants.
they mark public events in their lives.
some of them are restricted or foreboding.
these sites are spread across india and are chiefly concentrated in braj region in uttar pradesh and in western state of gujarat.
total 142 baithaks are considered sacred; 84 of vallabhacharya, 28 of his son viththalanath gusainji and 30 of his seven grandsons.
vallabhacharya mahaprabhu was the founder of pushtimarg who lived in 15th century.
from the young age, he travelled and visited pilgrimage sites across india.
he recited and gave discourses on sacred scriptures like vedas, ramayana and bhagavata at these sites.
the locations for recitation were usually banks of the rivers or lakes and quite groves in outskirt of towns.
he recited original texts from scriptures as well as gave commentaries on them.
later these commentaries were compiled in anubhashya and subodhini.
these are 84 sites where vallabhacharya gave discourses which are known as baithaks.
later small shrines are built to commemorate the event at some sites.
some sites do not have shrines or temples to mark the place but they are known only through stories and texts.
at these shrines, the hand-written manuscripts and personal artifacts of vallabhacharya are housed which are revered by the followers.
they generally don't house images.
personal use products like clothes and ornaments are offered by the followers.
only water and sugar crystals are offered as vallabhacharya used to fast during sacred recitals.
they too follow seven darshan schedule followed in vaishnava haveli temples.
his descendants also gave discourses at various places and established their baithaks.
these 84 baithaks are located from rameshwaram at the southern tip of india to badrinath in the north, and from narayan sarovar and bet dwarka in west to puri in the east.
baithaks are also located at the places associated with his life such as at tirumala tirupati, the family's tutelary deity; champaran, his birthplace; varanasi where he spent significant part of his life.
baithaks are also located in the regions highly associated with krishna such as in braj region (now roughly corresponding to mathura district of uttar pradesh) and in dwarka in gujarat.
many baithaks of vallabhkula, the descendants of the vallabhacharya are at the sites of baithaks of vallabhacharya.
this baithaks are sanctified by viththalnath gusainji and his seven sons.
28 baithaks are associated with gusainji viththalnath while 30 more baithaks are associated with his seven sons.

stepwells are wells or ponds in which the water is reached by descending a set of steps to the water level.
they may be multi-storied with a bullock turning a water wheel to raise the well water to the first or second floor.
they are most common in western india and are also found in the other more arid regions of the indian subcontinent, extending into pakistan.
the construction of stepwells is mainly utilitarian, though they may include embellishments of architectural significance, and be temple tanks.
stepwells are examples of the many types of storage and irrigation tanks that were developed in india, mainly to cope with seasonal fluctuations in water availability.
a basic difference between stepwells on the one hand, and tanks and wells on the other, is to make it easier for people to reach the groundwater and to maintain and manage the well.
the builders dug deep trenches into the earth for dependable, year-round groundwater.
they lined the walls of these trenches with blocks of stone, without mortar, and created stairs leading down to the water.
the majority of surviving stepwells originally served a leisure purpose as well as providing water.
this was because the base of the well provided relief from the daytime heat, and this was increased if the well was covered.
stepwells also served as a place for social gatherings and religious ceremonies.
usually, women were more associated with these wells because they were the ones who collected the water.
also, it was they who prayed and offered gifts to the goddess of the well for her blessings.
this led to the building of some significant ornamental and architectural features, often associated with dwellings and in urban areas.
it also ensured their survival as monuments.
stepwells usually consist of two parts: a vertical shaft from which water is drawn and the surrounding inclined subterranean passageways, chambers and steps which provide access to the well.
the galleries and chambers surrounding these wells were often carved profusely with elaborate detail and became cool, quiet retreats during the hot summers.
a number of distinct names, sometimes local, exist for stepwells.
in hindi-speaking regions, they include names based on baudi (including bawdi (rajasthani: बावड़ी), bawri, baoli, bavadi, and bavdi).
in gujarati and marwari language, they are usually called vav or vaav (gujarati: વાવ).
other names include kalyani or pushkarani (kannada), baoli (hindi: बावली) and barav (marathi: बारव).
the stepwell may have originated to ensure water during periods of drought.
steps to reach the water level in artificially constructed reservoirs can be found in the sites of indus valley civilization such as dholavira and mohenjo-daro.
mohenjo-daro (dated earlier than 2,500 bc) has cylindrical brick lined wells which may be the predecessors of the stepwell.
the first rock-cut stepwells in india date from 200-400 ad.
the earliest example of a bath-like pond reached by steps is found at uperkot caves in junagadh.
these caves are dated to the 4th century.
navghan kuvo, a well with the circular staircase in the vicinity, is another example.
it was possibly built in western satrap (200-400 ad) or maitraka (600-700 ad) period, though some place it as late as the 11th century.
the nearby adi kadi ni vav was constructed either in the second half of the 10th century or the 15th century.
the stepwells at dhank in rajkot district are dated to 550-625 ad.
the stepped ponds at bhinmal (850-950 ad) are followed by it.
the stepwells were constructed in the southwestern region of gujarat around 600 ad; from there they spread north to rajasthan and subsequently to the north and west india.
initially used as an art form by hindus, the construction of these stepwells hit its peak during muslim rule from the 11th to 16th century.
one of the earliest existing example of stepwells was built in the 11th century in gujarat, the mata bhavani's stepwell.
a long flight of steps leads to the water below a sequence of multi-story open pavilions positioned along the east/west axis.
the elaborate ornamentation of the columns, brackets and beams are a prime example of how stepwells were used as a form of art.
the mughal rulers did not disrupt the culture that was practiced in these stepwells and encouraged the building of stepwells.
the authorities during the british raj found the hygiene of the stepwells less than desirable and installed pipe and pump systems to replace their purpose.
the stepwell ensures the availability of water during periods of drought.
the stepwells had social, cultural and religious significance.
these stepwells were proven to be well-built sturdy structures, after withstanding earthquakes.
many stepwells have ornamentation and details as elaborate as those of hindu temples.
proportions in relationship to the human body were used in their design, as they were in many other structures in indian architecture.
a number of surviving stepwells can be found across india, including in north karnataka (karnataka), gujarat, rajasthan, delhi, madhya pradesh, and maharashtra.
in 2016 a collaborative mapping project, stepwell atlas, started to map gps coordinates and collate information on stepwells.
over 2800 stepwells have so far been mapped.
in his book delhi heritage: top 10 baolis, vikramjit singh rooprai mentions that delhi alone has 32 stepwells.
out of these, 16 are lost, but their locations can be traced.
of the remaining 16, only 14 are accessible to public and the water level in these keeps varying, while 3 are now permanently dry.
significant stepwells include:
stepwells from mughal periods still exist in pakistan.
some are in preserved conditions while others are not.
stepped ponds are very similar to stepwells in terms of purpose but it is important to recognize the difference between these two types of structures.
generally, stepped ponds accompany nearby temples while stepwells are more isolated.
additionally, stepwells are dark and barely visible from the surface, while stepped ponds are illuminated by the light from the sun.
also, stepwells are quite linear in design compared to the rectangular shape of stepped ponds.
stepwells are certainly one of india's most unusual, but little-known, contributions to architecture.
they influenced many other structures in indian architecture, especially many that incorporate water into their design.
ram bagh in agra was the first mughal garden in india.
it was designed by the mughal emperor babur and reflected his notion of paradise not only through water and landscaping but also through symmetry by including a reflecting pool in the design.
naturally, he was entranced by stepwells and felt that one would complement the garden of his palace.
he built a baoli in agra fort.
many other mughal gardens include reflecting pools to enhance the landscape or as an elegant entrance.
additional famous gardens that incorporate water into their design include:

the westerplatte monument, also known as the monument of the coast defenders (polish: pomnik obrońców wybrzeża) is a war memorial located in gdańsk, poland, on the westereplatte peninsula in the gdańsk harbour channel constructed between 1964-1966 to commemorate the polish defenders of the military transit depot (wojskowa składnica tranzytowa, or wst) in the battle of westerplatte, one of the first battles in germany's invasion of poland, which marked the outbreak of world war ii in europe.
the urban project including an unrealized museum was drafted by adam haupt, while the monument itself was designed by sculptors franciszek duszeńko and henryk kitowski.
the project by duszeńko and kitowski was selected from 63 proposed projects.
the construction of the monument was initiated by the council for the protection of struggle and martyrdom sites (rada ochrony pamięci walk i męczeństwa) and consists of 236 granite blocks transported from the quarries in strzegom and borów and weighing 1,150 tons.
the monument is decorated with bas-reliefs and inscriptions, which pay tribute to the defence of the polish sea coast, the naval battles of wwii in which polish sailors and soldiers took part as well as the battle of lenino, battle of studzianki and battle of kołobrzeg.
the memorial also includes the inscription "glory to the liberators" (chwała wyzwolicielom).
the shape of the monument resembles in its appearance a jagged bayonet impaled in the ground.
seven candle lights at the foot of the monument symbolically represent the seven days of heroic defence of westerplatte by polish soldiers against the numerically superior nazi german army.
the 22-meter high artificial mound on which the monument is located was erected from the earth collected from the redevelopment of the port of gdańsk.
the construction of the monument took 2 years to complete and it was ceremonially unveiled on 9 october 1966 on the anniversary of the battle of lenino.
each year, official state ceremonies to commemorate the outbreak of the second world war take place at the foot of the monument and have been attended by prominent polish and foreign dignitaries and heads of states.
