the monument to the great fire of london, more commonly known simply as the monument, is a doric column in london, united kingdom, situated near the northern end of london bridge.
commemorating the great fire of london, it stands at the junction of monument street and fish street hill, 202 feet (62 m) in height and 202 feet west of the spot in pudding lane where the great fire started on 2 september 1666. constructed between 1671 and 1677, it was built on the site of st. margaret's, fish street, the first church to be destroyed by the great fire.
it is grade i listed and is a scheduled monument.
another monument, the golden boy of pye corner, marks the point near smithfield where the fire was stopped.
the monument comprises a fluted doric column built of portland stone topped with a gilded urn of fire.
it was designed by christopher wren and robert hooke.
its height marks its distance from the site of the shop of thomas farriner (or farynor), the king's baker, where the blaze began.
the viewing platform near the top of the monument is reached by a narrow winding staircase of 311 steps.
a mesh cage was added in the mid-19th century to prevent people jumping to the ground, after six people had committed suicide there between 1788 and 1842.
three sides of the base carry inscriptions in latin.
the one on the south side describes actions taken by king charles ii following the fire.
the inscription on the east side describes how the monument was started and brought to perfection, and under which mayors.
inscriptions on the north side describe how the fire started, how much damage it caused, and how it was eventually extinguished.
the latin words "sed furor papisticus qui tamdiu patravit nondum restingvitur" (but popish frenzy, which wrought such horrors, is not yet quenched) were added to the end of the inscription on the orders of the court of aldermen in 1681 during the foment of the popish plot.
text on the east side originally falsely blamed roman catholics for the fire ("burning of this protestant city, begun and carried on by the treachery and malice of the popish faction"), which  prompted alexander pope (himself a catholic) to say of the area:
where london's column, pointing at the skies,like a tall bully, lifts the head, and lies.– moral essays, epistle iii.
line 339 (1733–1734).
the words blaming catholics were chiselled out with catholic emancipation in 1830.
the west side of the base displays a sculpture, by caius gabriel cibber, in alto and bas relief, of the destruction of the city; with charles ii and his brother, james, the duke of york (later king james ii), surrounded by liberty, architecture, and science, giving directions for its restoration.
it gives its name to the nearby london underground station, monument.
the first rebuilding act, passed in 1669, stipulated that "the better to preserve the memory of this dreadful visitation", a column of either brass or stone should be set up on fish street hill, on or near the site of farynor's bakery, where the fire began.
christopher wren, as surveyor-general of the king's works, was asked to submit a design.
wren worked with robert hooke on the design.
it is impossible to disentangle the collaboration between hooke and wren, but hooke's drawings of possible designs for the column still exist, with wren's signature on them indicating his approval of the drawings rather than their authorship.
it was not until 1671 that the city council approved the design, and it took six years to complete the 202 ft column.
it was two more years before the inscription (which had been left to wren — or to wren's choice — to decide upon) was set in place.
"commemorating — with a brazen disregard for the truth — the fact that 'london rises again...three short years complete that which was considered the work of ages.'"
hooke's surviving drawings show that several versions of the monument were submitted for consideration: a plain obelisk, a column garnished with tongues of fire, and the fluted doric column that was eventually chosen.
the real contention came with the problem of what type of ornament to have at the top.
initially, wren favoured a statue of a phoenix with outstretched wings rising from the ashes, but as the column neared completion he decided instead on a 15 ft statue either of charles ii, or a sword-wielding female to represent a triumphant london; the cost of either being estimated at £1,050.
charles himself disliked the idea of his statue atop the monument and instead preferred a simple copper-gilded ball "with flames sprouting from the top", costing a little over £325, but ultimately it was the design of a flaming gilt-bronze urn suggested by robert hooke that was chosen.
the total cost of the monument was £13,450 11s 9d., of which £11,300 was paid to the mason-contractor joshua marshall.
(joshua marshall was master of the worshipful company of masons in 1670.)
the edinburgh-born writer james boswell visited the monument in 1763 to climb the 311 steps to what was then the highest viewpoint in london.
halfway up, he suffered a panic attack, but persevered and made it to the top, where he found it "horrid to be so monstrous a way up in the air, so far above london and all its spires".
the area around the base of the column, monument street, was pedestrianised in 2006 in a £790,000 street improvement scheme.
the monument closed in july 2007 for an 18-month, £4.5 million refurbishment project and re-opened in february 2009.

between 1 and 2 october 2011, a live music sculpture created especially for the monument by british composer samuel bordoli was performed 18 times during the weekend.
this was the first occasion that music had ever been heard inside the structure and effectively transformed wren's design into a gigantic reverberating musical instrument.
wren and hooke built the monument to double-up as a scientific instrument.
it has a central shaft meant for use as a zenith telescope and for use in gravity and pendulum experiments that connects to an underground laboratory for observers to work (accessible through a hatch in the floor of the present-day ticket booth).
vibrations from heavy traffic on fish street hill rendered the experimental conditions unsuitable.
at the top of the monument, a hinged lid in the urn covers the opening to the shaft.
the steps in the shaft of the tower are all six inches high, allowing them to be used for barometric pressure studies.
more recently, researchers from queen mary's university of london used the shaft of the monument stairwell to measure deformation in a hanging wire.
by twisting and untwisting a wire hanging down the shaft of the stairwell, they were able to detect deformation at less than 9 parts per billion - equivalent to a one degree twist over the length of the 50 meter wire.
during the 2007–2009 refurbishment, a 360-degree panoramic camera was installed on top of the monument.
updated every minute and running 24 hours a day, it provides a record of weather, building and ground activity in the city.
if the day were bright, you observed upon the house–tops, stretching far away, a long dark path; the shadow of the monument; and turning round, the tall original was close beside you, with every hair erect upon his golden head, as if the doings of the city frightened him.

horatio nelson, 1st viscount nelson, 1st  duke of bronté, kb (29 september 1758 – 21 october 1805) was a british flag officer in the royal navy famous for his participation in the napoleonic wars, most notably in the battle of trafalgar, during which he was killed.
he was responsible for several famous victories that helped to secure british control of the seas, both securing britain from french invasion and frustrating napoleon's imperial ambitions.
after his death during his defeat of the combined french and spanish fleets at trafalgar, there was a public outpouring of grief.
nelson was accorded a state funeral and was buried in st paul's cathedral.
a number of monuments and memorials were constructed across the country to honour his memory.
the period of british dominance of the seas that his victories were considered to have ushered in led to a continued drive to create monuments in his name across the british empire.
these have taken many forms.
the monumental nelson's column (built in 1840s) and the surrounding trafalgar square are notable locations in london to this day, and nelson's funerary monument can be found in the south transept of st paul's cathedral.
there are three great collections of items that belonged to him, or were made to commemorate him that are still visible today: at the royal naval museum in hmnb portsmouth, at the national maritime museum at greenwich and in the lloyd's building in the heart of london.
also at portsmouth, nelson's flagship at trafalgar, hms victory is preserved; on the quarterdeck, a small brass plaque with the inscription "here nelson fell 21st oct 1805" records the place where nelson was shot.
the first large monument to nelson was the 43.5 m (143 ft) tall nelson monument on glasgow green erected less than a year after his death in 1806. the nelson monument in edinburgh was later constructed atop calton hill in edinburgh between 1807 and 1816. the first monument in the british empire to be funded by popular subscription was nelson's column, montreal, on august 17, 1809. in october 1809, the first monument to be funded by public subscription in great britain was erected in birmingham.
the statue of nelson in birmingham was the first to be erected in nelson's honour in great britain.
it was sculpted by richard westmacott and is currently a grade ii* listed building.
westmacott also sculpted memorials in liverpool, which is also grade ii*, and bridgetown, barbados.
the liverpool monument is a depiction of a goddess handing a naked nelson the crowns of victory while a sinister, skeletal figure of death clutches at his breast.
four despondent french prisoners-in-chains sit at the base.
the officers and men who fought at trafalgar erected a memorial column to the north of portsmouth atop portsdown hill.
the 36.5 m (120 ft) high obelisk features the inscription "consecrated to the memory of viscount lord nelson.
by the zealous attachment of all those who fought at trafalgar to perpetuate his triumph and their regret 1805. foundation stone laid july 1807".
the 44 m (144 ft) tall columnar monument in great yarmouth to nelson was started before his death but only completed in 1819. properly called the norfolk naval pillar, it is generally known as the "britannia monument" as it is topped by the martial female personification of the uk rather than a statue of nelson; a statue of nelson is, however, in the grounds of norwich cathedral alongside the other napoleonic hero, the duke of wellington, near the school he attended.
another columnar monument is situated on castle geen, hereford.
nelson was made a freeman of the city in 1802, and he reportedly spent a lot of time at ross-on-wye.
the column was erected in 1809, four years after nelson's death, but has no statue at the top as there wasn't enough money left to commission one.
one of the most unusual monuments was constructed on salisbury plain, within cannon shot of stonehenge, on land then owned by the marquess of queensberry.
the monument consists of a series of clumps of trees in otherwise arable farmland.
known as the nile clumps they have been arranged to represent the positioning of french and british ships at the battle of the nile, considered as nelson's greatest tactical victory.
some clumps still survive, and work is underway to replant some of those that have "sunk".
they stand on land owned by the national trust, forming part of the stonehenge landscape estate.
there is also a memorial to nelson on the banks of the menai strait in north wales.
this memorial stands at an out-of-the-way site on the shore below plas llanfair, in llanfairpwll on the anglesey shore.
it was created by admiral lord clarence paget, who lived in the mansion and who was an enthusiastic amateur sculptor.
the monument is made of stone, inscribed with the words "nelson" on the base of the statue.
the words "fell at trafalgar 1805" are ingraved in slate on the west side of the plinth and repeated in welsh on the east side.
on the south side is a slate engraved with "england expects that every man will do his duty".
the view from this position is of the menai strait, which nelson was reputed to have described as "one of the most treacherous stretches of sea in the world."
there is also the nelson memorial in swarland, northumberland which was raised as a private memorial of nelson by his friend and sometime agent, alexander davison.
davidson also planted trees just to the west of the obelisk to represent the coastline of the nile delta and some of the ships that took part in the battle of the nile.
a small memorial to nelson is located in the small county antrim town of dervock, northern ireland.
in the allen memorial hall belonging to st coleman’s church of ireland, a large stained glass triptych depicts the moment on the poop deck of the victory when nelson ordered the flying of the ‘england expects’ signal just before the battle of trafalgar.
the connection with dervock is seen in the panel portraying the red-jacketed captain william adair, from ballymena, in county antrim, the commander of the marine force on the victory, who was to die alongside nelson.
a smaller window in the hall shows the victory locked in conflict with the french ship redoubtable.
although it does not bear his name, paxton's paxton's tower  near llanarthney in carmarthenshire, wales was built in nelson's honour.
it once bore the following inscription: "to the invincible commander, viscount nelson, in commemoration of the deeds before the walls of copenhagen, and on the shores of spain; of the empire every where maintained by him over the seas; and of the death which in the fulness of his own glory, though ultimately for his own country and for europe, conquering, he died; this tower was erected by william paxton."
(see british listed buildings)
although his country house at merton no longer exists and his estate was broken up and built over, nelson's association with the area is commemorated in the names of a number of local roads, a trading estate on part of his former lands and nelson hospital in merton park.
nelson's funerary hatchment is displayed at st. mary's church of england, also in merton park, london sw19.
there is a nelson's monument on birchen edge, in the peak district national park in derbyshire.
the monument itself consists of a 3 metre tall gritstone obelisk, surmounted by a ball 30 cm in diameter.
the column is inscribed with the date of nelson's death and some other letters which may be later graffiti.
a modern metal plaque shows that the monument was restored in 1992 by the 1805 club and the peak district national park.
three nearby gritstone outcrops, known as the "three ships" because of their slight resemblance to ships' prows, are inscribed victory, defiance and royal soverin (sic), named after british warships at trafalgar.
the monument was created in 1810 and is thought to have been funded by john brightman from the local village of baslow.
in 1995, in honour of nelson, the admiral lord nelson school was built in portsmouth.
the school has established and maintains strong links with the royal navy and was involved in the bicentennial commemoration of the battle of trafalgar.
there are a hundred and ninety-nine street names in the u.k. today that refer to nelson's final and possibly greatest victory, trafalgar.
a 2011 survey of british pub names found seventy-eight pubs called "lord nelson", thirty-one called "nelson", five called "admiral nelson" and five "nelson's"; in addition, sixteen pubs were named "trafalgar" and thirty-two "victory".
throughout october, trafalgar night dinners are held in royal navy ships and establishments.
after the loyal toast, there is always a toast drunk to nelson's "immortal memory".
several places overseas have been named after nelson.
the city of nelson, new zealand bears his name as well as nelson island on the sunshine coast, british columbia, canada.
there is also nelson's island, in aboukir bay, the site of nelson's victory at the battle of the nile.
two pillars were erected to nelson in cities in montreal and dublin, both by public subscription in the second half of 1809. nelson's pillar in dublin survived controversy and rebellion and ireland’s exit from the united kingdom in 1922, but it was destroyed by a bomb planted by former ira men in 1966, on the eve of the 50th anniversary of the easter rising.
nelson's column, montreal is located in montreal, quebec (where nelson had reportedly fallen in love with a young woman).
the monument was begun in 1808 and erected in 1809. it is located in place jacques-cartier, which was a marketplace at the time.
as the dublin monument is no longer extant it is the oldest surviving monument to nelson.
subscribers for the monument included both english and french, since the french revolution was popular with neither.
the monument is located in old montreal (vieux montréal).
it has carved scenes from nelson's career around the base and the statue on top was claimed to be the oldest public statue of nelson in the world.
it was removed due to excessive weathering and has been placed in the montreal history centre.
a copy now stands atop the column in its place.
a small monument was erected to nelson in county cork, ireland.
it is claimed that it was erected within four days of the news of the admiral’s death reaching london on 6 november 1805. the monument consisted of a large rough stone arch on a hilltop near castletownshend.
it was destroyed 150 years later by irish republicans.
this nelson arch, as it was known, was the work of captain joshua rowley watson rn, then commander of the sea fencibles based in castletownshend.
one of the few surviving images of the arch dates from 1896. it is a photograph reproduced in the journal of the cork historical and archaeological society, and shows the arch largely intact, but with vegetation sprouting from it.
the first mention of politically motivated damage to the arch comes in 1920, when according to some accounts it was ‘destroyed’ during the war of independence, and re-erected two years later.
it was again attacked in 1966, this time so seriously that the townshend family, who whose land it stood, could do little more than erect a much smaller version from the wreckage.
that in turn was demolished in 1976.
on the island of nevis, west indies, where nelson met and married frances nisbet, there are two place names: nelson's spring and nelson's lookout.
on the island of antigua, west indies, there is a house at nelson's dockyard that is historically taught to be nelson's house while he was stationed in the caribbean.
on 28 october 2005, a statue of nelson was unveiled in gibraltar 200 years after nelson's death.
in 1813, a statue (pictured) was erected in bridgetown, barbados, in what was known as trafalgar square, (now renamed national heroes' square) in recognition of nelson's bravery and as a tribute to his honour within the british empire.
this statue was sculpted from bronze by sir richard westmacott and is considered by many as an exact likeness to the man himself.
this statue was erected some 27 years before another one of the same likeness was erected in london.
the nelson monument built on glasgow green in 1806 was the first major tribute in stone to the 'hero of trafalgar'.

a monument is a type of—usually three-dimensional—structure that was explicitly created to commemorate a person or event, or which has become relevant to a social group as a part of their remembrance of historic times or cultural heritage, due to its artistic, historical, political, technical or architectural importance.
some of the first monuments were dolmens or menhirs, megalithic constructions built for religious or funerary purposes.
examples of monuments include statues, (war) memorials, historical buildings, archaeological sites, and cultural assets.
if there is a public interest in its preservation, a monument can for example be listed as a unesco world heritage site.
the origin of the word "monument" comes from the greek mnemosynon and the latin moneo, monere, which means 'to remind', 'to advise' or 'to warn', suggesting a monument allows us to see the past thus helping us visualize what is to come in the future.
in english the word "monumental" is often used in reference to something of extraordinary size and power, as in monumental sculpture, but also to mean simply anything made to commemorate the dead, as a funerary monument or other example of funerary art.
monuments have been created for thousands of years, and they are often the most durable and famous symbols of ancient civilizations.
prehistoric tumuli, dolmens, and similar structures have been created in a large number of prehistoric cultures across the world, and the many forms of monumental tombs of the more wealthy and powerful members of a society are often the source of much of our information and art from those cultures.
as societies became organized on a larger scale, so monuments so large as to be difficult to destroy like the egyptian pyramids, the greek parthenon, the great wall of china, indian taj mahal or the moai of easter island have become symbols of their civilizations.
in more recent times, monumental structures such as the statue of liberty and eiffel tower have become iconic emblems of modern nation-states.
the term monumentality relates to the symbolic status and physical presence of a monument.
in this context, german art historian helmut scharf states that “a monument exists in the form of an object and also as symbol thereof.
as a language symbol, a monument usually refers to something concrete, in some rare cases it is also used metaphorically .... a monument can be a language symbol for a unity of several monuments ... or only for a single one, but in a broader sense it can also be used in nearly all knowable planes of being.
... what is considered a monument always depends on the importance it attributes to the prevailing or traditional consciousness of a specific historical and social situation.”
basically, the definition framework of the term monument depends on the current historical frame conditions.
aspects of the culture of remembrance and cultural memory are also linked to it, as well as questions about the concepts of public sphere and durability (of the one memorized) and the form and content of the monument (work-like monument).
from an art historical point of view, the dichotomy of content and form opens up the problem of the “linguistic ability” of the monument.
it becomes clear that language is an eminent part of a monument and it is often represented in “non-objective” or “architectural monuments”, at least with a plaque.
in this connection, the debate touches on the social mechanisms that combine with remembrance.
these are acceptance of the monument as an object, the conveyed contents and the impact of these contents.
monuments are frequently used to improve the appearance of a city or location.
planned cities such as washington d.c., new delhi and brasília are often built around monuments.
for example, the washington monument's location was conceived by l'enfant to help organize public space in the city, before it was designed or constructed.
older cities have monuments placed at locations that are already important or are sometimes redesigned to focus on one.
as shelley suggested in his famous poem "ozymandias" ("look on my works, ye mighty, and despair!
"), the purpose of monuments is very often to impress or awe.
structures created for others purposes that have been made notable by their age, size or historic significance may also be regarded as monuments.
this can happen because of great age and size, as in the case of the great wall of china, or because an event of great importance occurred there such as the village of oradour-sur-glane in france.
many countries use ancient monument or similar terms for the official designation of protected structures or archeological sites which may originally have been ordinary domestic houses or other buildings.
monuments are also often designed to convey historical or political information, and they can thus develop an active socio-political potency.
they can be used to reinforce the primacy of contemporary political power, such as the column of trajan or the numerous statues of lenin in the soviet union.
they can be used to educate the populace about important events or figures from the past, such as in the renaming of the old general post office building in new york city to the james a. farley building (james farley post office), after former postmaster general james farley.
to fulfill its informative and educative functions a monument needs to be open to the public, which means that its spatial dimension as well as its content can be experienced by the public, and be sustainable.
the former may be achieved either by situating the monument in public space or by a public discussion about the monument and its meaning, the latter by the materiality of the monument or if its content immediately becomes part of the collective or cultural memory.
the social meanings of monuments are rarely fixed and certain and are frequently 'contested' by different social groups.
as an example: whilst the former east german socialist state may have seen the berlin wall as a means of 'protection' from the ideological impurity of the west, dissidents and others would often argue that it was symbolic of the inherent repression and paranoia of that state.
this contention of meaning is a central theme of modern 'post processual' archaeological discourse.
the term is often used to describe any structure that is a significant and legally protected historic work, and many countries have equivalents of what is called in united kingdom legislation a scheduled monument, which often include relatively recent buildings constructed for residential or industrial purposes, with no thought at the time that they would come to be regarded as "monuments".
until recently, it was customary for archaeologists to study large monuments and pay less attention to the everyday lives of the societies that created them.
new ideas about what constitutes the archaeological record have revealed that certain legislative and theoretical approaches to the subject are too focused on earlier definitions of monuments.
an example has been the united kingdom's scheduled ancient monument laws.
other than municipal or national government that protecting the monuments in their jurisdiction, there are institutions dedicated on the efforts to protect and preserve monuments that considered to possess special natural or cultural significance for the world, such as unesco's world heritage site programme and world monuments fund.
cultural monuments are also considered to be the memory of a community and are therefore particularly at risk in the context of modern asymmetrical warfare.
the enemy's cultural heritage is to be sustainably damaged or even destroyed.
in addition to the national protection of cultural monuments, international organizations (cf.
unesco world heritage, blue shield international) therefore try to protect cultural monuments.
recently, more and more monuments are being preserved digitally (in 3d models) through organisations as cyark.

william wilberforce (24 august 1759 – 29 july 1833) was a british politician, philanthropist, and a leader of the movement to abolish the slave trade.
a native of kingston upon hull, yorkshire, he began his political career in 1780, eventually becoming an independent member of parliament (mp) for yorkshire (1784–1812).
in 1785, he became an evangelical christian, which resulted in major changes to his lifestyle and a lifelong concern for reform.
in 1787, he came into contact with thomas clarkson and a group of anti-slave-trade activists, including granville sharp, hannah more and charles middleton.
they persuaded wilberforce to take on the cause of abolition, and he soon became one of the leading english abolitionists.
he headed the parliamentary campaign against the british slave trade for twenty years until the passage of the slave trade act of 1807.
wilberforce was convinced of the importance of religion, morality and education.
he championed causes and campaigns such as the society for the suppression of vice, british missionary work in india, the creation of a free colony in sierra leone, the foundation of the church mission society, and the society for the prevention of cruelty to animals.
his underlying conservatism led him to support politically and socially controversial legislation, and resulted in criticism that he was ignoring injustices at home while campaigning for the enslaved abroad.
in later years, wilberforce supported the campaign for the complete abolition of slavery, and continued his involvement after 1826, when he resigned from parliament because of his failing health.
that campaign led to the slavery abolition act 1833, which abolished slavery in most of the british empire.
wilberforce died just three days after hearing that the passage of the act through parliament was assured.
he was buried in westminster abbey, close to his friend william pitt the younger.
wilberforce was born in a house on the high street of hull, in the east riding of yorkshire, england, on 24 august 1759, the only son of robert wilberforce (1728–1768), a wealthy merchant, and his wife, elizabeth bird (1730–1798).
his grandfather, william (1690–1774 or 1776), had made the family fortune in the maritime trade with baltic countries, and had twice been elected mayor of hull.
wilberforce was a small, sickly and delicate child with poor eyesight.
in 1767, he began attending hull grammar school, which at the time was headed by a young, dynamic headmaster, joseph milner, who was to become a lifelong friend.
wilberforce profited from the supportive atmosphere at the school, until the death of his father in 1768 caused changes in his living arrangements.
with his mother struggling to cope, the nine-year-old wilberforce was sent to a prosperous uncle and aunt with houses in both st james' place, london, and wimbledon, at that time a village 7 miles (11 km) south-west of london.
he attended an "indifferent" boarding school in putney for two years.
he spent his holidays in wimbledon, where he grew extremely fond of his relatives.
he became interested in evangelical christianity due to his relatives' influence, especially that of his aunt hannah, sister of the wealthy christian merchant john thornton, a philanthropist and a supporter of the leading methodist preacher george whitefield.wilberforce's staunchly church of england mother and grandfather, alarmed at these nonconformist influences and at his leanings towards evangelicalism, brought the 12-year-old boy back to hull in 1771. wilberforce was heartbroken at being separated from his aunt and uncle.
his family opposed a return to hull grammar school because the headmaster had become a methodist, and wilberforce therefore continued his education at nearby pocklington school from 1771 to 1776. influenced by methodist scruples, he initially resisted hull's lively social life, but, as his religious fervour diminished, he embraced theatre-going, attended balls, and played cards.
in october 1776, at the age of 17, wilberforce went up to st john's college, cambridge.
the deaths of his grandfather and uncle in 1777 had left him independently wealthy and as a result he had little inclination or need to apply himself to serious study.
instead he immersed himself in the social round of student life and pursued a hedonistic lifestyle, enjoying cards, gambling and late-night drinking sessions – although he found the excesses of some of his fellow students distasteful.
witty, generous and an excellent conversationalist, wilberforce was a popular figure.
he made many friends including the more studious future prime minister william pitt.
despite his lifestyle and lack of interest in studying, he managed to pass his examinations and was awarded a bachelor of arts degree in 1781 and an master of arts degree in 1788.
wilberforce began to consider a political career while still at university, and during the winter of 1779–1780, he and pitt frequently watched house of commons debates from the gallery.
pitt, already set on a political career, encouraged wilberforce to join him in obtaining a parliamentary seat.
in september 1780, at the age of twenty-one and while still a student, wilberforce was elected member of parliament (mp) for kingston upon hull, spending over £8,000, as was the custom of the time, to ensure he received the necessary votes.
free from financial pressures, wilberforce sat as an independent, resolving to be "no party man".
criticised at times for inconsistency, he supported both tory and whig governments according to his conscience, working closely with the party in power, and voting on specific measures according to their merits.
wilberforce attended parliament regularly, but he also maintained a lively social life, becoming an habitué of gentlemen's gambling clubs such as goostree's and boodle's in pall mall, london.
the writer and socialite madame de staël described him as the "wittiest man in england" and, according to georgiana, duchess of devonshire, the prince of wales said that he would go anywhere to hear wilberforce sing.
wilberforce used his speaking voice to great effect in political speeches; the diarist and author james boswell witnessed wilberforce's eloquence in the house of commons and noted, "i saw what seemed a mere shrimp mount upon the table; but as i listened, he grew, and grew, until the shrimp became a whale."
during the frequent government changes of 1781–1784, wilberforce supported his friend pitt in parliamentary debates.
in autumn 1783, pitt, wilberforce and edward eliot (later to become pitt's brother-in-law), travelled to france for a six-week holiday together.
after a difficult start in rheims, where their presence aroused police suspicion that they were english spies, they visited paris, meeting benjamin franklin, general lafayette, marie antoinette and louis xvi, and joined the french court at fontainebleau.
pitt became prime minister in december 1783, with wilberforce a key supporter of his minority government.
despite their close friendship, there is no record that pitt offered wilberforce a ministerial position in this or future governments.
this may have been due to wilberforce's wish to remain an independent mp.
alternatively, wilberforce's frequent tardiness and disorganisation, as well as the chronic eye problems that at times made reading impossible, may have convinced pitt that his trusted friend was not ministerial material.
wilberforce never sought office and was never offered one.
when parliament was dissolved in the spring of 1784, wilberforce decided to stand as a candidate for the county of yorkshire in the 1784 general election.
on 6 april, he was returned as mp for yorkshire at the age of twenty-four.
in october 1784, wilberforce embarked upon a tour of europe which would ultimately change his life and determine his future career.
he travelled with his mother and sister in the company of isaac milner, the brilliant younger brother of his former headmaster, who had been fellow of queens' college, cambridge, in the year when wilberforce first went up.
they visited the french riviera and enjoyed the usual pastimes of dinners, cards, and gambling.
in february 1785, wilberforce returned to london temporarily, to support pitt's proposals for parliamentary reforms.
he rejoined the party in genoa, italy, from where they continued their tour to switzerland.
milner accompanied wilberforce to england, and on the journey they read the rise and progress of religion in the soul by philip doddridge, a leading early 18th-century english nonconformist.
after his earlier interest in evangelical religion when he was young, wilberforce's journey to faith seems to have begun afresh at this time.
he started to rise early to read the bible and pray and kept a private journal.
he underwent an evangelical conversion, regretting his past life and resolving to commit his future life and work to the service of god.
his conversion changed some of his habits, but not his nature: he remained outwardly cheerful, interested and respectful, tactfully urging others towards his new faith.
inwardly, he underwent an agonising struggle and became relentlessly self-critical, harshly judging his spirituality, use of time, vanity, self-control and relationships with others.
at the time, religious enthusiasm was generally regarded as a social transgression and was stigmatised in polite society.
evangelicals in the upper classes, such as sir richard hill, the methodist mp for shropshire, and selina hastings, countess of huntingdon, were exposed to contempt and ridicule, and wilberforce's conversion led him to question whether he should remain in public life.
he sought guidance from john newton, a leading evangelical anglican clergyman of the day and rector of st mary woolnoth in the city of london.
both newton and pitt counselled him to remain in politics, and he resolved to do so "with increased diligence and conscientiousness".
thereafter, his political views were informed by his faith and by his desire to promote christianity and christian ethics in private and public life.
his views were often deeply conservative, opposed to radical changes in a god-given political and social order, and focused on issues such as the observance of the sabbath and the eradication of immorality through education and reform.
as a result, he was often distrusted by progressive voices because of his conservatism, and regarded with suspicion by many tories who saw evangelicals as radicals, bent on the overthrow of church and state.
in 1786, wilberforce leased a house in old palace yard, westminster, in order to be near parliament.
he began using his parliamentary position to advocate reform by introducing a registration bill, proposing limited changes to parliamentary election procedures.
he brought forward a bill to extend the measure permitting the dissection after execution of criminals such as rapists, arsonists and thieves.
the bill also advocated the reduction of sentences for women convicted of treason, a crime that at the time included a husband's murder.
the house of commons passed both bills, but they were defeated in the house of lords.
the british initially became involved in the slave trade during the 16th century.
by 1783, the triangular route that took british-made goods to africa to buy slaves, transported the enslaved to the west indies, and then brought slave-grown products such as sugar, tobacco, and cotton to britain, represented about 80 percent of great britain's foreign income.
british ships dominated the trade, supplying french, spanish, dutch, portuguese and british colonies, and in peak years carried forty thousand enslaved men, women and children across the atlantic in the horrific conditions of the middle passage.
of the estimated 11 million africans transported into slavery, about 1.4 million died during the voyage.
the british campaign to abolish the slave trade is generally considered to have begun in the 1780s with the establishment of the quakers' anti-slavery committees, and their presentation to parliament of the first slave trade petition in 1783. the same year, wilberforce, while dining with his old cambridge friend gerard edwards, met rev.
james ramsay, a ship's surgeon who had become a clergyman on the island of st christopher (later st kitts) in the leeward islands, and a medical supervisor of the plantations there.
what ramsay had witnessed of the conditions endured by the slaves, both at sea and on the plantations, horrified him.
returning to england after fifteen years, he accepted the living of teston, kent in 1781, and there met sir charles middleton, lady middleton, thomas clarkson, hannah more and others, a group that later became known as the testonites.
interested in promoting christianity and moral improvement in britain and overseas, they were appalled by ramsay's reports of the depraved lifestyles of slave owners, the cruel treatment meted out to the enslaved, and the lack of christian instruction provided to the slaves.
with their encouragement and help, ramsay spent three years writing an essay on the treatment and conversion of african slaves in the british sugar colonies, which was highly critical of slavery in the west indies.
the book, published in 1784, was to have an important impact in raising public awareness and interest, and it excited the ire of west indian planters who in the coming years attacked both ramsay and his ideas in a series of proslavery tracts.
wilberforce apparently did not follow up on his meeting with ramsay.
however, three years later, and inspired by his new faith, wilberforce was growing interested in humanitarian reform.
in november 1786, he received a letter from sir charles middleton that re-opened his interest in the slave trade.
at the urging of lady middleton, sir charles suggested that wilberforce bring forward the abolition of the slave trade in parliament.
wilberforce responded that he "felt the great importance of the subject, and thought himself unequal to the task allotted to him, but yet would not positively decline it".
he began to read widely on the subject, and met with the testonites at middleton's home at barham court in teston in the early winter of 1786–1787.
in early 1787, thomas clarkson, a fellow graduate of st john's, cambridge, who had become convinced of the need to end the slave trade after writing a prize-winning essay on the subject while at cambridge, called upon wilberforce at old palace yard with a published copy of the work.
this was the first time the two men had met; their collaboration would last nearly fifty years.
clarkson began to visit wilberforce on a weekly basis, bringing first-hand evidence he had obtained about the slave trade.the quakers, already working for abolition, also recognised the need for influence within parliament, and urged clarkson to secure a commitment from wilberforce to bring forward the case for abolition in the house of commons.
it was arranged that bennet langton, a lincolnshire landowner and mutual acquaintance of wilberforce and clarkson, would organize a dinner party in order to ask wilberforce formally to lead the parliamentary campaign.
the dinner took place on 13 march 1787; other guests included charles middleton, sir joshua reynolds, william windham, mp, james boswell and isaac hawkins browne, mp.
by the end of the evening, wilberforce had agreed in general terms that he would bring forward the abolition of the slave trade in parliament, "provided that no person more proper could be found".
the same spring, on 12 may 1787, the still hesitant wilberforce held a conversation with william pitt and the future prime minister william grenville as they sat under a large oak tree on pitt's estate in kent.
under what came to be known as the "wilberforce oak" at holwood, pitt challenged his friend: "wilberforce, why don't you give notice of a motion on the subject of the slave trade?
you have already taken great pains to collect evidence, and are therefore fully entitled to the credit which doing so will ensure you.
do not lose time, or the ground will be occupied by another."
wilberforce's response is not recorded, but he later declared in old age that he could "distinctly remember the very knoll on which i was sitting near pitt and grenville" where he made his decision.
wilberforce's involvement in the abolition movement was motivated by a desire to put his christian principles into action and to serve god in public life.
he and other evangelicals were horrified by what they perceived was a depraved and un-christian trade, and the greed and avarice of the owners and traders.
wilberforce sensed a call from god, writing in a journal entry in 1787 that "god almighty has set before me two great objects, the suppression of the slave trade and the reformation of manners [moral values]".
the conspicuous involvement of evangelicals in the highly popular anti-slavery movement served to improve the status of a group otherwise associated with the less popular campaigns against vice and immorality.
on 22 may 1787, the first meeting of the society for effecting the abolition of the slave trade took place, bringing like-minded british quakers and anglicans together in the same organisation for the first time.
the committee chose to campaign against the slave trade rather than slavery itself, with many members believing that slavery would eventually disappear as a natural consequence of the abolition of the trade.
wilberforce, though involved informally, did not join the committee officially until 1791.
the society was highly successful in raising public awareness and support, and local chapters sprang up throughout great britain.
clarkson travelled the country researching and collecting first-hand testimony and statistics, while the committee promoted the campaign, pioneering techniques such as lobbying, writing pamphlets, holding public meetings, gaining press attention, organising boycotts and even using a campaign logo: an image of a kneeling slave above the motto "am i not a man and a brother?
", designed by the renowned pottery-maker josiah wedgwood.
the committee also sought to influence slave-trading nations such as france, spain, portugal, denmark, holland and the united states, corresponding with anti-slavery activists in other countries and organising the translation of english-language books and pamphlets.
these included books by former slaves ottobah cugoano and olaudah equiano, who had published influential works on slavery and the slave trade in 1787 and 1789 respectively.
they and other free blacks, collectively known as "sons of africa", spoke at debating societies and wrote spirited letters to newspapers, periodicals and prominent figures, as well as public letters of support to campaign allies.
hundreds of parliamentary petitions opposing the slave trade were received in 1788 and following years, with hundreds of thousands of signatories in total.
the campaign proved to be the world's first grassroots human rights campaign, in which men and women from different social classes and backgrounds volunteered to try to end the injustices suffered by others.
wilberforce had planned to introduce a motion giving notice that he would bring forward a bill for the abolition of the slave trade during the 1789 parliamentary session.
however, in january 1788, he was taken ill with a probable stress-related condition, now thought to be ulcerative colitis.
it was several months before he was able to resume work, and he spent time convalescing at bath and cambridge.
his regular bouts of gastrointestinal illnesses precipitated the use of moderate quantities of opium, which proved effective in alleviating his condition, and which he continued to use for the rest of his life.
in wilberforce's absence, pitt, who had long been supportive of abolition, introduced the preparatory motion himself, and ordered a privy council investigation into the slave trade, followed by a house of commons review.
with the publication of the privy council report in april 1789 and following months of planning, wilberforce commenced his parliamentary campaign.
on 12 may 1789, he made his first major speech on the subject of abolition in the house of commons, in which he reasoned that the trade was morally reprehensible and an issue of natural justice.
drawing on thomas clarkson's mass of evidence, he described in detail the appalling conditions in which slaves travelled from africa in the middle passage, and argued that abolishing the trade would also bring an improvement to the conditions of existing slaves in the west indies.
he moved 12 resolutions condemning the slave trade, but made no reference to the abolition of slavery itself, instead dwelling on the potential for reproduction in the existing slave population should the trade be abolished.
with the tide running against them, the opponents of abolition delayed the vote by proposing that the house of commons hear its own evidence, and wilberforce, in a move that has subsequently been criticised for prolonging the slave trade, reluctantly agreed.
the hearings were not completed by the end of the parliamentary session, and were deferred until the following year.
in the meantime, wilberforce and clarkson tried unsuccessfully to take advantage of the egalitarian atmosphere of the french revolution to press for france's abolition of the trade, which was, in any event, to be abolished in 1794 as a result of the bloody slave revolt in st. domingue (later to be known as haiti), although later briefly restored by napoleon in 1802. in january 1790, wilberforce succeeded in speeding up the hearings by gaining approval for a smaller parliamentary select committee to consider the vast quantity of evidence which had been accumulated.
wilberforce's house in old palace yard became a centre for the abolitionists' campaign and a focus for many strategy meetings.
petitioners for other causes also besieged him there, and his ante-room was thronged from an early hour, like "noah's ark, full of beasts clean and unclean", according to hannah more.
william wilberforce — speech before the house of commons, 18 april 1791
interrupted by a general election in june 1790, the committee finally finished hearing witnesses, and in april 1791 with a closely reasoned four-hour speech, wilberforce introduced the first parliamentary bill to abolish the slave trade.
however, after two evenings of debate, the bill was easily defeated by 163 votes to 88, the political climate having swung in a conservative direction in the wake of the french revolution and in reaction to an increase in radicalism and to slave revolts in the french west indies.
such was the public hysteria of the time that even wilberforce himself was suspected by some of being a jacobin agitator.
this was the beginning of a protracted parliamentary campaign, during which wilberforce's commitment never wavered, despite frustration and hostility.
he was supported in his work by fellow members of the so-called clapham sect, among whom was his best friend and cousin henry thornton.
holding evangelical christian convictions, and consequently dubbed "the saints", the group mainly lived in large houses surrounding the common in clapham, then a village to the south-west of london.
wilberforce accepted an invitation to share a house with henry thornton in 1792, moving into his own home after thornton's marriage in 1796. the "saints" were an informal community, characterised by considerable intimacy as well as a commitment to practical christianity and an opposition to slavery.
they developed a relaxed family atmosphere, wandering freely in and out of each other's homes and gardens, and discussing the many religious, social and political topics that engaged them.
pro-slavery advocates claimed that enslaved africans were lesser human beings who benefited from their bondage.
wilberforce, the clapham sect and others were anxious to demonstrate that africans, and particularly freed slaves, had human and economic abilities beyond the slave trade, and that they were capable of sustaining a well-ordered society, trade and cultivation.
inspired in part by the utopian vision of granville sharp, they became involved in the establishment in 1792 of a free colony in sierra leone with black settlers from britain, nova scotia and jamaica, as well as native africans and some whites.
they formed the sierra leone company, with wilberforce subscribing liberally to the project in money and time.
the dream was of an ideal society in which races would mix on equal terms; the reality was fraught with tension, crop failures, disease, death, war and defections to the slave trade.
initially a commercial venture, the british government assumed responsibility for the colony in 1808. the colony, although troubled at times, was to become a symbol of anti-slavery in which residents, communities and african tribal chiefs, worked together to prevent enslavement at the source, supported by a british naval blockade to stem the region's slave trade.
on 2 april 1792, wilberforce again brought a bill calling for abolition.
the memorable debate that followed drew contributions from the greatest orators in the house, william pitt the younger and charles james fox, as well as from wilberforce himself.
lord melville, as home secretary, proposed a compromise solution of so-called "gradual abolition" over a number of years.
this was passed by 230 to 85 votes, but the compromise was little more than a clever ploy, with the intention of ensuring that total abolition would be delayed indefinitely.
on 26 february 1793, another vote to abolish the slave trade was narrowly defeated by eight votes.
the outbreak of war with france the same month effectively prevented any further serious consideration of the issue, as politicians concentrated on the national crisis and the threat of invasion.
the same year, and again in 1794, wilberforce unsuccessfully brought before parliament a bill to outlaw british ships from supplying slaves to foreign colonies.
he voiced his concern about the war and urged pitt and his government to make greater efforts to end hostilities.
growing more alarmed, on 31 december 1794, wilberforce moved that the government seek a peaceful resolution with france, a stance that created a temporary breach in his long friendship with pitt.
abolition continued to be associated in the public consciousness with the french revolution and with british radical groups, resulting in a decline in public support.
in 1795, the society for effecting the abolition of the slave trade ceased to meet, and clarkson retired in ill-health to the lake district.
however, despite the decreased interest in abolition, wilberforce continued to introduce abolition bills throughout the 1790s.
the early years of the 19th century once again saw an increased public interest in abolition.
in 1804, clarkson resumed his work and the society for effecting the abolition of the slave trade began meeting again, strengthened with prominent new members such as zachary macaulay, henry brougham and james stephen.
in june 1804, wilberforce's bill to abolish the slave trade successfully passed all its stages through the house of commons.
however, it was too late in the parliamentary session for it to complete its passage through the house of lords.
on its reintroduction during the 1805 session, it was defeated, with even the usually sympathetic pitt failing to support it.
on this occasion and throughout the campaign, abolition was held back by wilberforce's trusting, even credulous nature, and his deferential attitude towards those in power.
he found it difficult to believe that men of rank would not do what he perceived to be the right thing, and was reluctant to confront them when they did not.
following pitt's death in january 1806, wilberforce began to collaborate more with the whigs, especially the abolitionists.
he gave general support to the grenville–fox administration, which brought more abolitionists into the cabinet; wilberforce and charles fox led the campaign in the house of commons, while lord grenville advocated the cause in the house of lords.
a radical change of tactics, which involved the introduction of a bill to ban british subjects from aiding or participating in the slave trade to the french colonies, was suggested by maritime lawyer james stephen.
it was a shrewd move, since the majority of british ships were now flying american flags and supplying slaves to foreign colonies with whom britain was at war.
a bill was introduced and approved by the cabinet, and wilberforce and other abolitionists maintained a self-imposed silence, so as not to draw any attention to the effect of the bill.
the approach proved successful, and the new foreign slave trade bill was quickly passed, and received royal assent on 23 may 1806. wilberforce and clarkson had collected a large volume of evidence against the slave trade over the previous two decades, and wilberforce spent the latter part of 1806 writing a letter on the abolition of the slave trade, which was a comprehensive restatement of the abolitionists' case.
the death of fox in september 1806 was a blow, but was followed quickly by a general election in the autumn of 1806. slavery became an election issue, bringing more abolitionist mps into the house of commons, including former military men who had personally experienced the horrors of slavery and slave revolts.
wilberforce was re-elected as an mp for yorkshire, after which he returned to finishing and publishing his letter, in reality a 400-page book which formed the basis for the final phase of the campaign.
lord grenville, the prime minister, was determined to introduce an abolition bill in the house of lords, rather than in the house of commons, taking it through its greatest challenge first.
when a final vote was taken, the bill was passed in the house of lords by a large margin.
sensing a breakthrough that had been long anticipated, charles grey moved for a second reading in the commons on 23 february 1807. as tributes were made to wilberforce, whose face streamed with tears, the bill was carried by 283 votes to 16. excited supporters suggested taking advantage of the large majority to seek the abolition of slavery itself, but wilberforce made it clear that total emancipation was not the immediate goal: "they had for the present no object immediately before them, but that of putting stop directly to the carrying of men in british ships to be sold as slaves."
the slave trade act received royal assent on 25 march 1807.
in his youth, william wilberforce showed little interest in women, but when he was in his late thirties his friend thomas babington recommended twenty-year-old barbara ann spooner (1777–1847) as a potential bride.
wilberforce met her two days later on 15 april 1797, and was immediately smitten; following an eight-day whirlwind romance, he proposed.
despite the urgings of friends to slow down, the couple married at the church of st swithin in bath, somerset, on 30 may 1797. they were devoted to each other, and barbara was very attentive and supportive to wilberforce in his increasing ill health, though she showed little interest in his political activities.
they had six children in fewer than ten years: william (born 1798), barbara (born 1799), elizabeth (born 1801), robert (born 1802), samuel (born 1805) and henry (born 1807).
wilberforce was an indulgent and adoring father who revelled in his time at home and at play with his children.
wilberforce was deeply conservative when it came to challenges to the existing political and social order.
he advocated change in society through christianity and improvement in morals, education and religion, fearing and opposing radical causes and revolution.
the radical            writer william cobbett was among those who attacked what they saw as wilberforce's hypocrisy in campaigning for better working conditions for slaves while british workers lived in terrible conditions at home.
"never have you done one single act, in favour of the labourers of this country", he wrote.
critics noted wilberforce's support of the suspension of habeas corpus in 1795 and his votes for pitt's "gagging bills", which banned meetings of more than 50 people, allowing speakers to be arrested and imposing harsh penalties on those who attacked the constitution.
wilberforce was opposed to giving workers' rights to organise into unions, in 1799 speaking in favour of the combination act, which suppressed trade union activity throughout britain, and calling unions "a general disease in our society".
he also opposed an enquiry into the 1819 peterloo massacre in which eleven protesters were killed at a political rally demanding reform.
concerned about "bad men who wished to produce anarchy and confusion", he approved of the government's six acts, which further limited public meetings and seditious writings.
wilberforce's actions led the essayist william hazlitt to condemn him as one "who preaches vital christianity to untutored savages, and tolerates its worst abuses in civilised states."
wilberforce's views of women and religion were also conservative.
he disapproved of women anti-slavery activists such as elizabeth heyrick, who organised women's abolitionist groups in the 1820s, protesting: "[f]or ladies to meet, to publish, to go from house to house stirring up petitions—these appear to me proceedings unsuited to the female character as delineated in scripture."
wilberforce initially strongly opposed bills for catholic emancipation, which would have allowed catholics to become mps, hold public office and serve in the army, although by 1813, he had changed his views and spoke in favour of a similar bill.
more progressively, wilberforce advocated legislation to improve the working conditions for chimney-sweeps and textile workers, engaged in prison reform, and supported campaigns to restrict capital punishment and the severe punishments meted out under the game laws.
he recognised the importance of education in alleviating poverty, and when hannah more and her sister established sunday schools for the poor in somerset and the mendips, he provided financial and moral support as they faced opposition from landowners and anglican clergy.
from the late 1780s onward, wilberforce campaigned for limited parliamentary reform, such as the abolition of rotten boroughs and the redistribution of commons seats to growing towns and cities, though by 1832, he feared that such measures went too far.
with others, wilberforce founded the world's first animal welfare organisation, the society for the prevention of cruelty to animals (later the royal society for the prevention of cruelty to animals).
in 1824, wilberforce was one of over 30 eminent gentlemen who put their names at the inaugural public meeting to the fledgling national institution for the preservation of life from shipwreck, later named the royal national lifeboat institution.
he was also opposed to duelling, which he described as the "disgrace of a christian society" and was appalled when his friend pitt engaged in a duel with george tierney in 1798, particularly as it occurred on a sunday, the christian day of rest.
wilberforce was generous with his time and money, believing that those with wealth had a duty to give a significant portion of their income to the needy.
yearly, he gave away thousands of pounds, much of it to clergymen to distribute in their parishes.
he paid off the debts of others, supported education and missions, and in a year of food shortages, gave to charity more than his own yearly income.
he was exceptionally hospitable, and could not bear to sack any of his servants.
as a result, his home was full of old and incompetent servants kept on in charity.
although he was often months behind in his correspondence, wilberforce responded to numerous requests for advice or for help in obtaining professorships, military promotions and livings for clergymen, or for the reprieve of death sentences.
a supporter of the evangelical wing of the church of england, wilberforce believed that the revitalisation of the church and individual christian observance would lead to a harmonious, moral society.
he sought to elevate the status of religion in public and private life, making piety fashionable in both the upper- and middle-classes of society.
to this end, in april 1797, wilberforce published a practical view of the prevailing religious system of professed christians in the higher and middle classes of this country contrasted with real christianity, on which he had been working since 1793. this was an exposition of new testament doctrine and teachings and a call for a revival of christianity, as a response to the moral decline of the nation, illustrating his own personal testimony and the views which inspired him.
the book proved to be influential and a best-seller by the standards of the day; 7,500 copies were sold within six months, and it was translated into several languages.
wilberforce fostered and supported missionary activity in britain and abroad.
he was a founding member of the church missionary society (since renamed the church mission society) and was involved, with other members of the clapham sect, in numerous other evangelical and charitable organisations.
horrified by the lack of christian evangelism in india, wilberforce used the 1793 renewal of the british east india company's charter to propose the addition of clauses requiring the company to provide teachers and chaplains and to commit to the "religious improvement" of indians.
the plan was unsuccessful due to lobbying by the directors of the company, who feared that their commercial interests would be damaged.
wilberforce tried again in 1813, when the charter next came up for renewal.
using petitions, meetings, lobbying and letter writing, he successfully campaigned for changes to the charter.
speaking in favour of the charter act 1813, he criticised the british in india for their hypocrisy and racial prejudice, while also condemning aspects of hinduism including the caste system, infanticide, polygamy and suttee.
"our religion is sublime, pure beneficent", he said, "theirs is mean, licentious and cruel".
greatly concerned by what he perceived to be the degeneracy of british society, wilberforce was also active in matters of moral reform, lobbying against "the torrent of profaneness that every day makes more rapid advances", and considered this issue and the abolition of the slave trade as equally important goals.
at the suggestion of wilberforce and bishop porteus, king george iii was requested by the archbishop of canterbury to issue in 1787 the proclamation for the discouragement of vice, as a remedy for the rising tide of immorality.
the proclamation commanded the prosecution of those guilty of "excessive drinking, blasphemy, profane swearing and cursing, lewdness, profanation of the lord's day, and other dissolute, immoral, or disorderly practices".
greeted largely with public indifference, wilberforce sought to increase its impact by mobilising public figures to the cause, and by founding the society for the suppression of vice.
this and other societies in which wilberforce was a prime mover, such as the proclamation society, mustered support for the prosecution of those who had been charged with violating relevant laws, including brothel keepers, distributors of pornographic material, and those who did not respect the sabbath.
years later, the writer and clergyman sydney smith criticised wilberforce for being more interested in the sins of the poor than those of the rich, and suggested that a better name would have been the society for "suppressing the vices of persons whose income does not exceed £500 per annum".
the societies were not highly successful in terms of membership and support, although their activities did lead to the imprisonment of thomas williams, the london printer of thomas paine's the age of reason.
wilberforce's attempts to legislate against adultery and sunday newspapers were also in vain; his involvement and leadership in other, less punitive, approaches were more successful in the long-term, however.
by the end of his life, british morals, manners, and sense of social responsibility had increased, paving the way for future changes in societal conventions and attitudes during the victorian era.
the hopes of the abolitionists notwithstanding, slavery did not wither with the end of the slave trade in the british empire, nor did the living conditions of the enslaved improve.
the trade continued, with few countries following suit by abolishing the trade, and with some british ships disregarding the legislation.
wilberforce worked with the members of the african institution to ensure the enforcement of abolition and to promote abolitionist negotiations with other countries.
in particular, the us had abolished the slave trade in 1808, and wilberforce lobbied the american government to enforce its own prohibition more strongly.
the same year, wilberforce moved his family from clapham to a sizable mansion with a large garden in kensington gore, closer to the houses of parliament.
never strong, and by 1812 in worsening health, wilberforce resigned his yorkshire seat, and became mp for the rotten borough of bramber in sussex, a seat with little or no constituency obligations, thus allowing him more time for his family and the causes that interested him.
from 1816 wilberforce introduced a series of bills which would require the compulsory registration of slaves, together with details of their country of origin, permitting the illegal importation of foreign slaves to be detected.
later in the same year he began publicly to denounce slavery itself, though he did not demand immediate emancipation, as "they had always thought the slaves incapable of liberty at present, but hoped that by degrees a change might take place as the natural result of the abolition."
in 1820, after a period of poor health, and with his eyesight failing, wilberforce took the decision to further limit his public activities, although he became embroiled in unsuccessful mediation attempts between king george iv, and his estranged wife caroline of brunswick, who had sought her rights as queen.
nevertheless, wilberforce still hoped "to lay a foundation for some future measures for the emancipation of the poor slaves", which he believed should come about gradually in stages.
aware that the cause would need younger men to continue the work, in 1821 he asked fellow mp thomas fowell buxton to take over leadership of the campaign in the commons.
as the 1820s wore on, wilberforce increasingly became a figurehead for the abolitionist movement, although he continued to appear at anti-slavery meetings, welcoming visitors, and maintaining a busy correspondence on the subject.
the year 1823 saw the founding of the society for the mitigation and gradual abolition of slavery (later the anti-slavery society), and the publication of wilberforce's 56-page appeal to the religion, justice and humanity of the inhabitants of the british empire in behalf of the negro slaves in the west indies.
in his treatise, wilberforce urged that total emancipation was morally and ethically required, and that slavery was a national crime that must be ended by parliamentary legislation to gradually abolish slavery.
members of parliament did not quickly agree, and government opposition in march 1823 stymied wilberforce's call for abolition.
on 15 may 1823, buxton moved another resolution in parliament for gradual emancipation.
subsequent debates followed on 16 march and 11 june 1824 in which wilberforce made his last speeches in the commons, and which again saw the emancipationists outmanoeuvred by the government.
wilberforce's health was continuing to fail, and he suffered further illnesses in 1824 and 1825. with his family concerned that his life was endangered, he declined a peerage and resigned his seat in parliament, leaving the campaign in the hands of others.
thomas clarkson continued to travel, visiting anti-slavery groups throughout britain, motivating activists and acting as an ambassador for the anti-slavery cause to other countries, while buxton pursued the cause of reform in parliament.
public meetings and petitions demanding emancipation continued, with an increasing number supporting immediate abolition rather than the gradual approach favoured by wilberforce, clarkson and their colleagues.
in 1826, wilberforce moved from his large house in kensington gore to highwood hill, a more modest property in the countryside of mill hill, north of london, where he was soon joined by his son william and family.
william had attempted a series of educational and career paths, and a venture into farming in 1830 led to huge losses, which his father repaid in full, despite offers from others to assist.
this left wilberforce with little income, and he was obliged to let his home and spend the rest of his life visiting family members and friends.
he continued his support for the anti-slavery cause, including attending and chairing meetings of the anti-slavery society.
wilberforce approved of the 1830 election victory of the more progressive whigs, though he was concerned about the implications of their reform bill which proposed the redistribution of parliamentary seats towards newer towns and cities and an extension of the franchise.
in the event, the reform act 1832 was to bring more abolitionist mps into parliament as a result of intense and increasing public agitation against slavery.
in addition, the 1832 slave revolt in jamaica convinced government ministers that abolition was essential to avoid further rebellion.in 1833, wilberforce's health declined further and he suffered a severe attack of influenza from which he never fully recovered.
he made a final anti-slavery speech in april 1833 at a public meeting in maidstone, kent.
the following month, the whig government introduced the bill for the abolition of slavery, formally saluting wilberforce in the process.
on 26 july 1833, wilberforce heard of government concessions that guaranteed the passing of the bill for the abolition of slavery.
the following day he grew much weaker, and he died early on the morning of 29 july at his cousin's house in cadogan place, london.
one month later, the house of lords passed the slavery abolition act, which abolished slavery in most of the british empire from august 1834. they voted plantation owners £20 million in compensation, giving full emancipation to children younger than six, and instituting a system of apprenticeship requiring other enslaved peoples to work for their former masters for four to six years in the british west indies, south africa, mauritius, british honduras and canada.
nearly 800,000 african slaves were freed, the vast majority in the caribbean.
wilberforce had requested that he was to be buried with his sister and daughter at stoke newington, just north of london.
however, the leading members of both houses of parliament urged that he be honoured with a burial in westminster abbey.
the family agreed and, on 3 august 1833, wilberforce was buried in the north transept, close to his friend william pitt the younger.
the funeral was attended by many members of parliament, as well as by members of the public.
the pallbearers included the duke of gloucester, the lord chancellor henry brougham and the speaker of the house of commons charles manners-sutton.
while tributes were paid and wilberforce was laid to rest, both houses of parliament suspended their business as a mark of respect.
five years after his death, sons robert and samuel wilberforce published a five-volume biography about their father, and subsequently a collection of his letters in 1840. the biography was controversial in that the authors emphasised wilberforce's role in the abolition movement and played down the important work of thomas clarkson.
incensed, clarkson came out of retirement to write a book refuting their version of events, and the sons eventually made a half-hearted private apology to him and removed the offending passages in a revision of their biography.
however, for more than a century, wilberforce's role in the campaign dominated the history books.
later historians have noted the warm and highly productive relationship between clarkson and wilberforce, and have termed it one of history's great partnerships: without both the parliamentary leadership supplied by wilberforce and the research and public mobilisation organised by clarkson, abolition could not have been achieved.
as his sons had desired and planned, wilberforce has long been viewed as a christian hero, a statesman-saint held up as a role model for putting his faith into action.
more broadly, he has also been described as a humanitarian reformer who contributed significantly to reshaping the political and social attitudes of the time by promoting concepts of social responsibility and action.
in the 1940s, the role of wilberforce and the clapham sect in abolition was downplayed by historian eric williams, who argued that abolition was motivated not by humanitarianism but by economics, as the west indian sugar industry was in decline.
williams' approach strongly influenced historians for much of the latter part of the 20th century.
however, more recent historians have noted that the sugar industry was still making large profits at the time of the abolition of the slave trade, and this has led to a renewed interest in wilberforce and the evangelicals, as well as a recognition of the anti-slavery movement as a prototype for subsequent humanitarian campaigns.
wilberforce's life and work have been widely commemorated.
in westminster abbey, a seated statue of wilberforce by samuel joseph was erected in 1840, bearing an epitaph praising his christian character and his long labour to abolish the slave trade and slavery itself.
in wilberforce's home town of hull, a public subscription in 1834 funded the wilberforce monument, a 31-metre (102 ft) greek doric column topped by a statue of wilberforce, which now stands in the grounds of hull college near queen's gardens.
wilberforce's birthplace was acquired by the city corporation in 1903 and, following renovation, wilberforce house in hull was opened as britain's first slavery museum.
wilberforce memorial school for the blind in york was established in 1833 in his honour, and in 2006 the university of hull established the wilberforce institute for the study of slavery and emancipation in oriel chambers, a building adjoining wilberforce's birthplace.various churches within the anglican communion commemorate wilberforce in their liturgical calendars, and wilberforce university in ohio, united states, founded in 1856, is named after him.
the university was the first owned by african-american people, and is a historically black college.
in ontario, canada, wilberforce colony was founded by black reformers, and inhabited by free slaves from the united states.
amazing grace, a film about wilberforce and the struggle against the slave trade, directed by michael apted and starring ioan gruffudd and benedict cumberbatch was released in 2007 to coincide with the 200th anniversary of parliament's anti-slave trade legislation.
a monument is a type of—usually three-dimensional—structure that was explicitly created to commemorate a person or event, or which has become relevant to a social group as a part of their remembrance of historic times or cultural heritage, due to its artistic, historical, political, technical or architectural importance.
some of the first monuments were dolmens or menhirs, megalithic constructions built for religious or funerary purposes.
examples of monuments include statues, (war) memorials, historical buildings, archaeological sites, and cultural assets.
if there is a public interest in its preservation, a monument can for example be listed as a unesco world heritage site.
the origin of the word "monument" comes from the greek mnemosynon and the latin moneo, monere, which means 'to remind', 'to advise' or 'to warn', suggesting a monument allows us to see the past thus helping us visualize what is to come in the future.
in english the word "monumental" is often used in reference to something of extraordinary size and power, as in monumental sculpture, but also to mean simply anything made to commemorate the dead, as a funerary monument or other example of funerary art.
monuments have been created for thousands of years, and they are often the most durable and famous symbols of ancient civilizations.
prehistoric tumuli, dolmens, and similar structures have been created in a large number of prehistoric cultures across the world, and the many forms of monumental tombs of the more wealthy and powerful members of a society are often the source of much of our information and art from those cultures.
as societies became organized on a larger scale, so monuments so large as to be difficult to destroy like the egyptian pyramids, the greek parthenon, the great wall of china, indian taj mahal or the moai of easter island have become symbols of their civilizations.
in more recent times, monumental structures such as the statue of liberty and eiffel tower have become iconic emblems of modern nation-states.
the term monumentality relates to the symbolic status and physical presence of a monument.
in this context, german art historian helmut scharf states that “a monument exists in the form of an object and also as symbol thereof.
as a language symbol, a monument usually refers to something concrete, in some rare cases it is also used metaphorically .... a monument can be a language symbol for a unity of several monuments ... or only for a single one, but in a broader sense it can also be used in nearly all knowable planes of being.
... what is considered a monument always depends on the importance it attributes to the prevailing or traditional consciousness of a specific historical and social situation.”
basically, the definition framework of the term monument depends on the current historical frame conditions.
aspects of the culture of remembrance and cultural memory are also linked to it, as well as questions about the concepts of public sphere and durability (of the one memorized) and the form and content of the monument (work-like monument).
from an art historical point of view, the dichotomy of content and form opens up the problem of the “linguistic ability” of the monument.
it becomes clear that language is an eminent part of a monument and it is often represented in “non-objective” or “architectural monuments”, at least with a plaque.
in this connection, the debate touches on the social mechanisms that combine with remembrance.
these are acceptance of the monument as an object, the conveyed contents and the impact of these contents.
monuments are frequently used to improve the appearance of a city or location.
planned cities such as washington d.c., new delhi and brasília are often built around monuments.
for example, the washington monument's location was conceived by l'enfant to help organize public space in the city, before it was designed or constructed.
older cities have monuments placed at locations that are already important or are sometimes redesigned to focus on one.
as shelley suggested in his famous poem "ozymandias" ("look on my works, ye mighty, and despair!
"), the purpose of monuments is very often to impress or awe.
structures created for others purposes that have been made notable by their age, size or historic significance may also be regarded as monuments.
this can happen because of great age and size, as in the case of the great wall of china, or because an event of great importance occurred there such as the village of oradour-sur-glane in france.
many countries use ancient monument or similar terms for the official designation of protected structures or archeological sites which may originally have been ordinary domestic houses or other buildings.
monuments are also often designed to convey historical or political information, and they can thus develop an active socio-political potency.
they can be used to reinforce the primacy of contemporary political power, such as the column of trajan or the numerous statues of lenin in the soviet union.
they can be used to educate the populace about important events or figures from the past, such as in the renaming of the old general post office building in new york city to the james a. farley building (james farley post office), after former postmaster general james farley.
to fulfill its informative and educative functions a monument needs to be open to the public, which means that its spatial dimension as well as its content can be experienced by the public, and be sustainable.
the former may be achieved either by situating the monument in public space or by a public discussion about the monument and its meaning, the latter by the materiality of the monument or if its content immediately becomes part of the collective or cultural memory.
the social meanings of monuments are rarely fixed and certain and are frequently 'contested' by different social groups.
as an example: whilst the former east german socialist state may have seen the berlin wall as a means of 'protection' from the ideological impurity of the west, dissidents and others would often argue that it was symbolic of the inherent repression and paranoia of that state.
this contention of meaning is a central theme of modern 'post processual' archaeological discourse.
the term is often used to describe any structure that is a significant and legally protected historic work, and many countries have equivalents of what is called in united kingdom legislation a scheduled monument, which often include relatively recent buildings constructed for residential or industrial purposes, with no thought at the time that they would come to be regarded as "monuments".
until recently, it was customary for archaeologists to study large monuments and pay less attention to the everyday lives of the societies that created them.
new ideas about what constitutes the archaeological record have revealed that certain legislative and theoretical approaches to the subject are too focused on earlier definitions of monuments.
an example has been the united kingdom's scheduled ancient monument laws.
other than municipal or national government that protecting the monuments in their jurisdiction, there are institutions dedicated on the efforts to protect and preserve monuments that considered to possess special natural or cultural significance for the world, such as unesco's world heritage site programme and world monuments fund.
cultural monuments are also considered to be the memory of a community and are therefore particularly at risk in the context of modern asymmetrical warfare.
the enemy's cultural heritage is to be sustainably damaged or even destroyed.
in addition to the national protection of cultural monuments, international organizations (cf.
unesco world heritage, blue shield international) therefore try to protect cultural monuments.
recently, more and more monuments are being preserved digitally (in 3d models) through organisations as cyark.

the monument to the great fire of london, more commonly known simply as the monument, is a doric column in london, united kingdom, situated near the northern end of london bridge.
commemorating the great fire of london, it stands at the junction of monument street and fish street hill, 202 feet (62 m) in height and 202 feet west of the spot in pudding lane where the great fire started on 2 september 1666. constructed between 1671 and 1677, it was built on the site of st. margaret's, fish street, the first church to be destroyed by the great fire.
it is grade i listed and is a scheduled monument.
another monument, the golden boy of pye corner, marks the point near smithfield where the fire was stopped.
the monument comprises a fluted doric column built of portland stone topped with a gilded urn of fire.
it was designed by christopher wren and robert hooke.
its height marks its distance from the site of the shop of thomas farriner (or farynor), the king's baker, where the blaze began.
the viewing platform near the top of the monument is reached by a narrow winding staircase of 311 steps.
a mesh cage was added in the mid-19th century to prevent people jumping to the ground, after six people had committed suicide there between 1788 and 1842.
three sides of the base carry inscriptions in latin.
the one on the south side describes actions taken by king charles ii following the fire.
the inscription on the east side describes how the monument was started and brought to perfection, and under which mayors.
inscriptions on the north side describe how the fire started, how much damage it caused, and how it was eventually extinguished.
the latin words "sed furor papisticus qui tamdiu patravit nondum restingvitur" (but popish frenzy, which wrought such horrors, is not yet quenched) were added to the end of the inscription on the orders of the court of aldermen in 1681 during the foment of the popish plot.
text on the east side originally falsely blamed roman catholics for the fire ("burning of this protestant city, begun and carried on by the treachery and malice of the popish faction"), which  prompted alexander pope (himself a catholic) to say of the area:
where london's column, pointing at the skies,like a tall bully, lifts the head, and lies.– moral essays, epistle iii.
line 339 (1733–1734).
the words blaming catholics were chiselled out with catholic emancipation in 1830.
the west side of the base displays a sculpture, by caius gabriel cibber, in alto and bas relief, of the destruction of the city; with charles ii and his brother, james, the duke of york (later king james ii), surrounded by liberty, architecture, and science, giving directions for its restoration.
it gives its name to the nearby london underground station, monument.
the first rebuilding act, passed in 1669, stipulated that "the better to preserve the memory of this dreadful visitation", a column of either brass or stone should be set up on fish street hill, on or near the site of farynor's bakery, where the fire began.
christopher wren, as surveyor-general of the king's works, was asked to submit a design.
wren worked with robert hooke on the design.
it is impossible to disentangle the collaboration between hooke and wren, but hooke's drawings of possible designs for the column still exist, with wren's signature on them indicating his approval of the drawings rather than their authorship.
it was not until 1671 that the city council approved the design, and it took six years to complete the 202 ft column.
it was two more years before the inscription (which had been left to wren — or to wren's choice — to decide upon) was set in place.
"commemorating — with a brazen disregard for the truth — the fact that 'london rises again...three short years complete that which was considered the work of ages.'"
hooke's surviving drawings show that several versions of the monument were submitted for consideration: a plain obelisk, a column garnished with tongues of fire, and the fluted doric column that was eventually chosen.
the real contention came with the problem of what type of ornament to have at the top.
initially, wren favoured a statue of a phoenix with outstretched wings rising from the ashes, but as the column neared completion he decided instead on a 15 ft statue either of charles ii, or a sword-wielding female to represent a triumphant london; the cost of either being estimated at £1,050.
charles himself disliked the idea of his statue atop the monument and instead preferred a simple copper-gilded ball "with flames sprouting from the top", costing a little over £325, but ultimately it was the design of a flaming gilt-bronze urn suggested by robert hooke that was chosen.
the total cost of the monument was £13,450 11s 9d., of which £11,300 was paid to the mason-contractor joshua marshall.
(joshua marshall was master of the worshipful company of masons in 1670.)
the edinburgh-born writer james boswell visited the monument in 1763 to climb the 311 steps to what was then the highest viewpoint in london.
halfway up, he suffered a panic attack, but persevered and made it to the top, where he found it "horrid to be so monstrous a way up in the air, so far above london and all its spires".
the area around the base of the column, monument street, was pedestrianised in 2006 in a £790,000 street improvement scheme.
the monument closed in july 2007 for an 18-month, £4.5 million refurbishment project and re-opened in february 2009.

between 1 and 2 october 2011, a live music sculpture created especially for the monument by british composer samuel bordoli was performed 18 times during the weekend.
this was the first occasion that music had ever been heard inside the structure and effectively transformed wren's design into a gigantic reverberating musical instrument.
wren and hooke built the monument to double-up as a scientific instrument.
it has a central shaft meant for use as a zenith telescope and for use in gravity and pendulum experiments that connects to an underground laboratory for observers to work (accessible through a hatch in the floor of the present-day ticket booth).
vibrations from heavy traffic on fish street hill rendered the experimental conditions unsuitable.
at the top of the monument, a hinged lid in the urn covers the opening to the shaft.
the steps in the shaft of the tower are all six inches high, allowing them to be used for barometric pressure studies.
more recently, researchers from queen mary's university of london used the shaft of the monument stairwell to measure deformation in a hanging wire.
by twisting and untwisting a wire hanging down the shaft of the stairwell, they were able to detect deformation at less than 9 parts per billion - equivalent to a one degree twist over the length of the 50 meter wire.
during the 2007–2009 refurbishment, a 360-degree panoramic camera was installed on top of the monument.
updated every minute and running 24 hours a day, it provides a record of weather, building and ground activity in the city.
if the day were bright, you observed upon the house–tops, stretching far away, a long dark path; the shadow of the monument; and turning round, the tall original was close beside you, with every hair erect upon his golden head, as if the doings of the city frightened him.

the restored temple is erected in reduced size by recreating cella (grabhagriha) inside the original shrine proper (mulaprasada) which can be identified by partially surviving pitha or plinth.
the pitha is three buttressed.
the sculptures of the jangha of the mandovara (middle part of temple) had dikpalas, vyalas and apsaras.
the pillars were eight sided at the base, sixteen sided in middle and circular at the top.
the pillars supported flat ceiling.

the hidimba temple is north of it.
it is a temple with three entrances which has only its lowest part surviving thus nothing definite can be said except the floor plan.
the image of the large feet in the temple is popularly associated with hidimba, the demoness wife of bhima.
the scale of the feet suggests that they were brought from somewhere else and installed here.
the forest is called hidimba van after her.

it was repaired with new masonry in 1973 by the archeological survey of india.
there are two wells located north and east of it.
there are two stepwells; sasu ni vav and vahu ni vav in the north-west of kund.
they were built by a mother-in-law and her daughter-in-law according to a myth which may not be historically true.
the legend says that the mother-in-law denied water to her daughter-in-law from her stepwell so the daughter-in-law built her own stepwell.
she built a longer but narrower stepwell which offended her mother-in-law so she cursed the water with impurity.
these stepwells were built in the nanda style in the 14th or 15th century and have exquisitely carved sculptures.
their iconography resembles that of rani ki vav so these stepwells may belong to the 10th century also.
sasu ni vav is broader while vahu ni vav is narrower.
the stepwells have four kutas (pavilion towers) and four mandapas supported by four pilasters without any pillars.
the pilasters have monolithic shafts and are of ruchaka type.

the west wall of the first kuta has dashavatara.
the second kuta has a sculpture of sheshayin vishnu on the right while saptamatrika is on the left.
it has carved shaft brackets and is deeper than the other stepwell suggesting the underground flow following the slope of the site.
the lower two kuta are narrower than the previous ones.

the tomb of anarkali (urdu: مقبره انارکلی‎) is an octagonal 16th century mughal monument in lahore, capital of the pakistani province of punjab.
the tomb of anarkali is located on the grounds of lahore's punjab civil secretariat complex near the british-era mall, southwest of the walled city of lahore.
it is considered to be one of the earliest mughal tombs still in existence, and is considered to be one of the most significant buildings of the early mughal period.
the building is currently used as the punjab archives, and public access is limited.
construction of the tomb dates to either 1599 c.e., or 1615 c.e.
the tomb was said to be built by the mughal emperor jehangir for his love anarkali, as per legend, was caught by emperor akbar for exchanging glances with jehangir, at the time known as prince saleem.
anarkali was reportedly a concubine of emperor akbar, and this action reportedly enraged the emperor akbar so much, that he had anarkali interred alive in a wall.
when prince saleem ascended the throne and took the name "jehangir," he is reported to have ordered the construction of a tomb over the site of the wall in which anarkali was reportedly buried.
eighteenth-century historian abdullah chagatai reported that the tomb was not the resting place for anarkali, but instead for jehangir's beloved wife sahib-i-jamal begum.
many modern historians accept the credulity of this account.
the building is currently used as the punjab archives, so access to the public is limited.
during the time of the sikh empire, the tomb was occupied by kharak singh, and later was further desecrated by its conversion into the residence for the wife of general jean-baptiste ventura, who was employed in the army of ranjit singh.
the tomb was then converted during the british raj into clerical offices in 1847 before repurposing the tomb into the anglican st. james church in 1851, and later regarded as lahore's "protestant cathedral."
in 1891, the church congregation was relocated, and the tomb was repurposed as the punjab record office.
the occupant's cenotaph was removed when the tomb was repurposed into a church.
when the building no longer served as a church, the cenotaph was placed at the site of the former altar, and not at the original site of the cenotaph.
the structure's foundation are in the basic shape of an octagon, with alternating measurements of 44 feet and 30 feet for each side with semi-octagonal towers at each corner.
the structure is also topped by a double-dome, and is one of the earlier examples of such a dome from the mughal era.
the dome rests upon 8 arches, each measuring 12 feet 3 inches.
the large arches in the sides of the building were once open in typical mughal fashion, but were blocked off by the british.
the building is today covered in whitewashing.
it was reportedly once surrounded by a garden.
the building is currently used as the punjab archives, so access to the public is limited.
the white marble cenotaph features carvings with the 99 names of allah, and was described by 19th-century historians as "one of the finest pieces of carving in the world."
in addition to the 99 names of allah, the cenotaph is inscribed with a persian couplet written by the emperor jehangir which reads: "ah!
could i behold the face of my beloved once more, i would give thanks unto my god until the day of resurrection."
the tomb is listed on the protected heritage monuments of the archaeology department of punjab.
the tomb of dai anga (urdu: مقبرہ دائی انگہ‎), also known as the gulabi bagh (urdu: گلابی باغ‎), is a 17th-century mughal tomb complex located in the mughal-era suburb of begampura, outside the walled city of lahore, pakistan.
the mausoleum was built in honour of dai anga, the wet nurse of shah jahan, and wife of murad khan of bikaner.
it is located along the grand trunk road on one of the former routes between lahore and delhi.
it is also located close to the 17th century tomb of hazrat ishaan, and the 18th century cypress tomb.
the tomb of dai anga features a gateway that predates the tomb's construction.
built in 1655 c.e.
by the persian nobleman mirza sultan baig, the gateway was originally the entrance to a pleasure garden.
the original garden was square in shape, and had measured 250 guz on each side.
in 1671 c.e., the pleasure garden was repurposed into a tomb for the wet-nurse of the mughal emperor shah jahan, and wife to murad khan, magistrate of bikaner under the emperor jehangir.
a new mausoleum was constructed in the centre of the garden, which over the centuries has been encroached upon by neighbouring structures, with only a narrow strip of garden between the tomb and gateway remaining.
the mausoleum is rectangular in shape with eight rooms encircling the perimeter of a central chamber.
the entire mausoleum is on a raised plinth.
a dome with frescoes is directly above the central chamber.
the chamber itself is empty, as the actual tomb of dai anga lies below in a subterranean crypt.
she is buried next to her daughter sultana begum.
both cenotaphs have been removed, and the subterranean chamber is no longer accessible to the public.
the central change is richly decorated with carved inscriptions from the quran, as well as elegant frescoes made by the renowned calligrapher muhammad saleh.
the exterior of the tomb was also once covered in rich kashi kari, or qashani tile-work, though much of the tiles have been lost through the centuries.
the tomb complex is listed on the protected heritage monuments of the archaeology department of punjab.
the tomb is situated along the planned route of the orange line of the lahore metro.
heritage campaigners submitted a petition to the lahore high court as the planned metro line will pass close to the tomb, shalimar gardens, and nine other sites in the city in violation of the punjab special premises ordinance, 1985 and antiquity act, 1975. in august 2016, the court halted construction of the metro within 200 feet of any heritage site, including the tomb in order to prevent what unesco termed as potentially "irreversible damage," were the line to be constructed in its present form.
the ceiling of the tomb is embellished with mughal frescoes.
the interior of the tomb was richly decorated with stone-carvings, tile work, and frescoes.
the corners of the mausoleum are topped by towers.
the bases of the towers feature mosaic work.
the towers at the corners of the tomb still has some kashi kari tile work.

atatürk (1881–1938) was the founder of the turkish republic.
he was also the high commander of the turkish army in the turkish war of independence (1919–1923).
şerife bacı (literally sister şerife) (1900–1921) was a heroine in the turkish war of independence.
she was a village woman from seydiler, who took part in the arms transportation service.
any weapon or ammunition from i̇stanbul to i̇nebolu port  (kastamonu province) had to be forwarded to ankara by ox wagons (turkish: kağnı).
since most of the men were drafted women were responsible in transportation.
in 1921 december şerife with her new born baby volunteered to drive a wagon in the convoy.

the thousand-buddha cliff (chinese: 千佛崖; pinyin: qiānfó yá) is a historical site of mostly tang dynasty rock carvings in central shandong province, china.
along a cliff face of 63 meters length, over 210 statues and 43 inscriptions have been reported.
most of the statues were carved during 618–684.
the thousand-buddha cliff is located near liubu village, in licheng district, under the administration of jinan city, about 33 kilometres southeast of the city of jinan proper and eight kilometres east of zhonggong town.
it stands immediately to the west of the site of the former shentong temple (chinese: 神通寺; pinyin: shéntōng sì, meaning "supernatural power" temple), which is now in ruins.
the cliff is oriented in the north–south direction.
coordinates: 36°29′23″n 117°06′26″e  /  36.48972°n 117.10722°e  / 36.48972; 117.10722
the first buddha sculpture is said to have been carved into the cliff by a 70-year-old monk named sha dong in the year 619 ad.
after a hiatus of 25 years, two more buddhist sculptures were added by another old monk named ming de.
because ming de felt his life was coming to an end at the time, he also donated money towards the carving of additional statues.
however, in the year 657 ad he was still alive and continued to carve more statues and inscriptions into the rock face.
because the tang dynasty's official policy during the time was to encourage conversion to taoism, the carving of buddhist statues implied a political risk.
hence, the inscriptions left by sha dong and ming de point out that the sole purpose of the statues was prayer and not the expression of political opinions.
despite these difficulties, the work of carving the sculptures into the cliff was continued by other buddhists and eventually the thousand-buddha cliff became the largest collection of buddhist cliff statues in shandong.
besides the buddhist sculptures, there are also secular statues depicting nobility such as relatives of the emperor, government officials, and famous monks.
among those are statues of princess nanping (南平公主), the daughter of emperor taizong of tang and her husband liu xuanyi.

monument to women memorial garden is a statuary monument in nauvoo, illinois, owned by the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints (lds church).
the monument is a two-acre garden with twelve statues depicting traditional women's roles.
it was constructed in the 1970s to serve as a replacement for the relief society monument and designed to promote the woman's values which the lds church believed were threatened by the equal rights amendment (era).

war memorials for the franco-prussian war (1870–71) were the first in europe to have rank-and-file soldiers commemorated by name.
every soldier that was killed was granted a permanent resting-place as part of the terms of the treaty of frankfurt (1871).
to commemorate the millions who died in world war i, war memorials became commonplace in communities large and small around the world.
[citation needed]
in modern times the main intent of war memorials is not to glorify war, but to honor those who have died.
sometimes, as in the case of the warsaw genuflection of willy brandt, they may also serve as focal points of increasing understanding between previous enemies.
using modern technology an international project is currently archiving all post-1914 commonwealth war graves and commonwealth war graves commission memorials to create a virtual memorial (see the war graves photographic project for further details).
during wwi, many nations saw massive devastation and loss of life.
more people lost their lives in the east than in the west, but the outcome was different.
in the west, and in response to the victory there obtained, most of the cities in the countries involved in the conflict erected memorials, with the memorials in smaller villages and towns often listing the names of each local soldier who had been killed in addition (so far as the decision by the french and british in 1916 to construct governmentally designed cemeteries was concerned) to their names being recorded on military headstones, often against the will of those directly involved, and without any opportunity of choice in the british empire (imperial war graves commission).
massive british monuments commemorating thousands of dead with no identified war grave, such as the menin gate at ypres and the thiepval memorial on the somme, were also constructed.
the liberty memorial, located in kansas city, missouri, is a memorial dedicated to all americans who served in the great war.
for various reasons connected with their character, the same may be said to apply to certain governmental memorials in the united kingdom (the cenotaph in london, relating to the empire in general, and the scottish national war memorial in edinburgh, also with a reference to the empire, but with particular connections to the united kingdom, having been opened by the prince of wales in 1927 and with the king and the queen the first visitors and contributors of a casket of the scottish names for addition within the shrine).
in maryland, in the center of the city of baltimore facing the baltimore city hall to the west is a geometric paved tree-lined plaza with the war memorial building to the east with a large marble decorated civic auditorium and historical and veterans museum below, designed by laurence hall fowler, dedicated 1925.
after world war i, some towns in france set up pacifist war memorials.
instead of commemorating the glorious dead, these memorials denounce war with figures of grieving widows and children rather than soldiers.
such memorials provoked anger among veterans and the military in general.
the most famous is at gentioux-pigerolles in the department of creuse.
below the column which lists the name of the fallen stands an orphan in bronze pointing to an inscription 'maudite soit la guerre' (cursed be war).
feelings ran so high that the memorial was not officially inaugurated until 1990 and soldiers at the nearby army camp were under orders to turn their heads when they walked past.
another such memorial is in the small town of équeurdreville-hainneville (formerly équeurdreville) in the department of manche.
here the statue is of a grieving widow with two small children.
there seems to be no exact equivalent form of a pacifist memorial within the united kingdom but evidently sentiments were in many cases identical.
thus, and although it seems that this has never been generally recognized, it can be argued that there was throughout the united kingdom a construction of war memorials with reference to the concept of peace (e.g.
west hartlepool war memorial in what is now known as hartlepool (previously west hartlepool) with the inscription 'thine o lord is the victory' relating to amongst other architecture the 1871 royal albert hall of arts and sciences with a frieze including the same words and concluding 'glory be to god on high and on earth peace').
in many cases, world war i memorials were later extended to show the names of locals who died in the world war ii in addition.
since that time memorials to the dead in other conflicts such as the korean war and vietnam war have also noted individual contributions, at least in the west.
in relation to actions which may well in point of fact be historically connected with the world wars even if this happens, for whatever reason, not to be a matter of general discussion (e.g.
occupation by western forces in the 1920s of palestine and other areas being the homelands of arabs in the near east and followed eighty years later in 2001 by the '9/11' raid on new york and elsewhere in the united states) similar historically and architecturally significant memorials are also designed and constructed (vide national september 11 memorial).
a tank monument or armoured memorial is a tank withdrawn from military service and displayed to commemorate a battle or a military unit.
obsolete tanks may also be displayed as gate guards outside military bases.
immediately following the first world war, a number of obsolete tanks were presented to towns and cities throughout britain for display and for use as memorials: most were scrapped in the 1920s and 1930s, but one that survives is a mark iv female tank at ashford, kent.
several second world war tanks are preserved as memorials to major armoured offensives in the ardennes, such as the battle of sedan and the battle of the bulge.
these include:
a plinth-mounted t-35/85 tank commemorates the soldiers of the 5th guards tank army, at znamianka in ukraine.
many cemeteries tended by the commonwealth war graves commission have an identical war memorial called the cross of sacrifice designed by sir reginald blomfield that varies in height from 18 ft to 32 ft depending on the size of the cemetery.
if there are one thousand or more burials, a commonwealth cemetery will contain a stone of remembrance, designed by sir edwin lutyens with words from the wisdom of sirach: "their name liveth for evermore"; all the stones of remembrance are 11 ft 6 ins long and 5 ft high with three steps leading up to them.
arlington national cemetery has a canadian cross of sacrifice with the names of all the citizens of the usa who lost their lives fighting in the canadian forces during the korean war and two world wars.
war memorials can sometimes be politically controversial.
a notable case is that of the yasukuni shrine in japan, where a number of convicted world war ii war criminals are interred.
chinese and korean representatives have often protested against the visits of japanese politicians to the shrine.
the visits have in the past led to severe diplomatic conflicts between the nations, and japanese businesses were attacked in china after a visit by former japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi to the shrine was widely reported and criticized in chinese and korean media.
in a similar case, former german chancellor helmut kohl was criticised by writers günter grass and elie wiesel for visiting the war cemetery at bitburg (in the company of ronald reagan) which also contained the bodies of ss troops.
unlike the case of the yasukuni shrine, there was no element of intentional disregard of international opinion involved, as is often claimed for the politician visits to the japanese shrine.
soviet world war ii memorials included quotes of joseph stalin's texts, frequently replaced after his death.
such memorials were often constructed in city centres and now are sometimes regarded as symbols of soviet occupation and removed, which in turn may spark protests (see bronze soldier of tallinn).
the fusiliers' memorial arch to the royal dublin fusiliers who fought in the boer war, erected at 1907 in st. stephen's green, dublin, was called "traitors' gate" by the redmondites and later irish republicans, from whose point of view irish soldiers going off to fight the british empire's wars were traitors to ireland.
the sharpness of the controversy gradually faded, and while the term "traitors' gate" is still in occasional colloquial use in dublin daily life, it has mostly lost its pejorative meaning.
in australia, in 1981, historian henry reynolds raised the issue of whether war memorials should be erected to indigenous australians who had died fighting against british invaders on their lands.
how, then, do we deal with the aboriginal dead?
white australians frequently say that 'all that' should be forgotten.
but it will not be.
it cannot be.
black memories are too deeply, too recently scarred.
and forgetfulness is a strange prescription coming from a community which has revered the fallen warrior and emblazoned the phrase 'lest we forget' on monuments throughout the land.
[...] [d]o we make room for the aboriginal dead on our memorials, cenotaphs, boards of honour and even in the pantheon of national heroes?
if we are to continue to celebrate the sacrifice of men and women who died for their country can we deny admission to fallen tribesmen?
there is much in their story that australians have traditionally admired.
they were ever the underdogs, were always outgunned, yet frequently faced death without flinching.
if they did not die for australia as such they fell defending their homelands, their sacred sites, their way of life.
what is more the blacks bled on their own soil and not half a world away furthering the strategic objectives of a distant motherland whose influence must increasingly be seen as of transient importance in the history of the continent.
reynolds' suggestion proved controversial.
occasional memorials have been erected to commemorate aboriginal people's resistance to colonisation, or to commemorate white massacres of indigenous australians.
these memorials have often generated controversy.
for example, a 1984 memorial to the kalkadoon people's "resistance against the paramilitary force of european settlers and the queensland native mounted police" was "frequently shot at" and "eventually blown up".
with the advent of long war, some memorials are constructed before the conflict is over, leaving space for extra names of the dead.
for instance, the northwood gratitude and honor memorial in irvine, ca, memorializes an ongoing pair of us wars, and has space to inscribe the names of approximately 8,000 fallen servicemembers, while the uk national memorial arboretum near lichfield in england hosts the uk's national armed forces memorial which displays the names of the more than 16,000 people who have already died on active service in the uk armed forces since world war ii, with more space available for future fatalities.
the following is a list of some notable war memorials.

patrick hillery represented the irish government at the 1966 golden jubilee commemoration in 1966, reviewing the troops who participated in the ceremony.however, by 2006, the memorial was in need of maintenance work, and sinn féin representatives were critical of the local authority, saying that the monument was in "a shocking state of disrepair".
farhad and shirin monument (turkish: ferhat ile şirin heykeli) is a monument atop a rocky hill in amasya, northern turkey dedicated to the story about the tragic romance between farhad and shirin.

a dream is a succession of images, ideas, emotions, and sensations that usually occur involuntarily in the mind during certain stages of sleep.
the content and purpose of dreams are not fully understood, although they have been a topic of scientific, philosophical and religious interest throughout recorded history.
dream interpretation is the attempt at drawing meaning from dreams and searching for an underlying message.
the scientific study of dreams is called oneirology.
dreams mainly occur in the rapid-eye movement (rem) stage of sleep—when brain activity is high and resembles that of being awake.
rem sleep is revealed by continuous movements of the eyes during sleep.
at times, dreams may occur during other stages of sleep.
however, these dreams tend to be much less vivid or memorable.
the length of a dream can vary; they may last for a few seconds, or approximately 20–30 minutes.
people are more likely to remember the dream if they are awakened during the rem phase.
the average person has three to five dreams per night, and some may have up to seven; however, most dreams are immediately or quickly forgotten.
dreams tend to last longer as the night progresses.
during a full eight-hour night sleep, most dreams occur in the typical two hours of rem.
dreams related to waking-life experiences are associated with rem theta activity, which suggests that emotional memory processing takes place in rem sleep.
opinions about the meaning of dreams have varied and shifted through time and culture.
many endorse the freudian theory of dreams – that dreams reveal insight into hidden desires and emotions.
[qualify evidence] other prominent theories include those suggesting that dreams assist in memory formation, problem solving, or simply are a product of random brain activation.
sigmund freud, who developed the psychological discipline of psychoanalysis, wrote extensively about dream theories and their interpretations in the early 1900s.
he explained dreams as manifestations of one's deepest desires and anxieties, often relating to repressed childhood memories or obsessions.
furthermore, he believed that virtually every dream topic, regardless of its content, represented the release of sexual tension.
in the interpretation of dreams (1899), freud developed a psychological technique to interpret dreams and devised a series of guidelines to understand the symbols and motifs that appear in our dreams.
in modern times, dreams have been seen as a connection to the unconscious mind.
they range from normal and ordinary to overly surreal and bizarre.
dreams can have varying natures, such as being frightening, exciting, magical, melancholic, adventurous, or sexual.
the events in dreams are generally outside the control of the dreamer, with the exception of lucid dreaming, where the dreamer is self-aware.
dreams can at times make a creative thought occur to the person or give a sense of inspiration.
the dreaming is a common term within the animist creation narrative of indigenous australians for a personal, or group, creation and for what may be understood as the "timeless time" of formative creation and perpetual creating.
the ancient sumerians in mesopotamia have left evidence of dream interpretation dating back to at least 3100 bc.
throughout mesopotamian history, dreams were always held to be extremely important for divination and mesopotamian kings paid close attention to them.
gudea, the king of the sumerian city-state of lagash (reigned c. 2144–2124 bc), rebuilt the temple of ningirsu as the result of a dream in which he was told to do so.
the standard akkadian epic of gilgamesh contains numerous accounts of the prophetic power of dreams.
first, gilgamesh himself has two dreams foretelling the arrival of enkidu.
later, enkidu dreams about the heroes' encounter with the giant humbaba.
dreams were also sometimes seen as a means of seeing into other worlds and it was thought that the soul, or some part of it, moved out of the body of the sleeping person and actually visited the places and persons the dreamer saw in his or her sleep.
in tablet vii of the epic, enkidu recounts to gilgamesh a dream in which he saw the gods anu, enlil, and shamash condemn him to death.
he also has a dream in which he visits the underworld.
the assyrian king ashurnasirpal ii (reigned 883–859 bc) built a temple to mamu, possibly the god of dreams, at imgur-enlil, near kalhu.
the later assyrian king ashurbanipal (reigned 668–c.
627 bc) had a dream during a desperate military situation in which his divine patron, the goddess ishtar, appeared to him and promised that she would lead him to victory.
the babylonians and assyrians divided dreams into "good," which were sent by the gods, and "bad," sent by demons.
a surviving collection of dream omens entitled iškar zaqīqu records various dream scenarios as well as prognostications of what will happen to the person who experiences each dream, apparently based on previous cases.
some list different possible outcomes, based on occasions in which people experienced similar dreams with different results.
dream scenarios mentioned include a variety of daily work events, journeys to different locations, family matters, sex acts, and encounters with human individuals, animals, and deities.
in ancient egypt, as far back as 2000 bc, the egyptians wrote down their dreams on papyrus.
people with vivid and significant dreams were thought to be blessed and were considered special.
ancient egyptians believed that dreams were like oracles, bringing messages from the gods.
they thought that the best way to receive divine revelation was through dreaming and thus they would induce (or "incubate") dreams.
egyptians would go to sanctuaries and sleep on special "dream beds" in hope of receiving advice, comfort, or healing from the gods.
in chinese history, people wrote of two vital aspects of the soul of which one is freed from the body during slumber to journey in a dream realm, while the other remained in the body, although this belief and dream interpretation had been questioned since early times, such as by the philosopher wang chong (27–97 ad).
the indian text upanishads, written between 900 and 500 bc, emphasizes two meanings of dreams.
the first says that dreams are merely expressions of inner desires.
the second is the belief of the soul leaving the body and being guided until awakened.
the greeks shared their beliefs with the egyptians on how to interpret good and bad dreams, and the idea of incubating dreams.
morpheus, the greek god of dreams, also sent warnings and prophecies to those who slept at shrines and temples.
the earliest greek beliefs about dreams were that their gods physically visited the dreamers, where they entered through a keyhole, exiting the same way after the divine message was given.
antiphon wrote the first known greek book on dreams in the 5th century bc.
in that century, other cultures influenced greeks to develop the belief that souls left the sleeping body.
hippocrates (469–399 bc) had a simple dream theory: during the day, the soul receives images; during the night, it produces images.
greek philosopher aristotle (384–322 bc) believed dreams caused physiological activity.
he thought dreams could analyze illness and predict diseases.
marcus tullius cicero, for his part, believed that all dreams are produced by thoughts and conversations a dreamer had during the preceding days.
cicero's somnium scipionis described a lengthy dream vision, which in turn was commented on by macrobius in his commentarii in somnium scipionis.
herodotus in his the histories, writes "the visions that occur to us in dreams are, more often than not, the things we have been concerned about during the day."
in welsh history, the dream of rhonabwy (welsh: breuddwyd rhonabwy) is a middle welsh prose tale.
set during the reign of madog ap maredudd, prince of powys (died 1160), it is dated to the late 12th or 13th century.
it survives in only one manuscript, the red book of hergest, and has been associated with the mabinogion since its publication by lady charlotte guest in the 19th century.
the bulk of the narrative describes a dream vision experienced by its central character, rhonabwy, a retainer of madog, in which he visits the time of king arthur.
also in welsh history, the tale 'the dream of macsen wledig' is a romanticised story about the roman emperor magnus maximus, called macsen wledig in welsh.
born in hispania, he became a legionary commander in britain, assembled a celtic army and assumed the title of emperor of the western roman empire in 383. he was defeated in battle in 385 and beheaded at the direction of the eastern roman emperor.
in judaism, dreams are considered part of the experience of the world that can be interpreted and from which lessons can be garnered.
it is discussed in the talmud, tractate berachot 55–60.
the ancient hebrews connected their dreams heavily with their religion, though the hebrews were monotheistic and believed that dreams were the voice of one god alone.
hebrews also differentiated between good dreams (from god) and bad dreams (from evil spirits).
the hebrews, like many other ancient cultures, incubated dreams in order to receive a divine revelation.
for example, the hebrew prophet samuel would "lie down and sleep in the temple at shiloh before the ark and receive the word of the lord."
most of the dreams in the bible are in the book of genesis.
christians mostly shared the beliefs of the hebrews and thought that dreams were of a supernatural character because the old testament includes frequent stories of dreams with divine inspiration.
the most famous of these dream stories was jacob's dream of a ladder that stretches from earth to heaven.
many christians preach that god can speak to people through their dreams.
the famous glossary, the somniale danielis, written in the name of daniel, attempted to teach christian populations to interpret their dreams.
iain r. edgar has researched the role of dreams in islam.
he has argued that dreams play an important role in the history of islam and the lives of muslims, since dream interpretation is the only way that muslims can receive revelations from god since the death of the last prophet, muhammad.
in the mandukya upanishad, part of the veda scriptures of indian hinduism, a dream is one of three states that the soul experiences during its lifetime, the other two states being the waking state and the sleep state.
in buddhism, ideas about dreams are similar to the classical and folk traditions in south asia.
the same dream is sometimes experienced by multiple people, as in the case of the buddha-to-be, before he is leaving his home.
it is described in the mahāvastu that several of the buddha's relatives had premonitory dreams preceding this.
some dreams are also seen to transcend time: the buddha-to-be has certain dreams that are the same as those of previous buddhas, the lalitavistara states.
in buddhist literature, dreams often function as a "signpost" motif to mark certain stages in the life of the main character.
buddhist views about dreams are expressed in the pāli commentaries and the milinda pañhā.
some philosophers have concluded that what we think of as the "real world" could be or is an illusion (an idea known as the skeptical hypothesis about ontology).
the first recorded mention of the idea was by zhuangzi, and it is also discussed in hinduism, which makes extensive use of the argument in its writings.
it was formally introduced to western philosophy by descartes in the 17th century in his meditations on first philosophy.
stimulus, usually an auditory one, becomes a part of a dream, eventually then awakening the dreamer.
some indigenous american tribes and mexican civilizations believe that dreams are a way of visiting and having contact with their ancestors.
some native american tribes used vision quests as a rite of passage, fasting and praying until an anticipated guiding dream was received, to be shared with the rest of the tribe upon their return.
the middle ages brought a harsh interpretation of dreams.
[citation needed] they were seen as evil, and the images as temptations from the devil.
many believed that during sleep, the devil could fill the human mind with corrupting and harmful thoughts.
martin luther, the protestant reformer, believed dreams were the work of the devil.
however, catholics such as st. augustine and st. jerome claimed that the direction of their lives was heavily influenced by their dreams.
[citation needed]
the depiction of dreams in renaissance and baroque art is often related to biblical narrative.
examples are joachim's dream (1304–1306) from the scrovegni chapel fresco cycle by giotto, and jacob's dream (1639) by jusepe de ribera.
dreams and dark imaginings are the theme of several notable works of the romantic era, such as goya's etching the sleep of reason produces monsters (c. 1799) and henry fuseli's painting the nightmare (1781).
salvador dalí's dream caused by the flight of a bee around a pomegranate a second before awakening (1944) also investigates this theme through absurd juxtapositions of a nude lady, tigers leaping out of a pomegranate, and a spiderlike elephant walking in the background.
henri rousseau's last painting was the dream.
le rêve ("the dream") is a 1932 painting by pablo picasso.
dream frames were frequently used in medieval allegory to justify the narrative; the book of the duchess and the vision concerning piers plowman are two such dream visions.
even before them, in antiquity, the same device had been used by cicero and lucian of samosata.
they have also featured in fantasy and speculative fiction since the 19th century.
one of the best-known dream worlds is wonderland from lewis carroll's alice's adventures in wonderland, as well as looking-glass land from its sequel, through the looking-glass.
unlike many dream worlds, carroll's logic is like that of actual dreams, with transitions and flexible causality.
other fictional dream worlds include the dreamlands of h.p.
lovecraft's dream cycle and the neverending story's world of fantasia, which includes places like the desert of lost dreams, the sea of possibilities and the swamps of sadness.
dreamworlds, shared hallucinations and other alternate realities feature in a number of works by philip k. dick, such as the three stigmata of palmer eldritch and ubik.
similar themes were explored by jorge luis borges, for instance in the circular ruins.
modern popular culture often conceives of dreams, like freud, as expressions of the dreamer's deepest fears and desires.
the film version of the wizard of oz (1939) depicts a full-color dream that causes dorothy to perceive her black-and-white reality and those with whom she shares it in a new way.
in films such as spellbound (1945), the manchurian candidate (1962), and inception (2010), the protagonists must extract vital clues from surreal dreams.
most dreams in popular culture are, however, not symbolic, but straightforward and realistic depictions of their dreamer's fears and desires.
dream scenes may be indistinguishable from those set in the dreamer's real world, a narrative device that undermines the dreamer's and the audience's sense of security and allows horror film protagonists, such as those of carrie (1976), friday the 13th (1980) or an american werewolf in london (1981) to be suddenly attacked by dark forces while resting in seemingly safe places.
in speculative fiction, the line between dreams and reality may be blurred even more in the service of the story.
dreams may be psychically invaded or manipulated (dreamscape, 1984; the nightmare on elm street films, 1984–2010; inception, 2010) or even come literally true (as in the lathe of heaven, 1971).
in ursula k. le guin's book, the lathe of heaven (1971), the protagonist finds that his "effective" dreams can retroactively change reality.
peter weir's 1977 australian film the last wave makes a simple and straightforward postulate about the premonitory nature of dreams (from one of his aboriginal characters) that "... dreams are the shadow of something real".
in kyell gold's novel green fairy from the dangerous spirits series, the protagonist, sol, experiences the memories of a dancer who died 100 years before through absinthe induced dreams and after each dream something from it materializes into his reality.
such stories play to audiences' experiences with their own dreams, which feel as real to them.
distinct types of dreams have been identified for rem and non-rem sleep stages.
the vivid bizarre dreams that are commonly remembered upon waking up are primarily associated with rem sleep.
deep (stage 3 and 4) slow-wave sleep (nrem sleep) is commonly associated with more static, thoughtful dreams.
these dreams are primarily driven by the hippocampus in the process of long-term memory consolidation and predominantly include memories of events “as they happened” without the random novel combination of objects seen in rem sleep dreams.
the rest of the article focuses on rem sleep dreaming, thereafter simply referred as dreaming.
since waking up usually happens during rapid eye movement sleep (rem), the vivid bizarre rem sleep dreams are the most common type of dreams that is remembered.
(during rem sleep an electroencephalogram (eeg) shows brain activity that, among sleep states, is most like wakefulness.)
during a typical lifespan, a person spends a total of about six years dreaming (which is about two hours each night).
most dreams only last 5 to 20 minutes.
it is unknown where in the brain dreams originate, if there is a single origin for dreams or if multiple portions of the brain are involved, or what the purpose of dreaming is for the body or mind.
during rem sleep, the release of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine, serotonin and histamine is completely suppressed.
during most dreams, the person dreaming is not aware that they are dreaming, no matter how absurd or eccentric the dream is.
the reason for this may be that the prefrontal cortex, the region of the brain responsible for logic and planning, exhibits decreased activity during dreams.
this allows the dreamer to more actively interact with the dream without thinking about what might happen, since things that would normally stand out in reality blend in with the dream scenery.
when rem sleep episodes were timed for their duration and subjects were awakened to make reports before major editing or forgetting of their dreams could take place, subjects accurately reported the length of time they had been dreaming in an rem sleep state.
some researchers have speculated that "time dilation" effects only seem to be taking place upon reflection and do not truly occur within dreams.
this close correlation of rem sleep and dream experience was the basis of the first series of reports describing the nature of dreaming: that it is a regular nightly rather than occasional phenomenon, and is correlated with high-frequency activity within each sleep period occurring at predictable intervals of approximately every 60–90 minutes in all humans throughout the lifespan.
rem sleep episodes and the dreams that accompany them lengthen progressively through the night, with the first episode being the shortest, of approximately 10–12 minutes duration, and the second and third episodes increasing to 15–20 minutes.
dreams at the end of the night may last as long as 15 minutes, although these may be experienced as several distinct episodes due to momentary arousals interrupting sleep as the night ends.
dream reports can be reported from normal subjects 50% of the time when they are awakened prior to the end of the first rem period.
this rate of retrieval is increased to about 99% when awakenings are made from the last rem period of the night.
the increase in the ability to recall dreams appears related to intensification across the night in the vividness of dream imagery, colors, and emotions.
one of the central questions of sleep research is what part of the brain is driving dreams' video-auditory experience.
during waking, most of the mind's internal imagery is controlled from the front of the brain by the lateral prefrontal cortex (lpfc).
reasoning, planning, and strategizing are the results of the constructive imagination conducted by the lpfc, which acts like a puppeteer assembling objects stored in memory into novel combinations.
during rem sleep, however the lpfc is inactive.
furthermore, in people whose lpfc is damaged, dreams do not change at all, confirming that lpfc does not control dreaming.
during deep slow-wave sleep, imagery is primarily driven by the hippocampus in the process of long-term memory consolidation and predominantly includes memories of events “as they happened” without the random novel combination of objects seen in rem sleep dreams.
during rem sleep, however, the communication between the neocortex and the hippocampus is disrupted by a high ach level.
without being driven by the lpfc (as in waking) and hippocampus (as in slow-wave sleep), it is unclear how exactly images appear in one's perception during rem sleep.
a common explanation is that neuronal ensembles in the posterior cortical hot zone, primed by previous activity or current sensory or subcortical stimulation, activate spontaneously, triggered by the ponto-geniculo-occipital (pgo) waves that characterize rem sleep.
in the words of hobson & mccarley, the neocortex is making “the best of a bad job in producing even partially coherent dream imagery from the relatively noisy signals sent up from the brain stem.”
it is also commonly accepted that the intensity of dreams during rem sleep can be dialed up or down by the dopaminergic cells of the ventral tegmental area.
for example, drugs that block dopaminergic activity (e.g., haloperidol) inhibit unusually frequent and vivid dreaming, while the increase of dopamine (e.g., through l-dopa) stimulates excessive vivid dreaming and nightmares.
rem sleep and the ability to dream seem to be embedded in the biology of many animals in addition to humans.
scientific research suggests that all mammals experience rem.
the range of rem can be seen across species: dolphins experience minimal rem, while humans are in the middle of the scale and the armadillo and the opossum (a marsupial) are among the most prolific dreamers, judging from their rem patterns.
studies have observed signs of dreaming in all mammals studied, including monkeys, dogs, cats, rats, elephants, and shrews.
there have also been signs of dreaming in birds and reptiles.
sleeping and dreaming are intertwined.
scientific research results regarding the function of dreaming in animals remain disputable; however, the function of sleeping in living organisms is increasingly clear.
for example, sleep deprivation experiments conducted on rats and other animals have resulted in the deterioration of physiological functioning and actual tissue damage.
some scientists argue that humans dream for the same reason other amniotes do.
from a darwinian perspective dreams would have to fulfill some kind of biological requirement, provide some benefit for natural selection to take place, or at least have no negative impact on fitness.
in 2000 antti revonsuo, a professor at the university of turku in finland, claimed that centuries ago dreams would prepare humans for recognizing and avoiding danger by presenting a simulation of threatening events.
the theory has therefore been called the threat-simulation theory.
according to tsoukalas (2012) dreaming is related to the reactive patterns elicited by encounters with predators, a fact that is still evident in the control mechanisms of rem sleep (see below).
many hypotheses have been proposed as to what function dreams perform, some of which have been contradicted by later empirical studies.
it has also been proposed that dreams serve no particular purpose, and that they are simply a byproduct of biochemical processes that only occur in the brain during sleep.
in the late 19th century, psychotherapist sigmund freud developed a theory (since discredited) that the content of dreams is driven by unconscious wish fulfillment.
freud called dreams the "royal road to the unconscious."
he theorized that the content of dreams reflects the dreamer's unconscious mind and specifically that dream content is shaped by unconscious wish fulfillment.
he argued that important unconscious desires often relate to early childhood memories and experiences.
freud's theory describes dreams as having both manifest and latent content.
latent content relates to deep unconscious wishes or fantasies while manifest content is superficial and meaningless.
manifest content often masks or obscures latent content.
in his early work, freud argued that the vast majority of latent dream content is sexual in nature, but he later moved away from this categorical position.
in beyond the pleasure principle he considered how trauma or aggression could influence dream content.
he also discussed supernatural origins in dreams and occultism, a lecture published in new introductory lectures on psychoanalysis.
late in life freud acknowledged that "it is impossible to classify as wish fulfillments" the repetitive nightmares associated with posttraumatic stress disorder.
modern experimental studies weigh against many of freud's theories regarding dreams.
freud's "dream-work" interpretation strategies have not been found to have empirical validity.
his theory that dreams were the "guardians" of sleep, repressing and disguising bodily urges to ensure sleep continues, seems unlikely given studies of individuals who can sleep without dreaming.
his assertions that repressed memory in infants re-surface decades later in adult dreams conflicts with modern research on memory.
freud's theory has difficulty explaining why young children have static and bland dreams, or why the emotions in most dreams are negative.
on the plus side, modern researchers agree with freud that dreams do have coherence, and that dream content connects to other psychological variables and often connect to recent waking thoughts (though not as often as freud supposed).
despite the lack of scientific evidence, dream interpretation services based on freudian or other systems remain popular.
carl jung rejected many of freud's theories.
jung expanded on freud's idea that dream content relates to the dreamer's unconscious desires.
he described dreams as messages to the dreamer and argued that dreamers should pay attention for their own good.
he came to believe that dreams present the dreamer with revelations that can uncover and help to resolve emotional or religious problems and fears.
jung wrote that recurring dreams show up repeatedly to demand attention, suggesting that the dreamer is neglecting an issue related to the dream.
he called this "compensation."
the dream balances the conscious belief and attitudes with an alternative.
jung did not believe that the conscious attitude was wrong and that the dream provided the true belief.
he argued that good work with dreams takes both into account and comes up with a balanced viewpoint.
he believed that many of the symbols or images from these dreams return with each dream.
jung believed that memories formed throughout the day also play a role in dreaming.
these memories leave impressions for the unconscious to deal with when the ego is at rest.
the unconscious mind re-enacts these glimpses of the past in the form of a dream.
jung called this a day residue.
jung also argued that dreaming is not a purely individual concern, that all dreams are part of "one great web of psychological factors."
fritz perls presented his theory of dreams as part of the holistic nature of gestalt therapy.
dreams are seen as projections of parts of the self that have been ignored, rejected, or suppressed.
jung argued that one could consider every person in the dream to represent an aspect of the dreamer, which he called the subjective approach to dreams.
perls expanded this point of view to say that even inanimate objects in the dream may represent aspects of the dreamer.
the dreamer may, therefore, be asked to imagine being an object in the dream and to describe it, in order to bring into awareness the characteristics of the object that correspond with the dreamer's personality.
in 1976 j. allan hobson and robert mccarley proposed a new theory that changed dream research, challenging the previously held freudian view of dreams as unconscious wishes to be interpreted.
they assume that the same structures that induce rem sleep also generate sensory information.
hobson's 1976 research suggested that the signals interpreted as dreams originate in the brainstem during rem sleep.
according to hobson and other researchers, circuits in the brainstem are activated during rem sleep.
once these circuits are activated, areas of the limbic system involved in emotions, sensations, and memories, including the amygdala and hippocampus, become active.
the brain synthesizes and interprets these activities; for example, changes in the physical environment such as temperature and humidity, or physical stimuli such as ejaculation, and attempts to create meaning from these signals, result in dreaming.
however, research by mark solms suggests that dreams are generated in the forebrain, and that rem sleep and dreaming are not directly related.
while working in the neurosurgery department at hospitals in johannesburg and london, solms had access to patients with various brain injuries.
he began to question patients about their dreams and confirmed that patients with damage to the parietal lobe stopped dreaming; this finding was in line with hobson's 1977 theory.
however, solms did not encounter cases of loss of dreaming with patients having brainstem damage.
this observation forced him to question hobson's prevailing theory, which marked the brainstem as the source of the signals interpreted as dreams.
combining hobson's activation synthesis hypothesis with solms' findings, the continual-activation theory of dreaming presented by jie zhang proposes that dreaming is a result of brain activation and synthesis; at the same time, dreaming and rem sleep are controlled by different brain mechanisms.
zhang hypothesizes that the function of sleep is to process, encode, and transfer the data from the temporary memory store to the long-term memory store.
during nrem sleep the conscious-related memory (declarative memory) is processed, and during rem sleep the unconscious-related memory (procedural memory) is processed.
zhang assumes that during rem sleep the unconscious part of a brain is busy processing the procedural memory; meanwhile, the level of activation in the conscious part of the brain descends to a very low level as the inputs from the sensory systems are basically disconnected.
this triggers the "continual-activation" mechanism to generate a data stream from the memory stores to flow through the conscious part of the brain.
zhang suggests that this pulsatile brain activation is the inducer of each dream.
he proposes that, with the involvement of the brain associative thinking system, dreaming is, thereafter, self-maintained with the dreamer's own thinking until the next pulse of memory insertion.
this explains why dreams have both characteristics of continuity (within a dream) and sudden changes (between two dreams).
a detailed explanation of how a dream is synthesized is given in a later paper.
according to tsoukalas (2012) rem sleep is an evolutionary transformation of a well-known defensive mechanism, the tonic immobility reflex.
this reflex, also known as animal hypnosis or death feigning, functions as the last line of defense against an attacking predator and consists of the total immobilization of the animal: the animal appears dead (cf.
"playing possum").
tsoukalas claims that the neurophysiology and phenomenology of this reaction shows striking similarities to rem sleep, a fact that suggests a deep evolutionary kinship.
for example, both reactions exhibit brainstem control, paralysis, hippocampal theta and thermoregulatory changes.
tsoukalas claims that this theory integrates many earlier findings into a unified framework.
eugen tarnow suggests that dreams are ever-present excitations of long-term memory, even during waking life.
the strangeness of dreams is due to the format of long-term memory, reminiscent of penfield & rasmussen's findings that electrical excitations of the cortex give rise to experiences similar to dreams.
during waking life an executive function interprets long-term memory consistent with reality checking.
tarnow's theory is a reworking of freud's theory of dreams in which freud's unconscious is replaced with the long-term memory system and freud's "dream work" describes the structure of long-term memory.
a 2001 study showed evidence that illogical locations, characters, and dream flow may help the brain strengthen the linking and consolidation of semantic memories.
these conditions may occur because, during rem sleep, the flow of information between the hippocampus and neocortex is reduced.
increasing levels of the stress hormone cortisol late in sleep (often during rem sleep) causes this decreased communication.
one stage of memory consolidation is the linking of distant but related memories.
payne and nadal hypothesize these memories are then consolidated into a smooth narrative, similar to a process that happens when memories are created under stress.robert (1886), a physician from hamburg, was the first who suggested that dreams are a need and that they have the function to erase (a) sensory impressions that were not fully worked up, and (b) ideas that were not fully developed during the day.
by the dream work, incomplete material is either removed (suppressed) or deepened and included into memory.
robert's ideas were cited repeatedly by freud in his die traumdeutung.
hughlings jackson (1911) viewed that sleep serves to sweep away unnecessary memories and connections from the day.
this was revised in 1983 by crick and mitchison's "reverse learning" theory, which states that dreams are like the cleaning-up operations of computers when they are offline, removing (suppressing) parasitic nodes and other "junk" from the mind during sleep.
however, the opposite view that dreaming has an information handling, memory-consolidating function (hennevin and leconte, 1971) is also common.
coutts describes[qualify evidence] dreams as playing a central role in a two-phase sleep process that improves the mind's ability to meet human needs during wakefulness.
during the accommodation phase, mental schemas self-modify by incorporating dream themes.
during the emotional selection phase, dreams test prior schema accommodations.
those that appear adaptive are retained, while those that appear maladaptive are culled.
the cycle maps to the sleep cycle, repeating several times during a typical night's sleep.
alfred adler suggested that dreams are often emotional preparations for solving problems, intoxicating an individual away from common sense toward private logic.
the residual dream feelings may either reinforce or inhibit contemplated action.
numerous theories state that dreaming is a random by-product of rem sleep physiology and that it does not serve any natural purpose.
flanagan claims that "dreams are evolutionary epiphenomena" and they have no adaptive function.
"dreaming came along as a free ride on a system designed to think and to sleep."
j.a.
hobson, for different reasons, also considers dreams epiphenomena.
he believes that the substance of dreams have no significant influence on waking actions, and most people go about their daily lives perfectly well without remembering their dreams.
hobson proposed the activation-synthesis theory, which states that "there is a randomness of dream imagery and the randomness synthesizes dream-generated images to fit the patterns of internally generated stimulations".
this theory is based on the physiology of rem sleep, and hobson believes dreams are the outcome of the forebrain reacting to random activity beginning at the brainstem.
the activation-synthesis theory hypothesizes that the peculiar nature of dreams is attributed to certain parts of the brain trying to piece together a story out of what is essentially bizarre information.
in 2005, hobson published a book, thirteen dreams that freud never had, in which he analyzed his own dreams after having a stroke in 2001.
some evolutionary psychologists believe dreams serve some adaptive function for survival.
deirdre barrett describes dreaming as simply "thinking in different biochemical state" and believes people continue to work on all the same problems—personal and objective—in that state.
her research finds that anything—math, musical composition, business dilemmas—may get solved during dreaming.
finnish psychologist antti revonsuo posits that dreams have evolved for "threat simulation" exclusively.
according to the threat simulation theory he proposes, during much of human evolution physical and interpersonal threats were serious, giving reproductive advantage to those who survived them.
therefore, dreaming evolved to replicate these threats and continually practice dealing with them.
in support of this theory, revonsuo shows that contemporary dreams comprise much more threatening events than people meet in daily non-dream life, and the dreamer usually engages appropriately with them.
it is suggested by this theory that dreams serve the purpose of allowing for the rehearsal of threatening scenarios in order to better prepare an individual for real-life threats.
according to tsoukalas (2012) the biology of dreaming is related to the reactive patterns elicited by predatorial encounters (especially the tonic immobility reflex), a fact that lends support to evolutionary theories claiming that dreams specialize in threat avoidance or emotional processing.
there are many other hypotheses about the function of dreams, including:
from the 1940s to 1985, calvin s. hall collected more than 50,000 dream reports at western reserve university.
in 1966 hall and van de castle published the content analysis of dreams, in which they outlined a coding system to study 1,000 dream reports from college students.
results indicated that participants from varying parts of the world demonstrated similarity in their dream content.
hall's complete dream reports were made publicly available in the mid-1990s by hall's protégé william domhoff.
the visual nature of dreams is generally highly phantasmagoric; that is, different locations and objects continuously blend into each other.
the visuals (including locations, characters/people, objects/artifacts) are generally reflective of a person's memories and experiences, but conversation can take on highly exaggerated and bizarre forms.
some dreams may even tell elaborate stories wherein the dreamer enters entirely new, complex worlds and awakes with ideas, thoughts and feelings never experienced prior to the dream.
people who are blind from birth do not have visual dreams.
their dream contents are related to other senses like hearing, touch, smell and taste, whichever are present since birth.
in the hall study, the most common emotion experienced in dreams was anxiety.
other emotions included abandonment, anger, fear, joy, and happiness.
negative emotions were much more common than positive ones.
the hall data analysis shows that sexual dreams occur no more than 10% of the time and are more prevalent in young to mid-teens.
another study showed that 8% of both men and women's dreams have sexual content.
in some cases, sexual dreams may result in orgasms or nocturnal emissions.
these are colloquially known as wet dreams.
a small minority of people say that they dream only in black and white.
[failed verification] a 2008 study by a researcher at the university of dundee found that people who were only exposed to black-and-white television and film in childhood reported dreaming in black and white about 25% of the time.
there is evidence that certain medical conditions (normally only neurological conditions) can impact dreams.
for instance, some people with synesthesia have never reported entirely black-and-white dreaming, and often have a difficult time imagining the idea of dreaming in only black and white.
dream interpretation can be a result of subjective ideas and experiences.
one study found that most people believe that "their dreams reveal meaningful hidden truths".
in one study conducted in the united states, south korea and india, they found that 74% of indians, 65% of south koreans and 56% of americans believed their dream content provided them with meaningful insight into their unconscious beliefs and desires.
this freudian view of dreaming was believed by the largely non-scientific public significantly more than theories of dreaming that attribute dream content to memory consolidation, problem-solving, or random brain activity.
in the paper, morewedge and norton (2009) also found that people attribute more importance to dream content than to similar thought content that occurs while they are awake.
in one study, americans were more likely to report that they would miss their flight if they dreamt of their plane crashing than if they thought of their plane crashing the night before flying (while awake), and that they would be as likely to miss their flight if they dreamt of their plane crashing the night before their flight as if there was an actual plane crash on the route they intended to take.
not all dream content was considered equally important.
participants in their studies were more likely to perceive dreams to be meaningful when the content of dreams was in accordance with their beliefs and desires while awake.
people were more likely to view a positive dream about a friend to be meaningful than a positive dream about someone they disliked, for example, and were more likely to view a negative dream about a person they disliked as meaningful than a negative dream about a person they liked.
therapy for recurring nightmares (often associated with posttraumatic stress disorder) can include imagining alternative scenarios that could begin at each step of the dream.
during the night, many external stimuli may bombard the senses, but the brain often interprets the stimulus and makes it a part of a dream to ensure continued sleep.
dream incorporation is a phenomenon whereby an actual sensation, such as environmental sounds, is incorporated into dreams, such as hearing a phone ringing in a dream while it is ringing in reality or dreaming of urination while wetting the bed.
the mind can, however, awaken an individual if they are in danger or if trained to respond to certain sounds, such as a baby crying.
the term "dream incorporation" is also used in research examining the degree to which preceding daytime events become elements of dreams.
recent studies suggest that events in the day immediately preceding, and those about a week before, have the most influence.
gary alan fine and laura fischer leighton argue that “dreams are external to the individual mind” because “1) dreams are not willed by the individual self; 2) dreams reflect social reality; 3) dreams are public rhetoric; and 4) dreams are collectively interpretable.”
according to surveys, it is common for people to feel their dreams are predicting subsequent life events.
psychologists have explained these experiences in terms of memory biases, namely a selective memory for accurate predictions and distorted memory so that dreams are retrospectively fitted onto life experiences.
the multi-faceted nature of dreams makes it easy to find connections between dream content and real events.
the term "veridical dream" has been used to indicate dreams that reveal or contain truths not yet known to the dreamer, whether future events or secrets.
in one experiment, subjects were asked to write down their dreams in a diary.
this prevented the selective memory effect, and the dreams no longer seemed accurate about the future.
another experiment gave subjects a fake diary of a student with apparently precognitive dreams.
this diary described events from the person's life, as well as some predictive dreams and some non-predictive dreams.
when subjects were asked to recall the dreams they had read, they remembered more of the successful predictions than unsuccessful ones.
lucid dreaming is the conscious perception of one's state while dreaming.
in this state the dreamer may often have some degree of control over their own actions within the dream or even the characters and the environment of the dream.
dream control has been reported to improve with practiced deliberate lucid dreaming, but the ability to control aspects of the dream is not necessary for a dream to qualify as "lucid" — a lucid dream is any dream during which the dreamer knows they are dreaming.
the occurrence of lucid dreaming has been scientifically verified.
oneironaut is a term sometimes used for those who lucidly dream.
in 1975, psychologist keith hearne successfully recorded a communication from a dreamer experiencing a lucid dream.
on april 12, 1975, after agreeing to move his eyes left and right upon becoming lucid, the subject and hearne's co-author on the resulting article, alan worsley, successfully carried out this task.
years later, psychophysiologist stephen laberge conducted similar work including:
communication between two dreamers has also been documented.
the processes involved included eeg monitoring, ocular signaling, incorporation of reality in the form of red light stimuli and a coordinating website.
the website tracked when both dreamers were dreaming and sent the stimulus to one of the dreamers where it was incorporated into the dream.
this dreamer, upon becoming lucid, signaled with eye movements; this was detected by the website whereupon the stimulus was sent to the second dreamer, invoking incorporation into this dream.
dreams of absent-minded transgression (damt) are dreams wherein the dreamer absentmindedly performs an action that he or she has been trying to stop (one classic example is of a quitting smoker having dreams of lighting a cigarette).
subjects who have had damt have reported waking with intense feelings of guilt.
one study found a positive association between having these dreams and successfully stopping the behavior.
the recollection of dreams is extremely unreliable, though it is a skill that can be trained.
dreams can usually be recalled if a person is awakened while dreaming.
women tend to have more frequent dream recall than men.
dreams that are difficult to recall may be characterized by relatively little affect, and factors such as salience, arousal, and interference play a role in dream recall.
often, a dream may be recalled upon viewing or hearing a random trigger or stimulus.
the salience hypothesis proposes that dream content that is salient, that is, novel, intense, or unusual, is more easily remembered.
there is considerable evidence that vivid, intense, or unusual dream content is more frequently recalled.
a dream journal can be used to assist dream recall, for personal interest or psychotherapy purposes.
for some people, sensations from the previous night's dreams are sometimes spontaneously experienced in falling asleep.
however they are usually too slight and fleeting to allow dream recall.
at least 95% of all dreams are not remembered.
certain brain chemicals necessary for converting short-term memories into long-term ones are suppressed during rem sleep.
unless a dream is particularly vivid and if one wakes during or immediately after it, the content of the dream is not remembered.
recording or reconstructing dreams may one day assist with dream recall.
using technologies such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) and electromyography (emg), researchers have been able to record basic dream imagery, dream speech activity and dream motor behavior (such as walking and hand movements).
in line with the salience hypothesis, there is considerable evidence that people who have more vivid, intense or unusual dreams show better recall.
there is evidence that continuity of consciousness is related to recall.
specifically, people who have vivid and unusual experiences during the day tend to have more memorable dream content and hence better dream recall.
people who score high on measures of personality traits associated with creativity, imagination, and fantasy, such as openness to experience, daydreaming, fantasy proneness, absorption, and hypnotic susceptibility, tend to show more frequent dream recall.
there is also evidence for continuity between the bizarre aspects of dreaming and waking experience.
that is, people who report more bizarre experiences during the day, such as people high in schizotypy (psychosis proneness) have more frequent dream recall and also report more frequent nightmares.
one theory of déjà vu attributes the feeling of having previously seen or experienced something to having dreamed about a similar situation or place, and forgetting about it until one seems to be mysteriously reminded of the situation or the place while awake.
a daydream is a visionary fantasy, especially one of happy, pleasant thoughts, hopes or ambitions, imagined as coming to pass, and experienced while awake.
there are many different types of daydreams, and there is no consistent definition amongst psychologists.
the general public also uses the term for a broad variety of experiences.
research by harvard psychologist deirdre barrett has found that people who experience vivid dreamlike mental images reserve the word for these, whereas many other people refer to milder imagery, realistic future planning, review of past memories or just "spacing out"—i.e.
one's mind going relatively blank—when they talk about "daydreaming."'
while daydreaming has long been derided as a lazy, non-productive pastime, it is now commonly acknowledged that daydreaming can be constructive in some contexts.
there are numerous examples of people in creative or artistic careers, such as composers, novelists and filmmakers, developing new ideas through daydreaming.
similarly, research scientists, mathematicians and physicists have developed new ideas by daydreaming about their subject areas.
a hallucination, in the broadest sense of the word, is a perception in the absence of a stimulus.
in a stricter sense, hallucinations are perceptions in a conscious and awake state, in the absence of external stimuli, and have qualities of real perception, in that they are vivid, substantial, and located in external objective space.
the latter definition distinguishes hallucinations from the related phenomena of dreaming, which does not involve wakefulness.
a nightmare is an unpleasant dream that can cause a strong negative emotional response from the mind, typically fear or horror, but also despair, anxiety and great sadness.
the dream may contain situations of danger, discomfort, psychological or physical terror.
sufferers usually awaken in a state of distress and may be unable to return to sleep for a prolonged period of time.
a night terror, also known as a sleep terror or pavor nocturnus, is a parasomnia disorder that predominantly affects children, causing feelings of terror or dread.
night terrors should not be confused with nightmares, which are bad dreams that cause the feeling of horror or fear.
the bruce lee statue in los angeles is a statue built as a tribute to deceased martial artist, bruce lee, who died at age 32 in 1973.
the 7-foot bronze sculpture was originally created by an artist in guangzhou, china.
it was transported to los angeles, california after a five-year effort by lee's daughter shannon, and is the only statue of her late father in the united states.
its unveiling occurred on june 15, 2013 to a crowd of hundreds, including ground-breaking asian american actor james hong; its permanent installation will not occur until the erection of spectator seating and a concrete plinth.
although born in san francisco’s chinatown, lee opened a martial arts school in los angeles' chinatown and was a fixture there during the filming of the 1960s television series the green hornet.
the statue is located near the pedestrian intersection of sun mun way and jung jing road in chinatown's central plaza.
weighing in at about 1,595 pounds(723.47 kg), the statue, with its rippling muscles poised to strike with a nunchaku, has become a cultural mecca for lee's fans, who are regularly seen taking selfies while poised in combat stances.
the national heritage monument is a group of copper statues representing anti-apartheid activists, zulu chiefs and missionaries.
the monument is meant to reflect the struggle for liberation going back into the 1600s.
it is located in groenkloof nature reserve.
the project was started in 2010, but as of 2015, only has 55 statues.
a total of 400 to 500 statues are planned.
when complete, the monument will be called "the long walk to freedom."
the idea for the project came from dali tambo in 2010, who is also the ceo of the national heritage project company.
the first of the statues were unveiled in september of 2015 by nathi mthethwa, the south african minister of arts and culture.
izena tamaudun (伊是名玉陵) is one of the three royal mausoleums of the ryukyu kingdom, along with tamaudun at shuri castle and urasoe yōdore at urasoe castle.
it is located near izena castle in izena, okinawa.
it was built in 1501 by king shō shin.
the campeonato de españa–copa de su majestad el rey,[a] commonly known as copa del rey[b] or simply la copa,[c] is an annual knockout football competition in spanish football, organized by the royal spanish football federation.
the competition was founded in 1903, thus making it the oldest spanish football competition.
it is considered one of the most prestigious national cup trophies in the world.
copa del rey winners qualify for the following season's uefa europa league.
if they have already qualified for europe through their league position, then the europa league spot is given to the highest-place team in the league who has not yet qualified (until 2014 this place was awarded to the copa runners-up, unless they too had already qualified via the league).
barcelona is the most successful club in the competition, winning their fourth consecutive and 30th overall title against sevilla in the 2018 final held at the metropolitano stadium.
athletic bilbao have the second-most titles.
the current title holders are valencia.
they defeated barcelona in the 2019 final held at the estadio benito villamarín in seville.
in 1902, a competition under the name copa de la coronación was played after carlos padrós, later president of real madrid, suggested a  football tournament to celebrate the coronation of spanish king alfonso xiii.
four other teams joined madrid fc for the competition: fc barcelona, club español de foot-ball, new foot-ball de madrid and club bizcaya (a team made up of players from athletic club and bilbao fc) which eventually defeated barcelona in the final.
that cup is on display in the athletic bilbao museum and the club includes the victory in its honours list.
nevertheless, it is considered only the forerunner of the copa del rey.
the royal spanish football federation officially does not recognize it.
the copa del rey was spain's football national championship from 1903 until the foundation of the campeonato de liga — league championship — in 1928. it was initially known as the copa del ayuntamiento de madrid (madrid city council's cup).
between 1905 and 1932, it was known as the copa de su majestad el rey alfonso xiii (his majesty king alfonso xiii's cup).
during the second spanish republic, it was known as the copa del presidente de la república (president of the republic cup) or copa de españa (spanish cup) and during the years of francisco franco's spanish state, it was known as the copa de su excelencia el generalísimo or copa del generalísimo (his excellency, the supreme general's cup).
athletic bilbao were declared winners in 1904 after their opponents español de madrid failed to show up.
in both 1910 and 1913, there was a split among the clubs and two rival associations, the unión española de clubs de fútbol and the federación española de fútbol, organised rival competitions, the copa uecf and the copa fef.
in 1937, during the spanish civil war, clubs in the republican area of spain entered the copa de la españa libre, with levante beating their city rivals valencia 1–0 in the final.
although in 2007 the congress of deputies urged the royal spanish football federation to recognise it as a copa del rey win for levante, the governing body of spanish football has not made a decision yet (as of 2008).
because of the dispute regarding the 1902 competition, the statistics regarding the leading winners are also disputed.
barcelona have won the copa 30 times; athletic bilbao are in second place, with either 23 or 24 titles, depending on the source.
before the formation of la liga in 1929, the competition was effectively a national championship.
teams qualified to enter via their regional leagues.
over the years, various formats, including group stages have been used.
reserve teams of the professional clubs, who compete in lower divisions of the league pyramid, were permitted to take part until 1990. for a number of years, only teams from the primera división, segunda a, about 23 teams from the segunda b and the 17 tercera división champions (or runners-up if the champion was a reserve team) were invited to enter, giving a total of 83. amended rules for the 2019–20 edition led to the number of entrants increasing to 125, including winners of the regional divisions at the fifth level.
all rounds are single-leg ties with lower division teams hosting the match and the majority of the top-level clubs entering at the first round (four teams taking part in the supercopa de españa entering in the third round - last 32), other than the semi-final stage which is played over two legs.
this is another change in the 2019–20 edition, with prior editions involving two legs from the point at which the top tier clubs entered in the fourth round (last 32).
the final is a one-off game played at a neutral venue.
the winners qualify for both the supercopa de españa and the uefa europa league the following season; in the past, the runners-up often played in the supercopa if the winners had also finished as league champions (although on some occasions in these circumstances, it was not played and the double winners were awarded the victory), and from the 2019–20 supercopa de españa edition onwards, the previous copa del rey runners-up automatically qualify in addition to the winners with four teams taking part in the event.
throughout the history of the competition, there have been 12 actual trophies, which were  permanently awarded to clubs for winning the competition either three times in a row or on five separate occasions, and for other special reasons.
thus, five trophies have been permanently awarded to barcelona, three to athletic bilbao and one to real madrid (the last copa de la república in 1936).
athletic kept the first trophy as inaugural winners, sevilla fc were awarded the trofeo del generalísimo after its first edition in 1939 and atlético madrid, winners the previous year, were awarded the 11th trophy following the death of francisco franco in 1976.
on 22 december 2010, at an extraordinary general meeting of the royal spanish football federation, sevilla requested permission from the federation to keep the trophy they had won in the 2010 final to commemorate the victory of the spanish national team at the 2010 fifa world cup in south africa.
a new trophy was made by madrid jeweller federico alegre.
the trophy, made of silver, weighs 15 kg (33 lb) and is 75 cm (30 in) tall.
on 21 april 2011, real madrid became the first recipients of the trophy.
during the post-game celebrations, the trophy was accidentally dropped by real madrid player sergio ramos from the top of a double-decker bus, which then ran over it.
ten pieces were found by civil servicemen when they recovered it from the ground at plaza de cibeles.
the club received a copy which is displayed at santiago bernabéu.

the 1902 version was won by bizcaya, a team made up of players from athletic club and bilbao fc.
in 1903 these two clubs merged as the current athletic club.
the 1902 cup is on display in the athletic museum and the club includes it in its own honors list.

national memorial shrine of quezon) is a monument and national shrine dedicated to former philippine president manuel quezon located within the grounds of quezon memorial circle.
it also houses a museum at its base.

79 signed by then president sergio osmeña on december 17, 1945. then president elpidio quirino proposed the relocation of the monument away from its original planned site but such plans were not pushed through.
the bureau of public works commenced the construction of the monument in 1952.
the monument was placed under the jurisdiction of the national historical institute through presidential decree no.1 issued by then president ferdinand marcos on september 24, 1972.
on january 14, 1974, the monument was formally designated as a national shrine and was inaugurated in august 19, 1978. the remains of former president manuel quezon was transferred to the quezon memorial shrine from the manila north cemetery on august 1, 1979. the remains of his wife aurora aragon quezon, was likewise transferred to the shrine on april 28, 2005.

each of the angels were given a traditional clothing representing one of the three island group.
the angel figures were made by italian sculptor francesco riccardo monti.
under the watch of former quezon city mayor tomas morato, the monument was beautified by amberti, an italian architect hired by morato with carrara marble.
morato's successors replaced the italian marbles with locally sourced marble.

the andrés bonifacio monument, commonly known simply as bonifacio monument or monumento, is a memorial monument in caloocan, philippines which was designed by the national artist guillermo tolentino to commemorate philippine revolutionary andrés bonifacio, the founder and supremo of the katipunan.
andrés bonifacio fought for independence from the politically and socially ruthless colonial rule by spain.
the monument 45 feet (14 m) in height with symbolic images and other features known as the "cry of balintawak" is acclaimed as one of the best monuments in the world.
the monument is located in south caloocan at a roundabout crossing of four roads, namely epifanio de los santos avenue (edsa), macarthur highway, samson road and avenida rizal, the old road leading to manila.
the bonifacio monument recalls the philippine revolution which was spearheaded  by andrés bonifacio who had urged his men to raise against the colonial rule of spain.
his call to take arms against the spanish rule was given on 23 august 1896, which is widely known as "cry of pugad lawin."
the cornerstone was formally laid by aurora quezon, the wife of filipino senate president and later president manuel l. quezon.
the monument, which was created under the orders of american governor-general frank murphy, was inaugurated on 23 october 1933. it was inaugurated by the speaker of the house, with much fanfare in a colourful function led by three women from luzon (of the women’s college), visayas (of the institute of women), and mindanao (of the centro escolar de señoritas/center for women) with other women representing the eight provinces of manila, cavite, batangas, bulacan, pampanga, tarlac, nueva ecija, and laguna which had participated in the revolution of 1896.
it is considered the most symbolic of all the monuments in the country, even grander than motto stella.
on 30 november 2013, the sesquicentennial of bonifacio’s birth and the 80th anniversary of the monument’s unveiling was celebrated.
the bonifacio monument, which was sculpted by guillermo tolentino in 1933, an obelisk, rises to a height of 45 feet (14 m); the obelisk is made up of five parts representing five aspects of the society, "kataastaasan, kagalanggalang na katipunan ng mga anak ng bayan (highest and most venerable association of the sons of the nation)".
it is crowned by a figure with wings representing triumph.
below the vertical pylon 20 figures cast in bronze have been molded over an octagonal shaped plinth, plus one angel of peace at the top.
the octagon represents the eight provinces who fought against spain and also represents eight rays of the katipunan flag.
the plinth is raised in three steps, each step representing the three centuries of spanish rule.
these figures are a representation of the people of philippines, who faced inequality, agony and suppression under the colonial rule which eventually ended in an armed revolution in 1896. the main central image of the monument holds a bolo, a machete, in the right hand and a gun in the other hand.
at the back of the central figure a flag of katipunan in an unfurled state is depicted.
a remarkable feature of the molded images of the human figures is the classic style with detailing marked by realistic expressions reflecting the revolutionary spirit with an "upright head and body" and with arms spread on the sides.
the central obelisk is surrounded by pools of water.
the temple expiatori del sagrat cor (catalan pronunciation: [səˈɣɾat ˈkɔɾ]; english: expiatory church of the sacred heart of jesus, spanish: templo expiatorio del sagrado corazón de jesús) is a roman catholic church and minor basilica located on the summit of mount tibidabo in barcelona, catalonia, spain.
the building is the work of the spanish architect enric sagnier and was completed by his son josep maria sagnier i vidal.
the construction of the church, dedicated to the sacred heart of jesus, lasted from 1902 to 1961.
the idea of building a catholic church on the summit of the mount tibidabo emerged in the late 19th century amidst rumors about the construction of a protestant church and a hotel-casino at that location.
this motivated a "board of catholic knights" to acquire the ownership of the field and give it to saint john bosco in 1886, when he was visiting barcelona at the invitation of dorotea de chopitea, a great patron and promoter of the project.
from this arose the idea of a building dedicated to the sacred heart of jesus, a dedication very popular at that time thanks to the impetus given by pope leo xiii, and following in line with the church built in rome by bosco himself (sacro cuore di gesù a castro pretorio) and the famous sacré-cœur in paris.
in 1886 a neo-gothic hermitage was built, and two years later, for the universal exposition, the vallvidrera road was urbanized and a pavilion of mudejar inspiration was built beside the hermitage to serve as a viewing point (for the city below).
however, the project to build the church suffered a significant delay mainly because of the development of a new project to build an astronomical observatory on the summit of tibidabo, which was eventually constructed on a nearby hill (fabra observatory).
finally, on 28 december 1902, the first stone was placed in a ceremony presided by the bishop of barcelona, salvador casañas i pagès.
the crypt was built between 1903 and 1911, and the main church was built between 1915 and 1951. the church was consecrated by bishop gregorio modrego casaus during the 35th eucharistic congress held in barcelona in 1952. the towers were completed afterward, with work officially ending in 1961. on 29 october 1961 the church received the title of minor basilica from pope john xxiii.
the external appearance of the church is of a romanesque fortress of stone from montjuïc (the crypt), topped by a monumental neo-gothic church accessed by two grand outdoor stairways.
the upper church has a central floor with an octagonal dome on eight columns.
the dome is crowned with an image of the sacred heart; the original work was by frederic marès (destroyed in 1936) and replaced in 1950 with another by josep miret.
the upper church is square with three apses, a large central tower, and four lower towers marking the four corners of the square, and  statues of the twelve apostles sculpted by josep miret.
the main facade has three sections, the central wider, chaired by the figure of the archangel michael in the arch of the main entrance, and john bosco in the pediment above.
over the left door is the statue of teresa of ávila and over the right, marguerite marie alacoque.
above the door is an open gallery of arches with tracery.
the façade of the crypt has a richly decorated tympanum with sculptures by alfons juyol i bach following the design of eusebi arnau.
the sculptures represent the virgin of mercy, saint george, and saint james, the patron saints of barcelona, catalonia, and spain, respectively.
the crypt facade consists of three semicircular arches on columns, inserted under a larger semicircular arch, originally decorated with a mosaic of the holy trinity by daniel zuloaga (destroyed in 1936).
in 1955 it was redecorated by the bru workshop of barcelona; the work depicts an allegory of the devotion of spain, represented by its patron saints.
the interior is divided into a nave and two aisles with semicircular apses, with stained glasses and four rose windows on the facades.
in the main altar stands the great crucifix, a work by joan puigdollers.
the windows of the presbytery are dedicated to pius x, john the evangelist, marguerite marie alacoque, paul the apostle and john bosco.
the left altar has five stained glasses dedicated to various marian devotions: the virgin of antipolo (philippines), our lady of luján (argentina), the assumption of mary, our lady of guadalupe (mexico) and our lady of charity (cuba).
the right altar is presided by the risen jesus, a work by joan puigdollers, and its stained glasses are dedicated to spanish marian devotions: the virgin of almudena (madrid), the virgin of núria (catalonia), our lady of hope, our lady of the forsaken (valencia) and our lady of begoña (basque country).
the windows of the four towers contain the latin phrase tibi dabo ("i'll give you"), the name of the mountain.
at the level of the choir include founding saints: marcellin champagnat and jean-baptiste de la salle on both sides of the presbytery, and anthony mary claret, joseph calasanctius, john bosco and maria domenica mazzarello next to the main facade.
the windows of the four facades are dedicated to francis de sales, pius xi, ignatius of loyola, francisco javier, pius ix, rose of lima, leo xiii and pius xii.
the eight stained glasses of the dome depict scenes from the life of jesus.
the church is crowned by the enormous bronze statue of the sacred heart made by josep miret in 1950, replacing the original made by frederic marès in 1935, and destroyed the following year, as the spanish civil war began.
the ascent from the crypt, passing through the church and ending at the sculpture, reflects the rise and the purification of the human condition by means of sacrifice and atonement.
the crypt was designed in a neo-byzantine style, combining gothic and classical elements, and decoration close to modernisme.
the space of the crypt consists of five naves separated by columns, the central one being wider, all with semicircular apses.
the walls and vaults are lined with alabaster or decorated with mosaics, with scenes relating to the dedications of the altars: mary help of christians, saint anthony of padua, the blessed sacrament, saint joseph, and the virgin of montserrat.
polychrome alabaster is also used for the via crucis (stations of the cross) sculpted by josep miret.
the windows that bring natural light inside are complemented by stained glass windows with the following topics: the largest in the arch, in the corners, represent the appearance of the our lady of the pillar and the conversion of king reccared i to catholicism; saint ferdinand and saint hermenegild are represented in the two large vertical windows; and the small ones located above the door are dedicated to joachim, isidore the farmer, saint anthony and saint elizabeth of portugal.
from the crypt there is access to a chapel dedicated to the perpetual adoration, excavated into the mountain in the late 1940s, consisting of three naves divided by columns.
the interior is decorated with marble, mosaics in the pavement, and paintings by miquel farré i albagés in the vaults, made between 1947-1949.
outside of the crypt, on either side of the main door, are two staircases leading to the level of the temple itself.

the monument to matvei platov (russian: памятник матвею ивановичу платову) is the first sculpture constructed in novocherkassk, rostov oblast, russia.
it is dedicated to matvei ivanovich platov, who was a famous don ataman, the founder of novocherkassk, general of the cavalry and a hero of the patriotic war of 1812.
the monument to matvei platov was first established one hundred years after his birth, on may 9, 1853, in the city of novocherkassk, during the reign of nicholas i. this monument was built by the famous sculptor peter clodt von jürgensburg and architect a.i.ivanov.
it was placed at atamansky garden square in the city center, in front of the ataman palace.
70 years later, in 1923, by decree of the council of people's commissars "on the removal of monuments erected in honor of the tsars and their servants..." issued on april 12, 1918, the monument was taken from its pedestal and transferred to novocherkassk museum.
in 1925, on the same place was constructed a monument to vladimir lenin.
in 1933, the monument to platov was melted for bearings at the novocherkassk machine-building plant.
in 1993, another monument that looks alike the original version was erected at the same place.
however, its outlook is not completely authentic: there is no metal fence around it, no canons, and the fountain has also not been restored in its original form.

samuel sullivan "sunset" cox (september 30, 1824 – september 10, 1889) was an american congressman and diplomat.
he represented both ohio and new york in the united states house of representatives, and also served as united states ambassador to the ottoman empire.
cox was the grandson of new jersey congressman james cox.
he was named for his maternal grandfather, samuel sullivan, who was ohio state treasurer in 1820–1823.
cox attended ohio university and brown university, graduating from brown in 1846.  he practiced law in zanesville and became the owner and editor of the ohio statesman, a newspaper in columbus, ohio.
in 1855, he was secretary of the u.s. legation to peru.
cox was elected to congress as a democrat in 1856, and served three terms representing ohio's 12th congressional district and one representing the 7th district.
after giving an impassioned speech in 1864 denouncing republicans for allegedly supporting miscegenation (see miscegenation hoax), he was defeated for reelection and moved to new york city, where he resumed law practice.
"as slavery was already dead by the bullet, i figured it would be better to stop the bloodshed," he told a crowd seven years later.
that mattered more than "the mere empty, abstract ceremonial of burying the dead corpse of slavery."
he returned to congress after winning election in 1868 to new york's 6th congressional district.
he served two terms, was defeated by lyman tremain in the new york state election, 1872, running for congress at-large on the state ticket, but was elected to the vacant congressional seat of the late james brooks in 1873.  cox was then re-elected six times.
in may 1885, cox resigned his congressional seat to accept appointment by president grover cleveland as u.s. ambassador to the ottoman empire, succeeding lew wallace.
after serving for a year as ambassador, he ran for congress yet again, in a special election to fill the term of joseph pulitzer, who had resigned his seat; cox was once again elected and served from the lower west side of manhattan until his death on september 10, 1889.  during his last term, he was chairman of the house democratic caucus.
tammany hall elected cox to congress in new york, and it kept him there, but he was never part of the stealing.
"mr. cox is ... almost the only honest man i know who passed through a portion of the tweed ring period," another politician said later.
cox was a supporter of civil service reform and westward expansion.
in 1858, he was one of the democrats who broke with the buchanan white house and opposed admitting kansas as a state under the lecompton constitution.
later, he became a powerful critic of high tariffs — a stand that played well with his merchant constituents in a leading commercial city — and a supporter of railroad regulation.
whimsically, he suggested that those keeping the high tariff duty on coal should lay a heavy duty on the sun, as a dangerous competitor in warming people up.
he was a backer of the life saving service, later merged into the united states coast guard.
he was also known as the "letter carriers' friend" because of his support for paid benefits and a 40-hour work week for u.s. post office employees.
in gratitude, postal workers raised $10,000 in 1891 to erect a memorial statue to cox in new york city.
made by sculptor louise lawson, it was originally placed near his home on east 12th street but was later moved to its present location in tompkins square park.
it depicts cox orating and has been criticized as a poor likeness.
he was known as an eloquent public speaker, though his wife wrote many of his speeches.
his nickname "sunset" came from a particularly florid description of a sunset in an article in the ohio statesman.
james h. baker, then the editor of the scioto gazette, a whig newspaper in chillicothe, gave him the title "by reason of a highly wrought and sophomoric editorial on a flaming sunset after a great storm."
cox wrote several books including why we laugh, a buckeye abroad (1852), eight years in congress, from 1857 to 1865 (1865) and three decades of federal legislation, 1855-1885 (1885).
his colleagues appreciated him most for his ready sense of humor, usually gentle rather than cutting.
indeed, some of them thought that his joking quality may have kept him from becoming speaker of the house, because, for all his hard work and studious habits, he was not taken seriously.
"in his political action he seemed more anxious to annoy his opponents than to extinguish them," congressman george s. boutwell of massachusetts wrote, in a typical dismissal.
"his speeches were short, pointed and entertaining.
he was a favorite with the house, but his influence upon its action was very slight.
those who acquire and retain power are the earnest and persistent men.
when cox had made his speech and expended his jokes he was content.
the fate of a measure did not much disturb or even concern him."
others who served longer with him realized that cox also had the grit and parliamentary skill to make a formidable adversary in debate.
speaker of the house thomas brackett reed said, "in action he was a whole skirmish line, and has covered more movements of the democratic party, and led it out of more parliamentary pitfalls than any of its orators and all its leaders put together."

monument to aleksei shein (russian: памятник а.м.

on 30–31 august 1941, the city of taganrog was bombed by luftwaffe planes.
on 15 september 1941, the rostov oblast communist party committee gave instructions for the organization of defense and underground resistance in case of occupation.
a municipal defense committee was established in taganrog, which controlled the evacuation of the population and military equipment from defense factories.
the defense was held by 31st rifle division (soviet union) under command of mikhail ozimin and the 44th home guards detachment.

the gunboat "krenkel" was heavily damaged and sunk in the haven of the taganrog seaport.
during the occupation, the local government system was replaced by bürgermeisteramt or "new russian local government" and the city was divided into 4 police sectors controlled by "ortskommendatur" and personally by ss-sturmbannführer dr. kurt christmann of einsatzkommando sonderkommando 10a.

taganrog was an important city and was paid considerable attention by german intelligence services.
it was due not only to strategic objects, such as seaport, aerodrome, train stations or developed industry, but also to the fact that the city was located on the azov sea with hospitals and a spa center that could provide comfortable staying conditions for personnel.
the following special services were stationed in taganrog in 1941–1943:
the ss einsatzgruppe sonderkommando 10a performed systematic genocide of taganrog citizens from the first days of occupation.
the large groups of citizens (old men, women, communists, young communists, gypsies, jews, and anyone suspected in aiding the resistance movement) were taken from vladimirskaya plaza in taganrog to petrushino village (near beriev), where they were shot to death in the gully of petrushino (todesschlucht).
the massacres in taganrog started with the final solution of the jewish question.
on october 22, 1941 the ortskommendant issued an order for all jewish people to wear a star of david sign and to register themselves at the ortskommendatur.
it was followed by an appeal to the jewish population of taganrog signed by the ortskommendant alberti.
the "appeal" was calling all jews to gather themselves on october 29, 1941 at 8:00 am on vladimirskaya plaza in taganrog from where they were supposed to be taken to a ghetto.
ortskommendant alberti explained this measure as necessary due to an alleged rise of antisemitism among the local population, and that the german police and gestapo would better manage the question if the jewish population were separated into a certain district of the city:
in order to implement this measure, the jews of both sexes and of all ages, including the persons born of marriages between jews and not-jews must be present on wednesday, october 29, 1941 at 8 o'clock in the morning at vladimirskaya ploshad of taganrog.all jews must carry documents and hand in the keys to currently occupied houses and flats.
a pasteboard tag with full names and full address must be attached to the keys by a wire or a lace.
we highly recommend the jews to take with them all valuables and cash...(excerpt)
on october 29, 1941 all jews of taganrog (around 2,500 people) were gathered on vladimirskaya plaza, promptly registered at the building of the school no.27 in front of vladimirskaya plaza and taken by trucks to the gully of petrushino near the beriev aircraft factory, where they were shot to death by schutzmannschaft collaborators under control of otto ohlendorf's einsatzgruppe d. of all the jewish children who lived in taganrog in 1941 only a 14-year-old boy volodya kobrin (russian: кобрин, владимир моисеевич) managed to escape certain death thanks to the help of various people in taganrog, and especially anna mikhailovna pokrovskaya, who was awarded the title of righteous among the nations by professor alisa shenar, ambassador of israel in russia on july 19, 1996.
on august 21, 1943, one week prior to taganrog's liberation by the red army, 80 citizens (workers, women and young people) were shot to death on the seashore of gulf of taganrog, on spit of petrushino.
according to the information of the state archive, some 7,000 taganrogers (1,500 of them children of various age) were shot to death in the gully of petrushino.
in june 1943, all the children of the taganrog children's home were evacuated by the nazis to verkhnyaya lepetiha village of kherson oblast to be used as involuntary blood donors for wounded officers and soldiers.
they were delivered by groups to a german naval hospital ship on the dniepr, where their blood was taken and the dead bodies were afterwards thrown into the river.
twenty-two children were found by mere chance by the military intelligence guards sergeant vladimir tsibulkin (formerly worker of the taganrog combine-harvester factory) and were saved from poisoning planned by ss by an attack of the 301st rifle division (soviet union) on february 8, 1944.
the front-line cameraman and stalin prize winner vladimir sushinskiy filmed a documentary on the salvation of these children.
from the first days, the occupation regime started deportation of the citizens to nazi germany for forced hard labour.
nazi germany needed workforce, and the population census held by germans in occupied taganrog in february 1942 revealed possibilities for displacing citizens into germany or the occupied territories.
the bürgermeisteramt organized a labour exchange in the building of the municipal school no.8.
the first mass deportations through this organization took place in april 1942. the people were convoyed on foot by the police and military to primorskoe village near mariupol, and further taken by train to stalino, where the central "distribution center" for ost-arbeiters in the south was located.
a file with photographs and fingerprints for each taganroger sent for work in germany was produced.
the file documented the possibilities for his/her use depending on age, profession and health condition.
the second wave of mass deportations was in june–august 1943. only within 40 days (from june 11 to july 20, 1943) 10 "shipments" of people to stalino were made by trucks totaling 6762 people, 4043 of them being small children.
from october 22 to august 29, 1943 some 27,000 zwangsarbeiters or ost-arbeiters were forced to leave taganrog and were displaced into germany or other occupied territories, including concentration camps.

fascist atrocities discovered at gully of petrushino, sept. 1, 1943
at least two soviet partisans groups, organized by the nkvd, acted in taganrog before the soviet troops left the city and in november 1941, semion morozov organized an underground resistance group, which consisted mainly of young komsomol members.
the members of the two groups acted separately and were not permitted to go into contact.
as of early december 1941 only 11 young people were members of the taganrog resistance movement, while in early 1943 more than 500 people who were divided into 27 partisan groups acted against occupation forces in taganrog.
on february 18, 1943 semion morozov was arrested.
the core of the underground movement's activists were arrested in may 1943, quickly prosecuted and shot to death at gully of petrushino.
after several arrests in february–may 1943 some 200 members of the taganrog resistance movement were arrested, tortured and killed (including 27 women and 2 children).
126 members of the taganrog resistance movement were awarded with orders and medals, the commissar of the taganrog's underground semion morozov was posthumously made hero of the soviet union.
soon after the occupation of taganrog in 1941, the existing soviet militsiya was transformed into a military collaborationist auxiliary police under the name of "russian auxiliary police" (russian: русская вспомогательная полиция), also referred to as russian schutzmannschaft or "hilfspolizei".
its main difference from the soviet service was that besides the criminal department, it had a "political" department, which was aimed at suppression and extermination of nazi germany's enemies: soviet partisans, underground groups, soviet activists, jews, communists, komsomol members, nkvd agents, etc.
the political department of the police was controlled directly by sicherheitsdienst sd-10 and later by sd-6, and closely cooperated with geheimfeldpolizei.
by march 1943 the schutzmannschaft's personnel in taganrog nearly doubled in comparison with that of the soviet militsiya, and reached around 600 policemen.
the "russian auxiliary police" was directly involved in all punitive operations and formed part of the killing squads, including the gully of petrushino, and in arrests of young activists of the taganrog underground resistance movement.
the first chief of russian auxiliary police was yuriy kirsanov, who was replaced by boris vasilievich stoyanov of bulgarian origin on may 20, 1942. the criminal department of the police was located at ulitsa grecheskaya 9; the political dept.
was located on frunze street, 16. in 1942 both institutions were relocated into the former "palace of pioneers" on petrovskaya str.
after their defeat at the battle of stalingrad, the german military command started to strengthen its defense lines.
the defense lines "mius-front" along the mius river had been created under command of general paul ludwig ewald von kleist back in october 1941. by summer 1943 the mius-front consisted of three defense lines with a total depth of the mius defense range of 40–50 kilometers.
the defense was held by the 6th army (wehrmacht) under command of general karl-adolf hollidt.
on august 29, 1943 the 4th guards cavalry corps of lieutenant-general nikolai kirichenko (russian: кириченко, николай яковлевич) breached the german defense line near veselo-voznesenovka village and reached the azov sea, cutting the retreat ways from taganrog to mariupol.
however, by this time the main forces had already been evacuated from taganrog.
only mine-layer parties were left in the city, and the sambek heights were held by the 111th infantry division (nazy germany) under command of general hermann recknagel.
taganrog was liberated on august 30, 1943 by soviet army's 130th rifle division under command of konstantin sychev (ru:сычёв, константин васильевич) and 416th rifle division under command of dmitri syzranov (russian: сызранов дмитрий михайлович).
on august 30, 1943 generalissimo marshal of the soviet union joseph stalin gave the order to general fyodor tolbukhin to name the 130th rifle division and 416th rifle division after the city of taganrog, and on august 30 at 7:30 pm to fire a salute of twenty salvoes in honor of the glorious troops who liberated the rostov oblast and taganrog.
on september 1, 1943 the mass grave of citizens murdered in the gully of petrushino taganrog was publicly examined.
the secretary of the taganrog city communist party committee alexander zobov held a speech before the gathered citizens.
the medical commission permitted the exhumation of 31 dead bodies from the upper level.
in difficult conditions, the factories gradually restored the production important for the victory over nazi germany.
in october 1943 the taganrog pipe factory and the boiler factory "krasny kotelshchik" resumed their work.
the citizens of taganrog collected money for the construction of a tank column taganrog, which was built from that money and given over to the army of general pavel rybalko.
some of these tanks with inscriptions taganrog participated at the battle of berlin.
the school students of taganrog collected money for a petlyakov pe-2 dive bomber (developed by taganroger vladimir petlyakov).
the aircraft was given the name the taganrog's pioneer (russian: таганрогский пионер) and was given over to the 135th taganrog guards bomber aviation regiment (russian: 135-й гвардейский бомбардировочный таганрогский краснознаменный орденов кутузова и александра невского авиационный полк) on may 19, 1944, the birthday of the all-union pioneer organization.
taganrog was conferred the status of city of military glory by the president of the russian federation dmitriy anatolyevich medvedev on november 3, 2011, for "courage, endurance and mass heroism, exhibited by defenders of the city in the struggle for the freedom and independence of the motherland".on may 8, 2015 the stella of military glory was inaugurated in taganrog.

the monument to alexander ii, officially called the monument to emperor alexander ii, the liberator tsar, is a memorial of emperor alexander ii of russia, situated in the immediate surroundings of the cathedral of christ the saviour in moscow.
completed in 2005 and partly inspired by a destroyed imperial monument from 1898, the statue itself was paid for by private donations, with the rest of the monument mainly financed by public funding.
the site for the new monument was chosen in part because alexander helped lay the foundation for the original christ the savior cathedral (destroyed in 1931 by soviet leader joseph stalin) and ruled during its construction.
the first monument to alexander ii stood above the kremlin's taynitsky gardens and could easily be seen from the zamoskvorechye district across the moscow river.
work on the monument was begun under emperor alexander iii in 1893, and was completed five years later under emperor nicholas ii in 1898. the monument was the work of sculptor alexander opekushin, artist peter zhukovsky and architect nicholas v. sultanov.
the memorial consisted of a life-size bronze sculpture of alexander ii, set on a square pedestal with the words "to emperor alexander ii by the love of the people" engraved on it.
the sculpture was shaded by a canopy of polished dark red carelian granite.
the top of the canopy was made of specially fitted gilded bronze sheets with green enamel.
on three sides - the exception being the side facing the chudov monastery, ascension convent and the maly nikolayevsky palace (all of which were demolished for the enlargement of the ivanovskaya square in the 1930s), the monument was surrounded by a gallery with arches and openwork.
thirty-three mosaic portraits of russia’s rulers from prince vladimir to emperor nicholas ii based on sketches by artist peter zhukovsky were placed in the gallery's vaults.
it  was demolished in the summer of 1918 during the bolshevik revolution, while the columns and gallery stood forlornly overlooking the high bank of the moskva river until the end of the 1920s.

old monument
on june 2, 2004 moscow mayor yuri luzhkov signed a decree about the erection of a new monument to the emperor alexander ii in moscow.
the monument envisages the full height figure of the emperor — 5 meters high and standing on a 5-meter pedestal.
the new monument is located in a slope, made use of it in such a way that, from one side, the emperor is elevated on a pedestal and, from the other side, it seems that the emperor is standing right on the ground, portraying a man who is just standing and looking into the distance, facing the cathedral.
the memorial was designed by professor alexander rukavishnikov, a member of the russian academy of arts and national sculptor of russia.
at first, the monument was supposed to be set by the kremlin's kutafya tower; however, a new place was found for it around christ the savior cathedral.
the moscow government reserved 60 million rubles for financing works on design, making of the granite pedestal, setting of the monument and finishing of the surrounding territory.
on june 7, 2005 alexius ii, patriarch of moscow and all russia, performed the consecration of the new monument.
alexander ii is probably best known for his 1861 order to end serfdom, and an inscription on the monument listing his accomplishments says he "freed millions of peasants from centuries of slavery".
the inscription on the memorial mentions alexander's military, judicial and administrative reforms, changes aimed at establishing a more western-style system based on elements such as the rule of law and individual rights.
it incorrectly claims that he ended the war in the caucasus, a reference to the 1859 capture of imam shamil, the warlord who led longstanding resistance to russian rule in the region.
the monument also claims that alexander freed slavs from "the ottoman yoke", a reference to the balkan war against turkey in the 1870s.

and quiet flows the don or quietly flows the don (russian: тихий дон, literally "quiet don") is an epic novel in four volumes by russian writer mikhail alexandrovich sholokhov.
the first three volumes were written from 1925 to 1932 and published in the soviet magazine oktyabr in 1928–1932, and the fourth volume was finished in 1940. the english translation of the first three volumes appeared under this title in 1934.
the novel is considered one of the most significant works of world and russian literature in the 20th century.
it depicts the lives and struggles of don cossacks during the first world war, the russian revolution, and russian civil war.
in 1965, sholokhov was awarded the nobel prize for literature for this novel.
the authorship of the novel is contested by some literary critics and historians, who believe that it mostly was not written by sholokhov.
the novel deals with the life of the cossacks living in the don river valley during the early 20th century, probably around 1912, just prior to world war i. the plot revolves around the melekhov family of tatarsk, who are descendants of a cossack who, to the horror of many, took a turkish captive as a wife during the crimean war.
she is accused of witchcraft by melekhov's superstitious neighbors, who attempt to kill her but are fought off by her husband.
their descendants, the son and grandsons, who are the protagonists of the story, are therefore often nicknamed "turks".
nevertheless, they command a high amount of respect among people in tatarsk.
[citation needed]
the second eldest son, grigori panteleevich melekhov, is a promising young soldier who falls in love with aksinia, the wife of stepan astakhov, a family friend.
stepan regularly beats her and there is no love between them.
grigori and aksinia's romance and elopement raise a feud between her husband and his family.
the outcome of this romance is the focus of the plot as well as the impending world and civil wars which draw up the best young cossack men for what will be two of russia's bloodiest wars.
the action moves to the austro-hungarian front, where grigory ends up saving stepan's life, but that doesn't end the feud.
grigory, at his father's insistence, takes a wife, natalya, but still loves aksinia.
the book deals not only with the struggles and suffering of the cossacks but also the landscape itself, which is vividly brought to life.
there are also many folk songs referenced throughout the novel.
[citation needed] and quiet flows the don grew out of an earlier, unpublished work, the donshina:
i began the novel by describing the event of the kornilov putsch in 1917. then it became clear that this putsch, and more importantly, the role of the cossacks in these events, would not be understood without a cossack prehistory, and so i began with the description of the life of the don cossacks just before the beginning of world war i.
(quote from m.a.
sholokhov: seminarii, (1962) by f.a.
abramovic and v.v.
gura, quoted in mikhail aleksandrovich sholokhov, by l.l.
litus.)
grigori melekhov is reportedly based on two cossacks from veshenskaya, pavel nazarovich kudinov and kharlampii vasilyevich yermakov, who were key figures in the anti-bolshevist struggle of the upper don.
the novel has been compared to war and peace (1869), written by leo tolstoy.
[citation needed]  like the tolstoy novel, and quiet flows the don is an epic picture of russian life during a time of crisis and examines it through political, military, romantic, and civilian lenses.
[citation needed] sholokhov was accused by solzhenitsyn and others, amongst them svetlana alliluyeva (the daughter of stalin) and natalia belinkova,[who?]
of plagiarizing the novel.
an investigation in the late 1920s had upheld sholokhov's authorship of "silent don" and the allegations were denounced as malicious slander in pravda.
[citation needed]
during the second world war, sholokhov's archive was destroyed in a bomb raid, and only the fourth volume survived.
sholokhov had his friend vassily kudashov, who was killed in the war, look after it.
following kudashov's death, his widow took possession of the manuscript, but she never disclosed the fact of owning it.
the manuscript was finally found by the institute of world literature of russian academy of sciences in 1999 with assistance from the russian government.
the writing paper dates back to the 1920s: 605 pages are in sholokhov's own hand, evidencing considerable re-drafting and re-organising of the material by sholokhov, and 285 are transcribed by his wife maria and sisters.
however, there are claims that the manuscript is just a copy of the manuscript of fyodor kryukov, the true author.
statistical analysis of sentence lengths in and quiet flows the don gives full support to sholokhov.
the novel won the stalin prize in 1941 and its author won the nobel prize in 1965.
the novel has been adapted for the screen four times: a 1931 film by ivan pravov and olga preobrazhenskaya; a second, 1958 adaption was directed by sergei gerasimov and starred elina bystritskaya and pyotr glebov.
in 1992–1993 a remake was directed by sergei bondarchuk (starring rupert everett); the film was not finished until 2006, when fyodor bondarchuk completed the editing, and was shown on russian television as a seven-part miniseries.
a shorter, 3-hours version of bondarchuk's and quiet flows the don was released on dvd in several countries.
in 2015 the novel has been adapted again more comprehensively as a 14-part tv-series, directed by sergey ursulyak.
ivan dzerzhinsky based his opera quiet flows the don (tikhiy don) on the novel, with the libretto adapted by his brother leonid.
premiered in october 1935, it became wildly popular after stalin saw and praised it a few months later.
the opera was proclaimed a model of socialist realism in music and won dzerzhinsky a stalin prize.
the lyrics for the folk song "where have all the flowers gone?"
by pete seeger and joe hickerson were adapted from a cossack folk song mentioned in and quiet flows the don.

this text, written in the style of revolutionary romanticism, however, has only been partially preserved.
the fragment of the angel-warrior's head is lost: soft sandstone slowly collapses when snow melts after winter.
the monument was temporarily preserved with cement milk, because of what the color was distorted, so an urgent restoration work is necessary.

the monument of states was conceived as a symbol of american unity after the attack on pearl harbor, and is located at 300 e. monument avenue in kissimmee, florida.
it was built by volunteers, with donations of stone that came from around the world, including a rock from president franklin d. roosevelt.
it was the brainchild of charles w. bressler-pettis, who also hoped it would become a unique tourist attraction for the city.
when the united states came under attack from the empire of japan on december 7, 1941, charles w. bressler-pettis was a retired physician living in florida, and was president of the kissimmee all-states tourist club that catered to senior citizens.
he had served in both the royal army medical corps and the united states army during world war i. pettis devised an idea to erect a unique monument in kissimmee that he hoped would inspire american solidarity in response to the attack.
as a promoter of local tourism, pettis was also looking to draw visitors to kissimmee with a unique attraction.
he enlisted his friend j. c. fisher to work with him on designing a monument that would contain a rock from each state.
the result of pettis's collaboration with fisher was a step-pyramid weighing an estimated 100,000 pounds and reinforced with 3 ½ tons of steel rails.
at the top sits an american eagle and a flag of the united states, resting on a blue concrete orb.
speculation has been offered by the national park service and others that it is possible pettis might have been influenced by the fireplace of states in bemidji, minnesota.
built by the works progress administration in 1934–35, the bemidji fireplace was constructed with stones from each of the then 48 states (alaska and hawaii were considered territories at the time of the monument's construction and world not become states until 1959 and 1960 respectively).
the florida monument was built entirely through volunteer labor, mostly the senior citizens of the travel club.
governors of each state received letters from pettis asking for rock donations to build the monument.
local government and civic organizations, as well as area businesses and individual residents, donated time and materials, including 507 donations of one bag of cement each.
those in kissimmee who contributed in any manner have their names inscribed on the adjacent sidewalk.
pettis had amassed a collection of thousands of rocks in his travels and donated many of them to the project.
president franklin d. roosevelt donated a rock from his estate in new york.
by the time of its 1943 completion and dedication by florida's united states senator claude pepper, it was composed of 1,500 stones and objects donated from all over the world.
when pettis died in 1954, kissimmee changed its regulations on burials to permit a portion of his remains to be sealed inside the work.
a plaque honoring pettis was placed on the monument.

la violetera is a copla song, with the rhythm of a habanera, composed by josé padilla in 1914 with lyrics by eduardo montesinos and interpreted and popularized by the spanish singer raquel meller.
in spanish, "violetera" is a girl or woman who sells violets in the street.
the song was composed by josé padilla during his stay in paris as director of the orchestra of the casino de paris music hall.its premiere took place in barcelona, however, with an interpretation by carmen flores.
then the singer raquel meller popularized the song among the french and spanish public first, and later worldwide.
another popular spanish interpreter is sara montiel.
la violetera is also in the repertoire of, among others, montserrat caballé, dalida, gigliola cinquetti, nana mouskouri, connie francis, mieczysław fogg.
movies using la violetera include city lights (1931) by charles chaplin with him and virginia cherrill; la violetera (1958) by luis césar amadori with sara montiel;  all night long (1981) by jean-claude tramont with barbra streisand and gene hackman; scent of a woman (1992) by martin brest with al pacino; in the mood for love (2000) by wong kar wai, named on the soundtrack "lan hua nu" and sung by rebecca pan (recorded in 1949); or raji en kanmani (1954 tamil film), named on the soundtrack "malligai poo jathi rojaa", where it is sung by balasaraswathi and combined with la paloma.
in 1991 a statue of a flower-seller was unveiled in madrid, entitled la violetera, by sculptor santiago de santiago, commemorating josé padilla, the author of the song.
since 2003, it is in los jardines de las vistillas, madrid (40°24′45″n 3°42′53″w  /  40.412607°n 3.714685°w  / 40.412607; -3.714685).
in 1926 anselmo aieta wrote a tango  to lyrics by francisco garcía jiménez, where the refrain is a straight borrowing of la violetera's theme.
among the most famous adaptations is the one by charles chaplin in his 1931 film city lights.
the main theme used as a leitmotif for the blind flower-seller is the song "la violetera" ("who’ll buy my violets").
chaplin was unable to secure the original song performer, raquel meller, in the lead role, but used her song anyway as a major theme.
in 1934, chaplin lost a lawsuit to padilla (which took place in paris, where padilla then lived) for not crediting him.
some modern editions released for video include a new recording by carl davis.
sung in french by dalida, it was released in 1956 and it is first well quality release of song on vinyl.
it was included on her 1956 ep la violetera that reached #10 on 1956 charts and remained there for 14 weeks.
it was included also on her first album son nom est dalida in 1957.
the version performed by sara montiel also became very famous, in the film also called the violet seller (1958), directed by luis césar amadori.
the instrumental version is popular as a tango.
the national museum of anthropology (spanish: museo nacional de antropología, mna) is a national museum of mexico.
it is the largest and most visited museum in mexico.
located in the area between paseo de la reforma and mahatma gandhi street within chapultepec park in mexico city, the museum contains significant archaeological and anthropological artifacts from mexico's pre-columbian heritage, such as the stone of the sun (or the aztec calendar stone) and the aztec xochipilli statue.
the museum (along with many other mexican national and regional museums) is managed by the instituto nacional de antropología e historia (national institute of anthropology and history), or inah.
it was one of several museums opened by mexican president adolfo lópez mateos in 1964..
assessments of the museum vary, with one considering it "a national treasure and a symbol of identity.
the museum is the synthesis of an ideological, scientific, and political feat."
octavio paz criticized the museum's making the mexica (aztec) hall central, saying the "exaltation and glorification of mexico-tenochtitlan transforms the museum of anthropology into a temple."
designed in 1964 by pedro ramírez vázquez, jorge campuzano, and rafael mijares alcérreca, the monumental building contains exhibition halls surrounding a courtyard with a huge pond and a vast square concrete umbrella supported by a single slender pillar (known as "el paraguas", spanish for "the umbrella").
the halls are ringed by gardens, many of which contain outdoor exhibits.
the museum has 23 rooms for exhibits and covers an area of 79,700 square meters (almost 8 hectares) or 857,890 square feet (almost 20 acres).
at the end of the 18th century, by order of the viceroy of bucareli, the items that formed part of the collection by lorenzo boturini — including the sculptures of coatlicue and the sun stone — were placed in the royal and pontifical university of mexico, forming the core of the collection that would become the national museum of anthropology.
on august 25, 1790, the cabinet of curiosities of mexico (gabinete de historia natural de méxico)[note 1] was established by botanist josé longinos martínez.
during the 19th century, the museum was visited by internationally renowned scholars such as alexander von humboldt.
in 1825, the first mexican president, guadalupe victoria, advised by the historian lucas alamán, established the national mexican museum as an autonomous institution.
in 1865, the emperor maximilian moved the museum to calle de moneda 13, to the former location of the casa de moneda.
in 1906, due to the growth of the museum's collections, justo sierra divided the stock of the national museum.
the natural history collections were moved to the chopo building, which was constructed specifically to shelter permanent expositions.
the museum was renamed the national museum of archaeology, history and ethnography, and was re-opened september 9, 1910, in the presence of president porfirio díaz.
by 1924 the stock of the museum had increased to 52,000 objects and had received more than 250,000 visitors.
in december 1940, the museum was divided again, with its historical collections being moved to the chapultepec castle, where they formed the museo nacional de historia, focusing on the viceroyalty of the new spain and its progress towards modern mexico.
the remaining collection was renamed the national museum of anthropology, focusing on pre-columbian mexico and modern day mexican ethnography.
the construction of the contemporary museum building began in february 1963 in the chapultepec park.
the project was coordinated by architect pedro ramírez vázquez, with assistance by rafael mijares alcérreca and jorge campuzano.
the construction of the building lasted 19 months, and was inaugurated on september 17, 1964, president adolfo lópez mateos, who declared:
the mexican people lift this monument in honor of the admirable cultures that flourished during the pre-columbian period in regions that are now territory of the republic.
in front of the testimonies of those cultures, the mexico of today pays tribute to the indigenous people of mexico, in whose example we recognize characteristics of our national originality.
the film museo tells the story of the famous robbery to the national museum of anthropology on december 25, 1985, in mexico city.
the museum's collections include the stone of the sun, giant stone heads of the olmec civilization that were found in the jungles of tabasco and veracruz, treasures recovered from the maya civilization, at the sacred cenote at chichen itza, a replica of the sarcophagal lid from pacal's tomb at palenque and ethnological displays of contemporary rural mexican life.
it also has a model of the location and layout of the former aztec capital tenochtitlan, the site of which is now occupied by the central area of modern-day mexico city.
the permanent exhibitions on the ground floor cover all pre-columbian civilizations located on the current territory of mexico as well as in former mexican territory in what is today the southwestern united states.
they are classified as north, west, maya, gulf of mexico, oaxaca, mexico, toltec, and teotihuacan.
the permanent expositions at the first floor show the culture of native american population of mexico since the spanish colonization.
the museum also hosts visiting exhibits, generally focusing on other of the world's great cultures.
past exhibits have focused on ancient iran, greece, china, egypt, russia, and spain.

the battle of liberty place monument is a stone obelisk on an inscribed plinth, formerly on display in new orleans, in the u.s. state of louisiana, commemorating the "battle of liberty place", an 1874 attempt by democratic white league  paramilitary organizations to take control of the government of louisiana from its reconstruction era republican leadership after a disputed gubernatorial election.
erected in 1891 by a white-dominated city government, the obelisk became the site of protests and rallies by both white supremacists and those who objected to it as a symbol of racism.
it was removed in 2017 amid great controversy and threats of violence and was placed in storage.
the 1872 louisiana gubernatorial election was a particularly contentious contest between democrat john mcenery and republican william pitt kellogg.
in a close contest, kellogg was declared the winner by outgoing republican henry c. warmoth.
democratic forces in the state legislature succeeded in impeaching warmoth after this action, and both kellogg and mcenery claimed victory.
kellogg's win was later certified by the federal government.
mcenery and his supporters continued to dispute the result, and in 1874 established a competing legislature.
in september 1874, a paramilitary force called the white league entered the city (then the state capital) to forcibly unseat kellogg.
on september 19, they defeated city and state police and militia in the battle of liberty place and occupied government buildings; they withdrew after president ulysses s. grant sent federal troops to the city.
in 1891, as the democratic-controlled legislature passed laws that disenfranchised most black americans, the government of the city of new orleans erected the liberty monument to "commemorate the uprising" of 1874, in the city.
the monument was prominently placed in the neutral ground (median) near the foot of canal street.
in 1932, inscriptions were added to the monument which attested to the battle's role in establishing white supremacy.
by the late 20th century, after civil rights achievements, many residents, especially in the black and italian american communities, objected to the monument as a symbol of racism.
(during the 1891 hennessy affair, a new orleans mob had lynched eleven italian men; the lynching had helped revive the stalled fundraising campaign for the liberty place monument.)
in 1965 the monument was dismantled and temporarily removed during major demolition and construction projects in the area.
already controversial, it was put back despite objections in 1970. it was subject to protests and vandalism with some regularity.
in 1974, the city government added a plaque at the foot of the monument; it acknowledged the history while officially distancing the city from the racist philosophy of previous generations.
in 1976 the naacp youth council formally called for the monument's removal.
ku klux klan and other white nationalists used the monument as a rallying point.
in 1981, new orleans mayor ernest "dutch" morial called for the monument to be removed, saying "because of what it symbolizes, has long been a source of divisiveness in our community" and "in the interest of public harmony, it is time to lay this monument to rest."
the city council blocked morial's attempt to remove the monument, but agreed to removing the inscription touting "white supremacy" in what was described as a "compromise".
in 1989, the monument was removed during major street work on canal street and many residents opposed its return.
the city tried to negotiate removing the inscriptions.
some people argued for the monument's restoration at the original location.
the content of the inscriptions was seldom discussed; rather, the issues were dealt with on technical grounds.
historic preservation officials argued for its replacement; others argued this was history that did not deserve commemoration.
on july 16, 1993, the new orleans city council voted 6 to 1 to declare the monument a nuisance.
it was taken to a warehouse, with the intention to move it to an indoor museum.
the council eventually permitted its installation at a less prominent location, a short distance off canal street (at the river end of iberville street) between the one canal place parking garage and a floodwall.
white supremacist david duke cited the monument as a symbol of "white pride" and in 2004, tried to stage a rally by it.
the monument was frequently vandalized as the target of anti-racist and anti-nazi graffiti.
it was one of three monuments vandalized in march 2012 by a group noting the divisive nature of a monument favoring a racist past.
the graffiti referenced the new orleans police department killings of justin sipp and wendell allen as well as the killing of trayvon martin.
a local businessman led his staff in cleaning up the monuments; he said that after hurricane katrina, residents needed to build the city together.
in july 2015, the charleston church shooting caused many southern states and communities to rethink the public display of confederate symbols and monuments.
the new orleans mayor mitch landrieu called for the liberty place monument and statues honoring robert e. lee and other confederate notables to be removed from prominent public spaces, explaining that "that's what museums are for".
the idea drew both support and resistance and the city council voted unanimously to hold public hearings to discuss the proposal.
in october 2016, on mischief night, a group of angry paraders converged on the monument.
the monument was covered in anti-racist graffiti and parts of the inscription were smashed with sledgehammers.
when the police tried to intervene they were attacked with paint and a bonfire was lit.
in december 2016, the council voted to remove the monument, and its move was upheld by a federal appeals court in march 2017.
under the cover of darkness because of threats of violence, the monument was removed in the early hours of april 24, 2017, a day that was observed in mississippi and alabama as confederate memorial day.
with heavy police presence, workers wore bulletproof jackets and were protected by police snipers, in the face of threats of violence.
mayor mitch landrieu stated that the statue would be moved into storage before being relocated into "a museum or other facility".
a seven-person monument relocation committee was set up by mayor latoya cantrell to advise on what to do with the removed monuments.
the battle of liberty place monument will remain in storage.
the following inscription was added in 1932:
mcenery and penn having been elected governor and lieutenant-governor by the white people, were duly installed by this overthrow of carpetbag government, ousting the usurpers, governor kellogg (white) and lieutenant-governor antoine (colored).united states troops took over the state government and reinstated the usurpers but the national election of november 1876 recognized white supremacy in the south and gave us our state.
in 1974, the city government added an adjacent marker, which stated:
although the "battle of liberty place" and this monument are important parts of the new orleans history, the sentiments in favor of white supremacy expressed thereon are contrary to the philosophy and beliefs of present-day new orleans.
when the monument was moved in 1993, some of the original inscriptions were removed, and replaced with new inscriptions that state in part:
in honor of those americans on both sides who died in the battle of liberty place ... a conflict of the past that should teach us lessons for the future.
the equestrian statue of edward horner stands inside st andrew's church in the village of mells in somerset, south-western england.
it was designed by the architect sir edwin lutyens, as a memorial to edward horner, who died of wounds in the first world war.
the sculpture was executed by alfred munnings.
edward horner was the only surviving son and heir of sir john and lady frances horner of mells manor and a member of an extended upper-class social group known as the coterie, many of whom were killed in the war; the group included his fiancée and his future brother-in-law.
shortly after the war broke out, he was a yeomanry officer in the part-time territorial force but he was keen to join the fighting on the western front and obtained a transfer to a cavalry regiment through his family's connections.
he was wounded in may 1915 and did not return to the war until early 1917. he was assigned a staff post but again secured a transfer to the front line.
shortly after his return to the fighting, on 21 november 1917, he was wounded again; he died the same day.
lutyens was a friend of the horner family, having designed multiple buildings and structures for them since the beginning of the 20th century.
as well as horner's memorial, he designed a memorial to raymond asquith (also in st andrew's church), and mells war memorial in the centre of the village.
for horner's memorial, lutyens designed the plinth himself, and engaged the renowned equestrian painter and war artist alfred munnings for the latter's first public work of sculpture.
the plinth is in portland stone and set into it is horner's original grave marker; the family's coat of arms is carved into the front, while the sides bear various dedicatory inscriptions.
the statue is a bronze of a cavalry officer on horseback, bare-headed, with his helmet and sword on the horse's saddle.
lutyens was known for abstract and ecumenical themes in his war memorial designs, but the statue of horner is an example of his use of more conventional imagery to commemorate an individual.
installed in the horner family chapel in st andrew's church in 1920 at a cost of £1,000, it was moved to its present location in the church in 2007.
edward william horner (born 3 may 1888) was the third child of sir john horner, kcvo, of mells manor, and his wife frances (née graham), and their first son.
the family was reputed to be descendants of "little jack horner", the subject of an 18th-century nursery rhyme.
sir john was a london barrister and later commissioner of woods, for which he was knighted in 1908. frances was a prominent member of the souls social group, whom she regularly hosted at mells.
edward was the last direct male heir of the horner family, his younger brother (mark) having died of scarlet fever before the war.
he was educated at summer fields school near oxford, then at eton college and balliol college, oxford, where he was a member of the officers' training corps.
at oxford, he became part of the social network known as the coterie.
the group was made up largely of heirs to aristocratic families and included raymond asquith, horner's future brother-in-law.
many of them were frequent visitors to mells manor at the beginning of the 20th century and horner was unofficially engaged to another member, lady diana manners.
horner struggled academically, graduating from oxford with only a third-class degree, much to the disappointment of his parents and particularly his mother, who concentrated all her ambitions on edward after mark's premature death.
struggling for career options, edward pursued his parents' ambition for him to become a barrister.
he was called to the bar, and began a pupillage in 1914 in the chambers of hugh fraser under the ultimate guidance of f. e. smith, one of the most distinguished barristers of the day.
like many contemporary men, especially those from aristocratic backgrounds, horner felt a keen sense of patriotism fostered by his private education and by tales from imperial campaigns around the turn of the 20th century, especially the second boer war (1899–1902).
on 19 august 1914, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the north somerset yeomanry, a part-time territorial force unit with no obligation to serve abroad.
after the outbreak of the first world war in august 1914, his regiment was ordered to hampshire for training.
unlike the men under his command, among them farmers who were reluctant to leave their land, horner was keen to join the fighting in france.
as an influential aristocratic family, the horners were able to secure him a transfer first to the royal horse guards and then, in october 1914, to the 18th (queen mary's own) hussars.
the 18th hussars were stationed at tidworth camp in wiltshire under the 11th reserve cavalry for training, after which they were deployed to the western front in early 1915.
horner arrived first at rouen, well behind the front, and then in february 1915 was ordered forward to hazebrouck on the belgian border.
in may 1915, he was assigned to escort a working party to dig trenches on the north side of the yser canal.
during the march, he was wounded in the stomach by shrapnel from an artillery shell.
hospitalised at the no.
7 general hospital at boulogne in france, he had a kidney removed, and at one point his condition was so grave that his parents were given special permission to visit him.
they were accompanied by his fiancée (lady manners) and a private doctor and nurse.
he left the hospital on 1 june and was allowed to return to mells to recuperate for the summer of 1915. eager to return to the front, horner went before a medical board in december 1915 but was told that his missing kidney rendered him ineligible for front-line duties.
he was sent again to tidworth to await orders, which arrived in january 1916, instructing him to sail for egypt.
he was promoted to temporary lieutenant in november 1916.
he was first assigned a staff post in egypt but was again able to transfer to a fighting role in france in february 1917. in october that year, the family's second home at mells park was destroyed by fire; horner was given compassionate leave in early november and returned to the village to visit his parents.
returning to france, he was given command of a troop (16 soldiers and horses).
the 18th hussars were part of the battle of cambrai, where they were holding the village of noyelles, south-east of cambrai itself.
he was hit by sniper fire on 21 november 1917 and evacuated to no.
48 casualty clearing station near ytres but died that evening.
he is buried in rocquigny-equancourt road british cemetery, maintained by the commonwealth war graves commission.
the headstone for his grave in france contains the epitaph "small time, but in that small most greatly lived this star of england", from shakespeare's henry v.
sir edwin lutyens was among the most distinguished architects in britain.
he became a nationally renowned designer of war memorials following his work as an adviser to (and later one of the principal architects for) the imperial war graves commission and his design for the cenotaph on london's whitehall.
as well as dozens of public war memorials in towns and cities across britain, lutyens designed several private memorials to individual casualties, usually the sons of friends or clients.
many were heirs to the country houses lutyens had built earlier in his career, as in mells where he renovated the manor at the beginning of the 20th century.
his work in mells arose through his friend and collaborator gertrude jekyll, who introduced him to the horners through a family connection.
lutyens established a friendship which led to multiple commissions in the village.
in addition to his work on the manor, he redesigned its gardens and worked on several related buildings and structures, and after the war was responsible for a tribute to raymond asquith (edward's brother-in-law), also located in st andrew's church, and the village war memorial.
lutyens designed two other memorials to horner: a wooden board featuring a description of the events leading up to his death, which was placed on a wall in the family chapel in st andrew's church;[n 1] and a stone tablet in cambrai cathedral.

alfred munnings was a painter specialising in horses.
he volunteered for military service at the outbreak of war but was deemed unfit due to lack of sight in one eye.
he volunteered to tend to army horses and was later recruited as a civilian war artist attached to canadian cavalry.
in 1919, he was beginning to move into sculpture.
the horner memorial was his first public work of sculpture, for which lutyens commissioned him based on a pre-existing friendship.
the work led to several further commissions for equine statues, including from the jockey club for a sculpture of the racehorse brown jack at epsom downs racecourse.
munnings produced two models in clay for review by lady horner; he worked from photographs provided by lady horner and a live model in producing the statue.
at one point, munnings was so dissatisfied with the statue's head that he cut it off and re-cast it from scratch.
the memorial stands inside st andrew's church in mells.
the horner family had a long association with the church, which shares a wall with the manor house.
the family has its own chapel (formerly the lady chapel) in the church which contains the tombs of several family members.
at the end of the nineteenth century, the horners funded extensive restoration work to the building.
the memorial is a bronze equestrian statue, sculpted by munnings, featuring edward horner as a young cavalry officer, bare-headed and seated on horseback with his sword and helmet attached to the saddle.
the statue originally faced a stained-glass window featuring a madonna and child, creating the image of horner riding towards the light.
it stands on a portland stone plinth designed by lutyens, reminiscent of his cenotaph and described by lutyens' biographer jane ridley as "deceptively simple".
the temporary memorial cross, which originally marked horner's grave in france, inscribed sacred to the memory of lieut.
e. w. horner 18th q.m.o.
hussars / died of wounds received in action nov 21st 1917", is set into the rear of the plinth while the horner family's coat of arms is moulded into the front.
the south (left) side bears the inscription edward / dear son of john horner and frances his wife who fell in action at noyelles nov 21 1917 aged twenty eight, while the north (right) side reads he hath outsoared the shadow of our night, from percy bysshe shelley's adonaïs (1821), an elegy for john keats.
according to colin amery, who chaired an exhibition of lutyens' work in the 1980s, "some of [lutyens'] finest memorials and tombs" are to be found in mells, and edward horner's memorial is one of "lutyens' best and most moving tributes to the waste of life in the great war".
in his public war memorials (particularly the cenotaph and the various memorials based on it), lutyens often used abstract and ecumenical designs, feeling that a different form of architecture was needed to convey the sense of sorrow at the enormous loss of life.
where he was commissioned to commemorate an individual, however, lutyens was more open to conventional imagery, such as a statue of an officer.
according to tim skelton, author of lutyens and the great war (2008), the horner statue is "widely considered to be one of the most moving of personal memorials to the [first world war]".
lutyens' original design for horner's memorial included pillars rising from the plinth to enclose the statue in a mausoleum, but this part of the proposal was not implemented.
munnings' mould for the statue is on display at the munnings art museum, in his former home and studio in dedham in essex.
the statue was installed in 1920. it cost over £1,000 and was by far the largest and most elaborate of the several war-related monuments in mells.
frances horner initially hoped for it to stand underneath the church's bell tower, but the suggestion prompted objections from villagers and the churchwardens, who were hesitant about having it in the church at all.
thus it was placed in the horner chapel, on the north side of the chancel.

the fucine inlet (italian: incile del fucino) is a monument built on the head of the main emissary of the fucine lake in italy.
it is made up of the three-arched bridge of the sluice gates and the about 7-metre-high (23 ft) statue of the immaculate conception rising above.
it is situated in borgo incile, a locality south of the city of avezzano, in the fucine plain, abruzzo, central italy.
the facility necessary for the drainage of the fucine lake connects the outer drainage canal to the underground emissary which is served by the system of the tunnels of claudius in mount salviano.
the monument was made in 1876 by architect carlo nicola carnevali.
the head of the main emissary of the fucine lake was made built by alessandro torlonia in 1876 following the occurred drainage of the lake.
the roman banker resumed the works and plans of 18 centuries earlier by which emperor claudius carried out the first drainage of the fucine basin after the impressive digging works of the tunnels of claudius and the roman emissary occurring between 41 ad and the year of inauguration, 52 ad.
with the fall of the roman empire a lack of facility maintenance followed, which, most probably after the effects of a serious earthquake occurring in 508 ad, favoured the clogging of the underground canal, with the resulting natural reflood of the fucine basin where the waters were soon back to the levels prior to the first drainage.
the claudian plan was resumed in an effective way starting from 1856, 18 centuries later, by alessandro torlonia who had the sections of the main emissary enlarged and further vents and inclined shafts built which served the above tunnels.
on the higher part of the tunnel, in some points, the original roman work is visible.
in 1876, having achieved the second drainage which was officially declared with a document of 1 october 1878, the roman architect of the house of torlonia, carlo nicola carnevali, built the head of the emissary, a monumental work made up of the bridge of the sluice gates and the statue of the immaculate conception, situated in borgo incile south of avezzano.
from the area of the cleaning works of the roman inlet and the nearby areas connected to the fucine territory, several items emerged: four riliefs, depicting scenes from the fucine lake and a marsian town, some inscriptions on marble plaques reporting distance measures in feet, graffiti, some work materials such as a large bucket and an oil-lamp, as well as several archaeological items such as busts, epigraphs and cappuccina tombs.
the working facility regulates the flow of the waters coming from the numerous fucine canals which pour them into the outer drainage canal.
two basins, the small loading basins, and the fares allow to regulate the waters flowing out into the emissary, the tunnel crossing mount salviano at the base for more than 6 kilometres (3.7 mi) before intersecting the course of the liri river, on the opposite side of the mountain under the town of capistrello.
the chief site engineer, french alessandro brisse, chose the materials for the construction of the work, while architect carlo nicola carnevali supervised the architectural plan, also building in 1876 the adjoining garden in addition to the monument of the emissary head.
a second emissary was had built in 1942 by the torlonia with the purpose of compensating for the main tunnel in case of extraordinary repairs.
it starts from the intersection point of the roman emissary with the outer drainage next to one of the water storage basins.
the second tunnel, built southwards, ends up in canistro next to one of the hydroelectric power plants built by the torlonia with the aim of generating power for the operation of the avezzano paper and sugar mills.
the fucine inlet is a neo-classical style work built by using local stone blocks for the main body of the building, carved out of the quarries that were located in the mountainous territory of capistrello.
it develops on two levels, the lower one below the plane of site which is almost 16 metres (52 ft) high and contains the safety systems, and the higher one which houses the engine-room.
in the centre, on a block rises the about 7-metre-high (23 ft) statue in local stone depicting the immaculate conception of the blessed virgin mary, which was re-built after the 1915 earthquake.
a crescent of moon was fixed at its base, while a twelve-star crown lies upon the virgin's head.
the bronze elements call up the biblical apocalypse.
of the original statue, which collapsed following the 1915 marsica earthquake, only some fragments remain, which are exposed in the park of villa torlonia.
the so-called madonnone dell'incile (literally, "big madonna of the inlet") rises above the three-arched bridge of the sluice gates.
the structure features two water storage basins, one with a trapezoidal shape and the other hexagonal, and three gates (or locks).
the first one separates the major hexagonal basin from the forebasin through a gorge.
the gate pillars are made up of three round arches.
two side staircases lead to the canal wharfs.

the porvenir massacre (also, el porvenir massacre, pando massacre) was a deadly ambush in the early hours of september 11, 2008, allegedly organized by prefectural authorities of the bolivian department of pando, as part of a civil coup d'état against the government of evo morales by members of the right-wing civic movement.
as a result of the ambush, at least 12 indigenous protesters of the municipality of el porvenir died that day.
it was the most deadly act of political violence in bolivia since 2003. the protesters were marching to the departmental capital of cobija to protest departmental government actions during a national political crisis.
an investigation by the union of south american nations (unasur) found the massacre to be a crime against humanity.
unasur's reported list of 19 victims was later shortened to 13 confirmed dead by bolivian prosecutors.
on august 10, 2008, a recall referendum was held in bolivia on the mandates of president evo morales, his vice-president alvaro garcia linera and eight of the nine regional prefects.
evo morales won the referendum with a 67% "yes" vote, and he and garcia linera were ratified in post.
two of the prefects, both aligned with the political opposition in the country, failed to gain enough support and had their mandates recalled with new prefects to be elected in their place.
the elections were monitored by over 400 observers, including election observers from the organization of american states, european parliament and mercosur.
after morales' victory in the recall referendum, the morales government claimed that right wing forces led by ruben costas, mario cossio, leopoldo fernandez and ernesto suarez rejected the result of the vote and on september 2008, launched a civil coup d'état, seizing public building and airports in the departments of santa cruz, beni, pando, tarija; attacking government officials and morales supporters, and calling for civil disobedience.
this included the occupation of the national institute for agrarian reform (inra)'s pando office.
campesinos, largely aligned with the morales government, feared their recently granted land titles were at risk, although in fact they were safely stored in a military barracks.

it was the most deadly act of political violence in bolivia since 2003. the protesters were marching to the departmental capital of cobija to protest departmental government actions during a national political crisis.
an investigation by unasur found the massacre to be a crime against humanity.
the event culminated in the spectacular arrest in september of the prefect of pando, leopoldo fernández, for the departmental government's role in the massacre of backers of president evo morales.
prosecutors (of the ministerio público) presented indictments against 26 people, including fernández, before the sixth sentencing tribunal (tribunal sexto de sentencia) on 12 october 2009. by that time, the number of deaths had been revised from 18 or 20 down to 13, including ramiro tiñini alvarado, a soldier who was killed at the cobija airport on 12 september 2008. the defendants are: leopoldo fernández ferreira, jorge lengua áñez, olman pino soria, rosendo domínguez deromides, melitón brito ferreira, homer polanco ventura, felsin fernández medina, william musuco rodríguez, ronald musuco rodríguez, néstor da silva rivero, danilo huari cartagena, william terrazas lópez, juan marcelo mejido flores, abel janco cáceres, adhemar herrera guerra, hugo apaza sahonero, felipe vigabriel villarroel, máximo aillón martínez, agapito vira cuéllar, oswaldo valdivia avariega, nilma banegas becerra, hugo mopi soliz, herman justiniano negrete, marcial peña toyama, roberto rea ruiz, wilson da silva ramallo y evin ventura voght.

after several years in the san pedro prison in la paz, fernández was released to house arrest in february 2013.
roberto rea ruiz, homer polanco ventura, and william terrazas lópez accepted their guilt in an abbreviated trial and were sentenced to three to six years in jail.
four others, including the former prefect, went to trial in 2015: leopoldo fernández, herman justiciano, evin ventura, and marcelo mejido.
after examination of evidence in the second half of 2015, closing arguments in the trial were held in march 2016. in march 2017, fernández was found guilty as an indirect author of homicide, and acquitted of the crimes of murder, terrorism, criminal association, and light and severe assault; he was sentenced to fifteen years in prison.
alongside him, herman justiniano was sentenced to eight years in prison; marcelo mejido (an official with the departmental road service), to five years; and evin ventura (the former mayor of porvenir), to nine years.

divankhana is a rotunda-pavilion built on a tall stylobate in the north-west of the shirvanshahs palace.
in the fifteenth century, shirvanshah was built by order of farrukh yasar.
several stories describe the divan's operation.
it is believed that it served as a court, a reception hall, a government council or a tomb.
the stylistic features and the incomplete embroidery work allow the divankhana to end at the end of the fifteenth century when the safavid armies took baku.
the origin of the original architectural structure of the building is associated with pre-islamic funeral ceremonies.
in leonard bretaniski and sara ashurbeyli's studies, the divankhana was built in the fifteenth century by the order of shirvanshah farrukh yasar.
one of the door openings at the café's pavilion was probably broken and left in unreadable arabic.
v. sysoyev claims that he read the name of khalilullah and hijri 832 (1428-1429 ce), but ashurbeyli says that this is impossible to check.
the canteen may be a memorial monument.
ashurbeyli noted that this building may have been a tomb and according to sources, the remains of the golden calf were buried there by i halilullah.
according to another assumption, the building was built by yasar as a tomb, but he was not buried here because he was buried by the gendarmes after his defeat at caban in 1500.
according to other information, the divanjan was the place where formal receptions and state council sessions were held.
these sessions were held directly in the octagonal hall of the rattan carpets decorated with the participation of the king and his officials.
the location of this place is the place where consultation is carried out.
the hall reflects the crown image, which is a symbol of statehood, with a richly carved ornament on the west facade.
its current name is the basis of the most widely held theory, that it was a reception room.
the stylistic features and the incomplete embroidery work date the divanjan to the end of the fifteenth century when the safavid armies took baku.
the clerical plan, the content of the inscription on the ground floor and entrance to the hall (quran, verses 10, 26 and 27) show that it is a memorial place.
the original architectural structure is associated with the burial customs of islam.
historian sara ashurbeyli believes that before the muslim era the site was a sacred place.
she supposed that the pits that were used were used to store the blood of dead animals.
divankhana is a twelve-headed dome with an octagonal rotor.
it combines an eight-pointed open-air eagle.
the pillars of the porch are lined with nine columns, which are individually shaped and split.
the tracks on the columns indicate that they are decorated with fine tunics.
the entrances to the divankhana are from the yard and from the street.
the western entrance is covered by a refined surface.
the center of the hall offers a quadrilateral shape with a basement staircase.
the eight-story hall is aimed at an open gallery with five facets of shaped backgrounds on the shaded columns of a specific order.
the surface of the arcades, along with the shadows, is marked with smooth profiles that form the special plastic wall.
the dome with a double contour overflowing with a contour staircase comes out of the hall.
the daymare is increasing, leaving behind the smooth roof of the shaded gallery.
the columns are combined in the rear of the rotunda, respectively, by the volume of the hall through horizontal blocks of flat stone.
the tectonics of architectural masses are marked by the constructive forms, and the large scale of the building has been adapted to all architectural elements and details.
the peculiarity of the order is individually characterized by the rarity in the general composition of the rotunda.
the column's individuality has been specifically emphasized in the architectural form of a single vertical block.
the inner interior of the rotunda is constructed in the form of a dome-shaped, transverse eight-way transitional arc with the shape of stalactites.
all interiors that are paved with scarf stones reveal the size of the architectural system and sensitivity of the material.
in the center, a corridor forms a straight line.
another is the entrance to the two southern slopes.
the eastern part of the corridor includes a small service room.
five wells occupy in the courtyard at various depths (from 3 to 15 m).
the perimeter around the square-shaped yard of the ceiling, open array galleries are located on the colloquium, which is similar to the rotunda.
the courtyard's gallery is lower than the divan's sign and is a unique backdrop of the eight-point roton's rigid stylobate.
the western arcade is dominated by a dynamic portal.
its sleeve includes a sophisticated semi-arched stalactite complex system.
a timpani on the entrance door is covered with ornaments on the surface of the stone.
the severity of the portrait of the portal is more noticeable than the elegance of the ornament.
ş. fatullayev-fikarov noted that "this is not the architectural philosophy of the eastern art, which is derived from the depth of development processes of classical speeds, but not the portals composition of the absheron architecture, which is merely at the level of excellence."

the church is inscribed on the list of georgia's immovable cultural monuments of national significance.
the korogho church stands south of the village of korogho, dusheti municipality, mtskheta-mtianeti region, on a slope of a high rocky mountain in the khada gorge in the historical province of mtiuleti.
the church is a small and architecturally simple structure, measuring 10.8 × 7.6 m. it is built of local flagstone and schist.
the elements such as vaults, conch, pilasters, piers, window frames, and cornice are made of dressed stone.
korogho is a hall church design, covered with a gable roof, its interior being divided into two naves in the western part.
the sanctuary is rectangular in plan and tripartite, all three parts vaulted with conches.
close to the church there are a three-storey defensive tower, small chapel, and ruins of several accessory structures.
an 11th-century ivory icon of the theotokos and a cross with the depiction of the savior, found in a den of the church, is now on display at the georgian national museum in tbilisi.
the church is notable for its sculptural decoration.
in the northern entrance of the church, there is a reused stone with a relief depicting three donors, one of them holding a plan of the church.
a lintel on the western façade, made of large hewn plates, is adorned with sculptures depicting various aspects of construction work, from quarrying, transporting, and finishing of the stone to the workers taking refreshment.
the scenes converge on an image of our lady of the sign at the top of the gable, while on its either side are images of work in process, including transporting building materials, which would have been a major effort given the location of the church on the top of the mountain.
the western façade also bears two inscriptions carved in a medieval georgian asomtavruli script and paleographically dated to the 12th century.

the shaheed minar (bengali: শহীদ মিনার shohid minar lit.
"martyr monument") is a national monument in dhaka, bangladesh, established to commemorate those killed during the bengali language movement demonstrations of 1952 in then east pakistan.
on 21 and 22 february 1952, students from dhaka university and dhaka medical college and political activists were killed when the pakistani police force opened fire on bengali protesters who were demanding official status for their native tongue, bengali.
the massacre occurred near dhaka medical college and ramna park in dhaka.
a makeshift monument was erected on 23 february by students of dhaka medical college and other educational institutions, but soon demolished on 24february by the pakistani police force.
the language movement gained momentum, and after a long struggle, bengali gained official status in pakistan (with urdu) in 1956. to commemorate the dead, the shaheed minar was designed and built by bangladeshi sculptors hamidur rahman in collaboration with novera ahmed.
construction was delayed by martial law, but the monument was finally completed in 1963, and stood until the bangladesh liberation war in 1971, when it was demolished completely during operation searchlight.
after bangladesh gained independence later that year, it was rebuilt.
it was expanded in 1983.
national, mourning, cultural and other activities are held each year on 21 february (ekushey february) to mark language movement day or shaheed dibas (martyrs' day), centred on the shaheed minar.
since 2000, 21 february is also recognised as international mother language day.
the first shaheed minar was built immediately after the events of 21–22 february 1952. according to dr. sayeed haider the main planner and the designer of the first shaheed minar, the decision to build it was first made by the students of dhaka medical college.
shaheed minar is situated near dhaka medical college hospital and in the dhaka university area.
it is adjacent to the mathematics department of dhaka university.
it is only 0.5 kilometres (0.3 mi) away from shahbag and 0.25 km (0.16 mi) distant from chankharpul.
shaheed minar is an outstanding monument of bangladesh.
it was built to tribute the martyrs who given up their life for language.
the main incident had been occurring inside of dhaka medical college hospital.
so a decision was taken to build a memorial adjacent to dmch.
the planning started at midnight on 22 february, and the work started the next day.
this minar was sponsored by pearu sardar, one of the old dhaka panchayet sardars, when some of the students asked his help at midnight of 22 february, to contribute the raw materials needed to build the monument.
although curfew was in place, students started building the minar in the afternoon of 23 february.
they worked through the night and finished it at dawn.
a hand written paper was attached to the minar with "shaheed smritistombho" written on it.
the original minar was on a base measuring 10.5 feet (3.2 m).
the minar was inaugurated by the father of sofiur rahman, molvi.
mahabubur rahman, who killed during the massacre.
it was demolished on 26 february by the police and pakistani army.
smaller versions of the memorial were built in other places.

two years after the first monument was destroyed by the police, a new shaheed minar (monument of martyrs) was constructed in 1954 at the same place, to commemorate the protesters who lost their lives.
this minar was inaugurated by the then professor of dhaka university and the pioneer and most prominent cultural and literary personality natyaguru nurul momen.
work on a larger monument designed by the architect hamidur rahman began in 1957 with the support of the united front government.
following the formation of local government by the united front in april 1954, the anniversary of 21 february was declared a holiday and it became possible to construct the new monument.
a foundation stone was laid in 1956. sculptor hamidur rahman created the design of shaheed minar under which construction was started in 1957.  hamidur rahman's model was a huge complex on a large area of land in the yard of dhaka medical college hostel.
the enormous design included a half-circular column to symbolise the mother with her fallen sons standing on the monument's central dais.
yellow and deep blue pieces of stained glass, symbolising eyes reflecting the sun, were also to be placed in the columns.
the marble floor was designed to reflect the moving shadows of the columns.
the basement of the minar also included a 1,500-square-foot (140 m2) fresco depicting the history of the language movement.
a railing decorated with bengali alphabet was to be constructed in front.
two footmarks coloured red and black, indicating the two opposite forces, were also in the design.
besides this a museum and a library were also included in hamidur rahman's design.
a fountain shaped like an eye was also to be constructed.
rahman specifically designed the materials of the monument to withstand the area's tropical climate.
construction started in november 1957, under the supervision of hamidur rahman and novera ahmed.
most of the work, including the basement, platform, some of the columns with the rails, footprints and some of the murals were also finished when martial law was declared in the area, and the construction was forced to a halt.
construction work was completed in 1963, leaving much of fatamatuj's design unfinished.
it was inaugurated on 21 february 1963, by the mother of abul barkat, hasina begum.
the minar was severely damaged by the pakistan army during the bangladesh liberation war in 1971. the columns were destroyed on the night of the commencement of the genocide, 25 march 1971.the pakistani army crushed the minar and placed over the rubble a signboard reading "mosque".
in 1972, a committee headed by the then president abu sayeed chowdhury was formed and renovation work began.
the original sketch was ignored, while the construction and building directorate followed the 1963 design.
the construction went quickly, according to a modified design from 1963. the murals destroyed by the pakistani army were not restored and the basement was sealed off.
hamidur rahman's original design was not approved by the directorate in the renovation work.
in the mid-eighties, the monument underwent further renovation under the supervision of the then department of architecture chief architect shm abul bashar, which extended the area of the shaheed minar premises, giving it a square shape from a triangular one.
quarters concerned[clarification needed] demanded proper implementation of the design by hamidur rahman with the help of sculptor novera ahmed and danish architect gean deleuran.
asm ismail said that because of the extension, two entrances to the basement murals were permanently closed, and after remaining in an abandoned state for 15 years, the murals had lost much of their gloss.
in the 1983 renovation, the original poor materials were lined with marble stone.
a museum and library were also featured in the original plan.
in august 2010, the high court issued eight directives for the maintenance and renovation of the shaheed minar and asked the public works department to establish a museum and a library on its premises.
despite some flaws of proportionality, the shaheed minar still stands high.
it is one of the city's most important monuments.
the shaheed minar of dhaka has a very close association with the city's cultural history.
it also happens to be one of the primary dhaka tourist attractions and is visited by thousands of tourists throughout the year.
it is one of the most well-maintained monuments in bangladesh.
special care is taken each year on the occasion of 21 february (ekushey february).
the premises are washed and cleaned thoroughly.
artists of the faculty of fine arts of dhaka university then colourfully paint the central shaheed minar premises with intricate designs.
thus the shaheed minar premises are colourful throughout the year.
the enormous design includes a half-circular arrangement of columns to symbolise the mother, with her fallen sons, standing on the monument's central dais, and the red sun shining behind.
the central shaheed minar of dhaka goes up to a height of 14 metres (46 ft) and was made with marble stones.
the stairs and barrier are highlighted in white, to create a divine look.
the fence on both sides is painted with lines from poems of legendary poets in iron letters.
as the visitors enter the monument they will find two statues of the patriots who sacrificed their lives in that heinous police firing of 1952. the marble floor was designed to reveal the moving shadows of the columns.
the basement of the shaheed minar also included a 1,500-square-foot (140 m2) mural representing the history of the language movement.
hurried repair of the shaheed minar resulted in the minar to be reconstructed incorrectly.
the height of the column was shorter and the head bent more than originally planned, and the proportions of different parts of the monument were not properly maintained.
the language movement was one of the formidable movements which has come up in the country of bangladesh, thus the central shaheed minar epitomises efforts to represent the spirit of bangladeshi nationalism and also highlight the importance of the bengali language in the social and cultural progress of the country.
as a result, the shaheed minar has a very significant place in the social and cultural mechanism of bangladesh.
at present, all national, mourning, cultural and other activities held each year, regarding 21 february, have been centred on the shaheed minar.
the shaheed minar is situated near dhaka medical college hospital and in the dhaka university area.
it is adjacent to the mathematics department of dhaka university.

the legend of saint george and the dragon tells of saint george (died 303) taming and slaying a dragon that demanded human sacrifices; the saint thereby rescues the princess chosen as the next offering.
the narrative was first set in cappadocia in the earliest sources of the 11th and 12th centuries, but transferred to libya in the 13th-century golden legend.
the narrative has pre-christian origins (jason and medea, perseus and andromeda, typhon, etc.
),  and is recorded in various saints' lives prior to its attribution to st. george specifically.
it was particularly attributed to saint theodore tiro in the 9th and 10th centuries, and was first transferred to saint george in the 11th century.
the oldest known record of saint george slaying a dragon is found in a georgian text of the 11th century.
[citation needed]the legend and iconography spread rapidly through the byzantine cultural sphere in the 12th century.
it reached western christian tradition still in the 12th century, via the crusades.
the knights of the first crusade believed that st. george, along with his fellow soldier-saints demetrius, maurice and theodore, had fought alongside them at antioch and jerusalem.
the legend was popularised in western tradition in the 13th century based on its latin versions in the  speculum historiale and the golden legend.
at first limited to the courtly setting of chivalric romance, the legend was popularised in the 13th century and became a favourite literary and pictorial subject in the late middle ages and renaissance, and it has become an integral part of the christian traditions relating to saint george in both eastern and western tradition.
the iconography of military saints theodore, george and demetrius as horsemen is a direct continuation of the roman-era "thracian horseman" type iconography.
the iconography of the dragon appears to grow out of the serpent entwining the "tree of life" on one hand, and with the draco standard used by late roman cavalry on the other.horsemen spearing serpents and boars are widely represented in roman-era stelae commemorating cavalry soldiers.a carving from krupac, serbia, depicts apollo and asclepius as thracian horsemen, shown besides the serpent entwined around the tree.
another stele shows the dioscuri as thracian horsemen on either side of the serpent-entwined tree, killing a boar with their spears.
the development of the hagiographical narrative of the dragon-fight parallels the development of iconography.
it draws from pre-christian dragon myths.
the coptic version of the saint george legend, edited by e. a. wallis budge in 1888, and estimated by budge to be based on a source of the 5th or 6th century, names  "governor dadianus", the persecutor of saint george as "the dragon of the abyss".
budge makes explicit the parallel to pre-christian myth,
i doubt much of the whole story of saint george is anything more than one of the many versions of the old-world story of the conflict between light and darkness, or ra and apepi, and marduk and tiamat, woven upon a few slender threads of historical fact.
tiamat, the scaly, winged, foul dragon, and apepi the powerful enemy of the glorious sungod, were both destroyed and made to perish in the fire which he sent against them and their fiends: and dadianus, also called the 'dragon', with his friends the sixty-nine governors, was also destroyed by fire called down from heaven by the prayer of saint george.in anticipation of the saint george iconography, first noted in the 1870s, a coptic stone fenestrella shows a mounted hawk-headed figure fighting a crocodile, interpreted by the louvre as horus killing a metamorphosed setekh.
thracian horseman with serpent-entwined tree (2nd century)
funerary relief of a roman cavalryman trampling a barbarian warrior (4th or 5th century)
fenestrella interpreted by louvre as horus on horseback spearing set in the shape of a crocodile  (4th century).
depictions of "christ militant" trampling a serpent is found in christian art of the late 5th century.
iconography of the horseman with spear overcoming evil becomes current in the early medieval period.iconographic representations of st theodore as dragon-slayer are dated to as early as the 7th century, certainly by the early 10th century (the oldest certain depiction of theodore killing a dragon is at aghtamar, dated c. 920).theodore is reported as having destroyed a dragon near euchaita in a legend not younger than the late 9th century.early depictions of a horseman killing a dragon are unlikely to represent st. george, who in the 10th century was depicted as killing a human figure, not a dragon.
the earliest image of st theodore as a horseman (named in latin) is from vinica, north macedonia and, if genuine, dates to the 6th or 7th century.
here, theodore is not slaying a dragon, but holding a draco standard.one of the vinica icons also has the oldest representation of saint george with a dragon:george stands besides a cynocephalous st. christopher, both saints treading on snakes with human heads, and aiming at their heads with spears.maguire (1996) has connected the shift from unnamed equestrian heroes used in household magic to the more regulated iconography of named saints to the closer regulation of sacred imagery following the iconoclasm  of the 730s.
in the west,  a carolingian-era depiction of a roman horseman trampling and piercing a dragon between two soldier saints with lances and shields was put on the foot of a crux gemmata,  formerly in the treasury of the basilica of saint servatius in maastricht (lost since the 18th c.).
the representation survives in a 17th-century drawing, now in the bibliothèque nationale de france in paris.
the "christianisation" of the thracian horseman iconography can be traced to the cappadocian cave churches of göreme, where frescoes of the 10th century show military saints on horseback confronting serpents with one, two or three heads.
one of the earliest examples is from the church known as mavrucan 3  (güzelöz, yeşilhisar [tr]), generally dated to the 10th century, which portrays two "sacred riders" confronting two serpents twined around a tree, in a striking parallel to the dioskuroi stela, except that the riders are now attacking the snake in the "tree of life" instead of a boar.in this example, at least, there appear to be two snakes with separate heads, but other examples of 10th-century cappadocia show polycephalous snakes.a poorly preserved wall-painting at the yılanlı kilise [tr] ("snake church") that depicts the two saints theodore and george attacking a dragon has been tentatively dated to the 10th century, or alternatively even to the mid-9th.
[need quotation to verify]
a similar example, but showing three equestrian saints, demetrius, theodore and george, is from the "zoodochos pigi" chapel in central macedonia in greece, in the prefecture of kilkis, near the modern village of kolchida, dated to the 9th or 10th century.
a 12th-century depiction of the mounted dragon-slayer, presumably depicting theodore, not george, is found in four muqarna panels in the nave of the cappella palatina in palermo.
the dragon motif was transferred to the george legend from that of his fellow soldier saint, saint theodore tiro.
the transfer of the dragon iconography from theodore, or theodore and george as "dioskuroi" to george on his own, first becomes tangible in the early 11th century.
[citation needed]  the oldest certain images of st. george combatting the serpent are still found in cappadocia.
in the well-known version from jacobus da varagine's legenda aurea (the golden legend, 1260s), the narrative episode of saint george and the dragon took place somewhere he called "silene", in libya.
silene in libya was plagued by a venom-spewing dragon dwelling in a nearby pond, poisoning the countryside.
to prevent it from affecting the city itself, the people offered it two sheep daily, then a man and a sheep, and finally their children and youths, chosen by lottery.
one time the lot fell on the king's daughter.
the king offered all his gold and silver to have his daughter spared; the people refused.
the daughter was sent out to the lake, dressed as a bride, to be fed to the dragon.
saint george by chance arrived at the spot.
the princess tried to send him away, but he vowed to remain.
the dragon emerged from the pond while they were conversing.
saint george made the sign of the cross and charged it on horseback, seriously wounding it with his lance.
[a] he then called to the princess to throw him her girdle (zona), and he put it around the dragon's neck.
when she did so, the dragon followed the girl like a "meek beast" on a leash.
[b]
the princess and saint george led the dragon back to the city of silene, where it terrified the populace.
saint george offered to kill the dragon if they consented to become christians and be baptized.
fifteen thousand men including the king of silene converted to christianity.
[c] george then killed the dragon, beheading it with his sword, and the body was carted out of the city on four ox-carts.
the king built a church to the blessed virgin mary and saint george on the site where the dragon died and a spring flowed from its altar with water that cured all disease.only the latin version involves the saint striking the dragon with the spear, before killing it with the sword.
the golden legend narrative is the main source of the story of saint george and the dragon as received in western europe, and is therefore relevant for saint george as patron saint of england.the princess remains unnamed in the golden legend version, and the name "sabra" is supplied by elizabethan era writer richard johnson in his seven champions of christendom (1596).
in the work, she is recast as a princess of egypt.
this work takes great liberties with the material, and makes st. george marry sabra,[d] and have english children, one of whom becomes guy of warwick.alternative names given to the princess in italian sources still of the 13th century are cleolinda and aia.
the saint is depicted in the style of a roman cavalryman in the tradition of the "thracian heros.
"there are two main iconographic types, the "concise" form showing only george and the dragon, and the "detailed" form also including the princess and the city walls or towers of lacia (lasia) with spectators witnessing the miracle.the "concise" type originates in cappadocia, in the 10th to 11th century (transferred from the same iconography associated with saint theodore of tiro in the 9th to 10th century).the earliest certain example of the "detailed" form may be a fresco from pavnisi (dated c. 1160), although the examples from adishi, bochorma and ikvi may be slightly earlier.

a 17th-century broadside ballad paid homage to the feat of george's dragon slaying.
titled "st. george and the dragon", the ballad considers the importance of saint george in relation to other heroes of epic and romance, ultimately concluding that all other heroes and figures of epic or romance pale in comparison to the feats of george.
the banner of st george by edward elgar is a ballad for chorus and orchestra, words by shapcott wensley (1879).the 1898 dream days by kenneth grahame includes a chapter entitled the reluctant dragon, in which an elderly saint george and a benign dragon stage a mock battle to satisfy the townsfolk and get the dragon introduced into society.

traffic signs or road signs are signs erected at the side of or above roads to give instructions or provide information to road users.
the earliest signs were simple wooden or stone milestones.
later, signs with directional arms were introduced, for example, the fingerposts in the united kingdom and their wooden counterparts in saxony.
with traffic volumes increasing since the 1930s, many countries have adopted pictorial signs or otherwise simplified and standardized their signs to overcome language barriers, and enhance traffic safety.
such pictorial signs use symbols (often silhouettes) in place of words and are usually based on international protocols.
such signs were first developed in europe, and have been adopted by most countries to varying degrees.
various international conventions have helped to achieve a degree of uniformity in traffic signing in various countries.
traffic signs can be grouped into several types.
for example, annexe 1 of the vienna convention on road signs and signals (1968), which on 30 june 2004 had 52 signatory countries, defines eight categories of signs:
in the united states, canada, ireland, australia, and new zealand signs are categorized as follows:
in the united states, the categories, placement, and graphic standards for traffic signs and pavement markings are legally defined in the federal highway administration's manual on uniform traffic control devices as the standard.
a rather informal distinction among the directional signs is the one between advance directional signs, interchange directional signs, and reassurance signs.
advance directional signs appear at a certain distance from the interchange, giving information for each direction.
a number of countries do not give information for the road ahead (so-called "pull-through" signs), and only for the directions left and right.
advance directional signs enable drivers to take precautions for the exit (e.g., switch lanes, double check whether this is the correct exit, slow down).they often do not appear on lesser roads, but are normally posted on expressways and motorways, as drivers would be missing exits without them.
while each nation has its own system, the first approach sign for a motorway exit is mostly placed at least 1,000 metres (3,300 ft) from the actual interchange.
after that sign, one or two additional advance directional signs typically follow before the actual interchange itself.
the earliest road signs were milestones, giving distance or direction; for example, the romans erected stone columns throughout their empire giving the distance to rome.
in the middle ages, multidirectional signs at intersections became common, giving directions to cities and towns.
in 1686, the first known traffic regulation act in europe is established by king peter ii of portugal.
this act foresees the placement of priority signs in the narrowest streets of lisbon, stating which traffic should back up to give way.
one of these signs still exists at salvador street, in the neighborhood of alfama.
the first modern road signs erected on a wide scale were designed for riders of high or "ordinary" bicycles in the late 1870s and early 1880s.
these machines were fast, silent and their nature made them difficult to control, moreover their riders travelled considerable distances and often preferred to tour on unfamiliar roads.
for such riders, cycling organizations began to erect signs that warned of potential hazards ahead (particularly steep hills), rather than merely giving distance or directions to places, thereby contributing the sign type that defines "modern" traffic signs.
the development of automobiles encouraged more complex signage systems using more than just text-based notices.
one of the first modern-day road sign systems was devised by the italian touring club in 1895. by 1900, a congress of the international league of touring organizations in paris was considering proposals for standardization of road signage.
in 1903 the british government introduced four "national" signs based on shape, but the basic patterns of most traffic signs were set at the 1908 international road congress in paris.
[citation needed] in 1909, nine european governments agreed on the use of four pictorial symbols, indicating "bump", "curve", "intersection", and "grade-level railroad crossing".
the intensive work on international road signs that took place between 1926 and 1949 eventually led to the development of the european road sign system.
both britain and the united states developed their own road signage systems, both of which were adopted or modified by many other nations in their respective spheres of influence.
the uk adopted a version of the european road signs in 1964 and, over past decades, north american signage began using some symbols and graphics mixed in with english.
in the u.s., the first road signs were erected by the american automobile association (aaa).
starting in 1906, regional aaa clubs began paying for and installing wooden signs to help motorists find their way.
in 1914, aaa started a cohesive transcontinental signage project, installing more than 4,000 signs in one stretch between los angeles and kansas city alone.
over the years, change was gradual.
pre-industrial signs were stone or wood, but with the development of darby's method of smelting iron using coke, painted cast iron became favoured in the late 18th and 19th centuries.
cast iron continued to be used until the mid-20th century, but it was gradually displaced by aluminium or other materials and processes, such as vitreous enamelled and/or pressed malleable iron, or (later) steel.
since 1945 most signs have been made from sheet aluminium with adhesive plastic coatings; these are normally retroreflective for nighttime and low-light visibility.
before the development of reflective plastics, reflectivity was provided by glass reflectors set into the lettering and symbols.
new generations of traffic signs based on electronic displays can also change their text (or, in some countries, symbols) to provide for "intelligent control" linked to automated traffic sensors or remote manual input.
in over 20 countries, real-time traffic message channel incident warnings are conveyed directly to vehicle navigation systems using inaudible signals carried via fm radio, 3g cellular data and satellite broadcasts.
finally, cars can pay tolls and trucks pass safety screening checks using video numberplate scanning, or rfid transponders in windshields linked to antennae over the road, in support of on-board signalling, toll collection, and travel time monitoring.
yet another "medium" for transferring information ordinarily associated with visible signs is rias (remote infrared audible signage), e.g., "talking signs" for print-handicapped (including blind/low-vision/illiterate) people.
these are infra-red transmitters serving the same purpose as the usual graphic signs when received by an appropriate device such as a hand-held receiver or one built into a cell phone.
road signs in mauritius are regulated by the traffic signs regulations 1990. they are particularly modelled on the british road signs since mauritius is a former british colony.
mauritius has left-hand traffic.
road signs in sierra leone are standardized road signs closely follow those used in italy with certain distinctions.
they are written in english.
[citation needed]
direction signs are:
hong kong's traffic signs follow the british road sign conventions and are bi-lingual in english and chinese (english on top, and traditional chinese characters at the bottom).
road signs in the republic of india are similar to those used in some parts of the united kingdom, except that they are multilingual.
most urban roads and state highways have signs in the state language and english.
national highway india|national highways have signs in the state language and english
road signs in iran mainly follow the vienna convention.
signs are in persian and english.
road signs in israel mainly follow the vienna convention, but have some variants.
road signs in japan are either controlled by local police authorities under road traffic law (道路交通法, dōro kōtsūhō) or by other road-controlling entities including ministry of land, infrastructure, transport and tourism, local municipalities, nexco (companies controlling expressways), under road law (道路法, dōrohō).
most of the design of the road signs in japan are similar to the signs on the vienna convention, except for some significant variances, such as stop sign with a red downward triangle.
the main signs are categorized into four meaning types:
road signs in macau are inherited from pre-1998 reform portuguese road signages.
they are written in chinese and portuguese.
road signs in the philippines are standardized in the road signs and pavement markings manual, published by the department of public works and highways.
philippine road signage practice closely follow those used in europe, but with local adaptations and some minor influences from the us mutcd and australian road signs.
however, some road signs may differ by locale, and mostly diverge from the national standard.
for example, the metropolitan manila development authority (mmda) has used pink and light blue in its signage for which it has been heavily criticised.
road signs in the philippines are classified as:
regulatory road signs – other than the stop and give way signs – are generally circular, with (for prohibitions) a black symbol on a white background within a red border, or (for mandatory instructions) a white symbol on a blue background.
in some cases circular regulatory signs are placed on white rectangular panels together with text supplementing their meanings.
most warning signs display a black symbol on a white background within a red-bordered equilateral triangle.
since 2012, however, a more visibly distinctive design (taken from that used for school signs in the us) has been adopted for pedestrian-related signs: these consist of a fluorescent yellow-green pentagon with black border and symbol.
additional panels may be placed below signs to supplement their meanings.
guide signs are divided into directional signs, service area signs, route markers, and tourist-related signs, with influence from both american and australian practice.
directional signs use a green background with white letters and arrows.
service area signs use a blue background with white letters, arrows, and symbols.
tourist-related signs use a brown background with white letters, arrows, and symbols.
the route marker sign, excluding the ah26 route marker, is based on the australian national route marker, but reserved for future use.
signs on expressways mostly take elements from australian motorway/freeway signs.
exit signs, wrong way signs and start/end of expressway signs are very similar to australian freeway signage.
traffic instruction signs are textual signs used to supplement warning and regulatory signs.
road signs in saudi arabia frequently show their text both in arabic and english.
road signs also indicate which part of the road is for muslims, and which part is for non-muslims, for instance near mecca.
singapore's traffic signs closely follow british road sign conventions, although the government has introduced some changes to them.
road signs in sri lanka are standardized road signs closely follow those used in europe with certain distinctions, and a number of changes have introduced road signs that suit as per local road and system.
sri lankan government announced by a gazette that aimed to get a face-lift and introduction of over 100 new road traffic signs.
the standardization of traffic signs in europe commenced with the signing of the 1931 geneva convention concerning the unification of road signals by several countries.
the 1931 convention rules were developed in the 1949 geneva protocol on road signs and signals.
in 1968, the european countries signed the vienna convention on road traffic treaty, with the aim of standardizing traffic regulations in participating countries in order to facilitate international road traffic and to increase road safety.
part of the treaty was the vienna convention on road signs and signals, which defined the traffic signs and signals.
as a result, in western europe the traffic signs are well standardized, although there are still some country-specific exceptions, mostly dating from the pre-1968 era.
the principle of the european traffic sign standard is that certain shapes and colours are to be used with consistent meanings:
directional signs ("guide signs" in american parlance) have not been harmonized under the convention, at least not on ordinary roads.
as a result, there are substantial differences in directional signage throughout europe.
differences apply to the choice of typeface, arrows and, most notably, colours.
the convention does, however, specify that the type of directional signage used should, for each country, distinguish limited-access roads ("motorways") from ordinary, all-purpose roads.
directional signage on motorways uses:
differences are greater for non-motorways:
the black-on-white signposting of secondary roads distinguishes them from primary roads in finland, france, portugal, the republic of ireland, switzerland, and the united kingdom.
in germany, hungary, italy, romania, and sweden black-on-white indicates urban-only roads or urban destinations.
the signposting of road numbers also differs greatly, except that european route numbers, if displayed, are always indicated using white characters on a green rectangle.
european route numbers are, however, not signed at all in the united kingdom.
the convention recommends that certain signs – such as "stop", "zone", etc.
– be in english; however, use of the local language is also permitted.
if a language uses non-latin characters, a latin-script transliteration of the names of cities and other important places should also be given.
road signs in the republic of ireland are bilingual, using irish and english.
wales similarly uses bilingual welsh–english signs, while some parts of scotland have bilingual scottish gaelic–english signs.
finland also uses bilingual signs, in finnish and swedish.
signs in belgium are in french, dutch, or german depending on the region.
in the brussels capital region, road signs are in both french and dutch.
signs in switzerland are in french, german, italian, or romansh depending on the canton.
european countries – with the notable exception of the united kingdom, where distances and lengths are indicated in miles, yards, feet, and inches, and speed limits are expressed in miles per hour – use the metric system on road signs.
for countries driving on the left, the convention stipulates that the traffic signs should be mirror images of those used in countries driving on the right.
this practice, however, is not systematically followed in the four european countries driving on the left, cyprus, malta, the republic of ireland, and the united kingdom.
the convention permits the use of two background colours for danger and prohibition signs: white or yellow.
most countries use white, with a few – such as finland, iceland, poland, and sweden – opting for yellow as this tends to improve the winter-time visibility of signs in areas where snow is prevalent.
in some countries, such as france or italy, white is the normal background colour for such signs, but yellow is used for temporary signage (as, for example, at road works).
european traffic signs have been designed with the principles of heraldry in mind;[citation needed] i.e., the sign must be clear and able to be resolved at a glance.
most traffic signs conform to heraldic tincture rules, and use symbols rather than written texts for better semiotic clarity.
croatian road signs follow the vienna convention (sfr yugoslavia was the original signatory for croatia, which is now a contracting party itself).
the most common signs are:
in the first years following croatia's independence, its traffic signs were the same as in the rest of the former yugoslavia.
in the early 2000s, replacement of the yellow background of warning signs began, and new signs now use a white background.
the signage typeface is snv, as with the other countries of the former yugoslavia.
road signs in iceland mainly follow the vienna convention, but use a variant of the colour scheme and minor design changes similar to the signs in sweden.
until the partition of ireland in 1922 and the independence of the irish free state (now the republic of ireland), british standards applied across the island.
in 1926 road sign standards similar to those used in the uk at the time were adopted.
law requires that the signs be written in both irish and english.
in 1956, road signs in the republic were changed from the uk standard with the adoption of us-style "diamond" signs for many road hazard warnings (junctions, bends, railway crossings, traffic lights).
some domestic signs were also invented, such as the keep-left sign (a black curved arrow pointing to the upper-left, although some are similar to the european "white arrow on blue disk" signs), while some other signs are not widely adopted outside ireland, such as the no-entry sign (a black arrow pointing ahead in a white circle with a red slashed circumference).
directional signage is similar to current united kingdom standards.
the same colours are used for directional signs in ireland as in the uk, and the uk transport and motorway fonts are used.
unlike wales and scotland, where welsh and gaelic place-names use the upright transport face, irish place-names are rendered in an italic face.
in january 2005 ireland adopted metric speed limits.
around 35,000 existing signs were replaced and a further 23,000 new signs erected bearing the speed limit in kilometres per hour.
to avoid confusion with the old signs, each speed limit sign now has "km/h" beneath the numerals.
also, since the adoption of signs based on the warboys committee standard in 1977, irish directional signs have used the metric system; however, unlike with the later speed limit changeover, there was no effort made to change the existing signage, and as of 2007[update] many finger posts still remain on rural roads with distances in miles, although the numbers continue to decline as roads are improved.
in late 2007 ireland began an extensive programme of sign and post replacement.
good examples are the m1 (dublin–dundalk) and the m50 (dublin).
while being mostly the same as the old signs, it is welcome as a lot of the signs were damaged/stained.
about half of the new posts are now two medium posts with crosshatched metal posts in-between instead of one large pole to minimise the damage in case of a crash.
road signs in latvia largely adhere to vienna convention guidelines.
in detailed design they closely resemble the signs used in germany.
road signs in the netherlands follow the vienna convention.
directional signs (which have not been harmonized under the convention) always use blue as the background colour.
the destinations on the sign are printed in white.
if the destination is not a town (but an area within town or some other kind of attraction), that destination will be printed in black on a separate white background within the otherwise blue sign.
the netherlands always signposts european road numbers where applicable (i.e., on the advance directional signs, the interchange direction signs and on the reassurance signs).
dutch national road numbers are placed on a rectangle, with motorways being signposted in white on a red rectangle (as an axx) and primary roads in black on a yellow rectangle (as nxx).
when a motorway changes to a primary road, its number remains the same, but the a is replaced by the n. so at a certain point the a2 becomes n2, and when it changes to a motorway again, it becomes a2 again.
signs intended for bike-riders always go on white signs with red or green letters.
the dutch typeface, known as anwb-ee, is based on the us typeface.
a new font, named anwb-uu (also known as redesign), has been developed in 1997 and appears on many recent dutch signs.
on the motorways however the typeface remains the anwb-ee or a similar typeface.
the language of the signs is typically dutch, even though bilingual signs may be used, when the information is relevant for tourists.
signs in norway mostly follow the vienna convention, except the polar bear warning sign, which is a white bear on a black background and a red border.
these are the directional signs:
the signs for road numbering are rectangular, and have this colour scheme:
the road signs in sweden mostly follow the vienna convention with a few adaptations, however, allowed within the convention:
the signage typeface tratex is used exclusively in sweden and is available as freeware.
even though switzerland is not a member of the eu, the road signs mostly follow the vienna convention with a few adaptations and exceptions.
road signs are categorized as follows:
distances and other measurements are displayed in metric units.
starting 2003, astra-frutiger is the typeface used to replace snv, which is still used in several european countries.
major exceptions from the norm are:
traffic signing in the uk conforms broadly to european norms, though a number of signs are unique to britain and direction signs omit european route numbers.
the current sign system, introduced on 1 january 1965, was developed in the late 1950s and early 1960s by the anderson committee, which established the motorway signing system, and by the worboys committee, which reformed signing for existing all-purpose roads.
(for illustrations of most british road signs, see 'know your traffic signs' on the gov.uk website.)
the uk remains the only european union member nation and the only commonwealth country to use non-metric (imperial) measurements for distance and speed, although "authorised weight" signs have been in metric tonnes since 1981 and there is currently a dual-unit (metric first) option for height and width restriction signage, intended for use on safety grounds.
on motorways kilometre signs are visible at intervals of 500 metres (1,600 ft) indicating the distance from the start of the motorway.
(see driver location sign).
three colour schemes exist for direction signs:
two typefaces are specified for british road signs.
transport "medium" or transport "heavy" are used for all text on fixed permanent signs and most temporary signage, depending on the colour of the sign and associated text colour; dark text on a white background is normally set in "heavy" so that it stands out better.
however route numbers on motorway signs use a taller limited character set typeface called "motorway".
signs are generally bilingual in all parts of wales (english/welsh or welsh/english), and similar signs are beginning to be seen in parts of the scottish highlands (english/scottish gaelic).
all signs and their associated regulations can be found in the traffic signs regulations and general directions, as updated by the tsrgd 2008, tsrgd 2011 and tsrgd 2016 and complemented by the various chapters of the "traffic signs manual".
the northern american, australian, and new zealand colors normally have these meanings:
the us manual on uniform traffic control devices prescribes four other colors:
regulatory signs are also sometimes seen with white letters on red or black signs.
in quebec, blue is often used for public services such as rest areas; many black-on-yellow signs are red-on-white instead.
many us states and canadian provinces now use fluorescent orange for construction signs.
every state and province has different markers for its own highways, but use standard ones for all federal highways.
many special highways – such as the queen elizabeth way, trans-canada highway, and various auto trails in the u.s. – have used unique signs.
counties in the us sometimes use a pentagonal blue sign with yellow letters for numbered county roads, though the use is inconsistent even within states.
distances on traffic signs generally follow the measurement system in use locally: that is to say, the metric system in all countries of the world except burma, liberia, the united kingdom, and the united states – although the metric system is used in the uk for all purposes other than the display of road distances and the defining of speed limits, and in the us the federal department of transportation has developed (very rarely used) metric standards for all signs.
where signs use a language, the recognized language/s of the area is normally used.
signs in most of the us, canada, australia, and new zealand are in english.
quebec uses french, while new brunswick and the jacques-cartier and champlain bridges, in montreal (as well as some parts in the west island), use both english and french, and a number of other provinces and states, such as ontario, manitoba, and vermont use bilingual french–english signs in certain localities.
puerto rico (a us territory) and mexico use spanish.
within a few miles of the us–mexico border, road signs are often in english and spanish in places like san diego, yuma, and el paso.
indigenous languages, mainly nahuatl as well as some mayan languages, have been used as well.
the typefaces predominantly used on signs in the us and canada are the fhwa alphabet series (series b through series f and series e modified).
details of letter shape and spacing for these alphabet series are given in "standard alphabets for traffic control devices", first published by the bureau of public roads (bpr) in 1945 and subsequently updated by the federal highway administration (fhwa).
it is now part of standard highway signs (shs), the companion volume to the mutcd which gives full design details for signfaces.
initially, all of the alphabet series consisted of uppercase letters and digits only, although lowercase extensions were provided for each alphabet series in a 2002 revision of shs.
series b through series f evolved from identically named alphabet series which were introduced in 1927.
straight-stroke letters in the 1927 series were substantially similar to their modern equivalents, but unrounded glyphs were used for letters such as b, c, d, etc., to permit more uniform fabrication of signs by illiterate painters.
various state highway departments and the federal bpr experimented with rounded versions of these letters in the following two decades.
the modern, rounded alphabet series were finally standardized in 1945 after rounded versions of some letters (with widths loosely appropriate for series c or d) were specified as an option in the 1935 mutcd and draft versions of the new typefaces had been used in 1942 for guide signs on the newly constructed pentagon road network.
the mixed-case alphabet now called series e modified, which is the standard for destination legend on freeway guide signs, originally existed in two parts: an all-uppercase series e modified, which was essentially similar to series e, except for a larger stroke width, and a lowercase-only alphabet.
both parts were developed by the california division of highways (now caltrans) for use on freeways in 1948–1950.
initially, the division used all-uppercase series e modified for button-reflectorized letters on ground-mounted signs and mixed-case legend (lowercase letters with series d capitals) for externally illuminated overhead guide signs.
several eastern turnpike authorities blended all-uppercase series e modified with the lowercase alphabet for destination legends on their guide signs.
eventually, this combination was accepted for destination legend in the first manual for signing interstate highways, which was published in 1958 by the american association of state highway officials and adopted as the national standard by the bpr.
the us national park service uses nps rawlinson roadway, a serif typeface, for guide signage; it typically appears on a brown background.
rawlinson has replaced clarendon as the official nps typeface, but some states still use clarendon for recreational signage.
georgia, in the past, used uppercase series d with a custom lowercase alphabet on its freeway guide signs; the most distinctive feature of this typeface is the lack of a dot on lowercase i and j. more recent installations appear to include the dots.
the clearview typeface, developed by us researchers to provide improved legibility, is permitted for light legend on dark backgrounds under fhwa interim approval.
clearview has seen widespread use by state departments of transportation in arkansas, arizona, illinois, kentucky, maryland, michigan, ohio, pennsylvania, texas, and virginia.
the kansas turnpike authority has also introduced clearview typeface to some of its newer guide signs along the kansas turnpike, but the state of kansas continues to use the fhwa typefaces for signage on its non-tolled interstates and freeways.
in canada, the ministry of transportation for the province of british columbia specifies clearview for use on its highway guide signs, and its usage has shown up in ontario on the don valley parkway and gardiner expressway in toronto and on new 400-series highway installations in hamilton, halton and niagara, as well as street signs in various parts of the province.
the font is also being used on newer signs in alberta, manitoba, and quebec.
it is common for local governments, airport authorities, and contractors to fabricate traffic signs using typefaces other than the fhwa series; helvetica, futura and arial are common choices.
new zealand road signs are generally influenced both by american and european practices.
warning signs are diamond-shaped with a yellow background for permanent warnings, and an orange background for temporary warnings.
they are somewhat more pictorial than their american counterparts.
this is also true for canadian signage.
regulatory signs also follow european practice, with a white circle with a red border indicating prohibitive actions, and a blue circle indicating mandatory actions.
white rectangular signs with a red border indicate lane usage directions.
information and direction signs are rectangular, with a green background indicating a state highway, a blue background for all other roads and all services (except in some, where directional signage is white), and a brown background for tourist attractions.
before 1987, most road signs had black backgrounds – diamonds indicated warnings, and rectangles indicated regulatory actions (with the exception of the give way sign (an inverted trapezium), and stop sign and speed limit signs (which were the same as today)).
information signs were yellow, and direction signage was green on motorways and black everywhere else.
road signs in caribbean, central america, and south america vary from country to country.
for the most part, conventions in signage tend to resemble united states signage conventions more so than european and asian conventions.
for example, warning signs are typically diamond-shaped and yellow rather than triangular and white.
some variations include the "parking" and "no parking" signs, which contain either a letter e or p, depending on which word is used locally for "parking" (spanish estacionamiento or parqueo, portuguese estacionamento), as well as the stop sign, which usually reads "pare" or "alto".
notable exceptions include speed limit signs, which follow the european conventions, and the "no entry" sign, often replaced with a crossed upwards arrow.
traffic signs in colombia are classified into three categories:
warning signs are very similar to warning signs in united states.
they are yellow diamond-shaped with a black symbol (the yellow colour is changed to an orange colour in areas under construction).
in certain cases, the yellow colour is shifted to fluorescent yellow (in the school area sign and chevron sign).
mandatory signs are similar to european signs.
they are circular with a red border, a white background and a black symbol.
stop sign and yield sign are as european, except the word "stop" is changed for "pare" and the yield sign has no letters, it is a red triangle with white centre.
information signs have many shapes and colours.
principally they are blue with white symbols and in many cases these signs have an information letter below the symbol.
road signs in haiti are standardized road signs closely follow those used in france with certain distinctions.
they are written in french and haitian creole.
road signs in suriname are particularly modelled on the dutch road signs since suriname is a former dutch colony, although traffic drives on the left.
cars are beginning to feature cameras with automatic traffic sign recognition, beginning with the opel insignia.
it mainly recognizes speed limits and no-overtaking areas.

this is a list of confederate monuments and memorials that were established as public displays and symbols of the confederate states of america (csa), confederate leaders, or confederate soldiers of the american civil war.
part of the commemoration of the american civil war, these symbols include monuments and statues, flags, holidays and other observances, and the names of schools, roads, parks, bridges, counties, cities, lakes, dams, military bases, and other public works.
in a december 2018 special report, smithsonian magazine stated, "over the past ten years, taxpayers have directed at least $40 million to confederate monuments—statues, homes, parks, museums, libraries and cemeteries—and to confederate heritage organizations."
monuments and memorials are listed below alphabetically by state, and by city within each state.
states not listed have no known qualifying items for the list.
for monuments and memorials which have been removed, consult removal of confederate monuments and memorials.
this list does not include the removal of figures connected with the origins of the civil war or white supremacy, but not with the confederacy, including statues of supreme court justice roger b. taney in annapolis, baltimore, and frederick, maryland, a controversial portrait of north carolina chief justice thomas ruffin, and numerous memorials to southern politician john c. calhoun (commemorated on the confederacy's 1¢ stamp), although monuments to calhoun "have been the most consistent targets" of vandals.
it also does not include post-civil war white supremacists, such as north carolina governor charles aycock and mississippi governor james k. vardaman, some of whose monuments are also being removed (see charles brantley aycock#legacy) and james k. vardaman#personal life, death and legacy).
memorials have been erected on public spaces (including on courthouse grounds) either at public expense or funded by private organizations and donors.
numerous private memorials have also been erected.
according to smithsonian magazine, "confederate monuments aren't just heirlooms, the artifacts of a bygone era.
instead, american taxpayers are still heavily investing in these tributes today."
the report also concluded that the monuments were constructed and are regularly maintained in promotion of lost cause, white supremacist mythology, and over the many decades of their establishment, african american leaders regularly protested these memorials and what they represented.
a small number of memorializations were made during the war, mainly as ship and place names.
after the war, robert e. lee said on several occasions that he was opposed to any monuments, as they would, in his opinion, "keep open the sores of war".
nevertheless, monuments and memorials continued to be dedicated shortly after the american civil war.
[better source needed] many more monuments were dedicated in the years after 1890, when congress established the first national military park at chickamauga and chattanooga, and by the turn of the twentieth century, five battlefields from the civil war had been preserved: chickamauga-chattanooga,antietam, gettysburg, shiloh, and vicksburg.
at vicksburg national military park, more than 95 percent of the park's monuments were erected in the first eighteen years after the park was established in 1899.
confederate monument-building has often been part of widespread campaigns to promote and justify jim crow laws in the south, and assert white supremacy.
according to the american historical association (aha), the erection of confederate monuments during the early twentieth century was "part and parcel of the initiation of legally mandated segregation and widespread disenfranchisement across the south."
according to the aha, memorials to the confederacy erected during this period "were intended, in part, to obscure the terrorism required to overthrow reconstruction, and to intimidate african americans politically and isolate them from the mainstream of public life."
a later wave of monument building coincided with the civil rights movement, and according to the aha "these symbols of white supremacy are still being invoked for similar purposes."
according to smithsonian magazine, "far from simply being markers of historic events and people, as proponents argue, these memorials were created and funded by jim crow governments to pay homage to a slave-owning society and to serve as blunt assertions of dominance over african-americans.
"this is a modern interpretation of the motive for monuments.
honoring ancestors is an ancient tradition and is still present in our society.
according to historian jane dailey from the university of chicago, in many cases, the purpose of the monuments was not to celebrate the past but rather to promote a "white supremacist future".
another historian, karen l. cox, from the university of north carolina at charlotte, has written that the monuments are "a legacy of the brutally racist jim crow era", and that "the whole point of confederate monuments is to celebrate white supremacy".
another historian from unc, james leloudis, stated that "the funders and backers of these monuments are very explicit that they are requiring a political education and a legitimacy for the jim crow era and the right of white men to rule."
they were erected without the consent or even input of southern african americans, who remembered the civil war far differently, and who had no interest in honoring those who fought to keep them enslaved.
according to civil war historian judith giesberg, professor of history at villanova university, "white supremacy is really what these participation trophy represent."
some monuments were also meant to beautify cities as part of the city beautiful movement, although this was secondary.
in a june 2018 speech, civil war historian james i. robertson jr. of virginia tech university said the monuments were not a "jim crow signal of defiance" and referred to the current trend to dismantle or destroy them as an "age of idiocy" motivated by "elements hell-bent on tearing apart unity that generations of americans have painfully constructed."
katrina dunn johnson, curator at south carolina's confederate relic room and military museum, states that "thousands of families throughout the country were unable to reclaim their soldier's remains--many never learned their loved ones' exact fate on the battlefield or within the prison camps.
the psychological impact of such a devastating loss cannot be underestimated when attempting to understand the primary motivations behind southern memorialization."
many confederate monuments were dedicated in the former confederate states and border states in the decades following the civil war, in many instances by ladies memorial associations, united daughters of the confederacy (udc), united confederate veterans (ucv), sons of confederate veterans (scv), the heritage preservation association, and other memorial organizations.
other confederate monuments are located on civil war battlefields.
many confederate monuments are listed on the national register of historic places, either separately or as contributing objects within listings of courthouses or historic districts.
art historians cynthia mills and pamela simpson argued, in monuments to the lost cause, that the majority of confederate monuments, of the type they define, were "commissioned by white women, in hope of preserving a positive vision of antebellum life."
in the late nineteenth century, technological innovations in the granite and bronze industries helped reduce costs and made monuments more affordable for small towns.
companies looking to capitalize on this opportunity often sold nearly identical copies of monuments to both the north and south.
another wave of monument construction coincided with the civil rights movement and the american civil war centennial.
at least thirty-two confederate monuments were dedicated between 2000 and 2017, including at least 7 re-dedications.
scholarly studies of the monuments began in the 1980s.
in 1983 john j. winberry published a study which was based on data from the work of r.w.
widener.
he estimated that the main building period for monuments was from 1889 to 1929 and that of the monuments erected in courthouse squares over half were built between 1902 and 1912. he determined four main locations for monuments; battlefields, cemeteries, county courthouse grounds, and state capitol grounds.
over a third of the courthouse monuments were dedicated to the dead.
the majority of the cemetery monuments in his study were built in the pre-1900 period, while most of the courthouse monuments were erected after 1900. of the 666 monuments in his study 55% were of confederate soldiers, while 28% were obelisks.
soldiers dominated courthouse grounds, while obelisks account for nearly half of cemetery monuments.
the idea that the soldier statues always faced north was found to be untrue and that the soldiers usually faced the same direction as the courthouse.
he noted that the monuments were "remarkably diverse" with "only a few instances of repetition of inscriptions".
he categorized the monuments into four types.
type 1 was a confederate soldier on a column with his weapon at parade rest, or weaponless and gazing into the distance.
these accounted for approximately half the monuments studied.
they are, however, the most popular among the courthouse monuments.
type 2 was a confederate soldier on a column with rifle ready, or carrying a flag or bugle.
type 3 was an obelisk, often covered with drapery and bearing cannon balls or an urn.
this type was 28% of the monuments studied, but 48% of the monuments in cemeteries and 18% of courthouse monuments.
type 4 was a miscellaneous group, including arches, standing stones, plaques, fountains, etc.
these account for 17% of the monuments studied.
over a third of the courthouse monuments were specifically dedicated to the confederate dead.
the first courthouse monument was erected in bolivar, tennessee, in 1867. by 1880 nine courthouse monuments had been erected.
winberry noted two centers of courthouse monuments: the potomac counties of virginia, from which the tradition spread to north carolina, and a larger area covering georgia, south carolina and northern florida.
the diffusion of courthouse monuments was aided by organizations such as the united confederate veterans and their publications, though other factors may also have been effective.
winberry listed four reasons for the shift from cemeteries to courthouses.
first was the need to preserve the memory of the confederate dead and also recognize the veterans who returned.
second was to celebrate the rebuilding of the south after the war.
third was the romanticizing of the lost cause, and the fourth was to unify the white population in a common heritage against the interests of african-american southerners.
he concluded: "no one of these four possible explanations for the confederate monument is adequate or complete in itself.
the monument is a symbol, but whether it was a memory of the past, a celebration of the present, or a portent of the future remains a difficult question to answer; monuments and symbols can be complicated and sometimes indecipherable."
as of june 19, over 12 confederate monuments had been vandalized in 2019, usually with paint.
as of april 2017, at least 60 symbols of the confederacy had been removed or renamed since 2015, according to the southern poverty law center (splc).
at the same time, laws in various southern states place restrictions on, or prohibit altogether, the removal of statutes and memorials and the renaming of parks, roads, and schools.
a 2017 reuters poll found that 54% of adults stated that the monuments should remain in all public spaces, and 27% said they should be removed, while 19% said they were unsure.
the results were split along racial and political lines, with republicans and whites preferring to keep the monuments in place, while democrats and minorities were more likely to support their removal.
a similar 2017 poll by huffpost/yougov found that one-third of respondents favored removal, while 49% were opposed.
confederate monuments are widely distributed across the southern united states.
the distribution pattern follows the general political boundaries of the confederacy.
of the more than 1503 public monuments and memorials to the confederacy, more than 718 are monuments and statues.
nearly 300 monuments and statues are in georgia, virginia, or north carolina.
according to one researcher, "the absence of monuments in eastern tennessee and western north carolina indicates those regions' union sentiment, and the few monuments in maryland, west virginia, and kentucky reflect those states' ambivalent war-time politics."
the northern states that remained part of the union, as well as the western states that were largely settled after the civil war, have few or no memorials to the confederacy.
there are 10 major u.s. military bases named in honor of confederate military leaders, all in former confederate states.
in 2015 the pentagon declared it would not be renaming these facilities, and declined to make further comment in 2017.
several ships named for confederate leaders fell into union hands during the civil war.
the union navy retained the names of these ships while turning their guns against the confederacy:

county governments at the time voted to accept the gifts and take ownership of the statues.
site of confederate park // local businessman khleber m. van zandt organized the robert e. lee camp of the united confederate veterans in 1889. by 1900 it boasted more than 700 members.
the club received a 25-year charter to create the confederate park association in 1901, then purchased 373 acres (151 ha) near this site for the "recreation, refuge and relief of confederate soldiers" and their families.
opening events included a picnic for veterans and families on june 20, 1902, and a statewide reunion september 8–12, 1902, with 3,500 attendees.
the park thrived as a center for the civil and social activities on texas confederate organizations.
by 1924 the numbers [ sic ] of surviving veterans had greatly diminished, and the confederate park association dissolved when its charter expired in 1926.
note: "there are similarly named streets in towns and cities across east texas, notably port arthur and beaumont, as well as memorials to dowling and the davis guards, not least at sabine pass, where the battleground is now preserved as a state park"

the confederate mothers monument, also known as simply confederate memorial, confederate monument, or texarkana confederate memorial, is an outdoor confederate memorial installed at 500 state line road in texarkana.
it stands alone in a triangle bounded by roads on the west side of state line avenue, just inside the u.s. state of texas.
and faces the court house and post office, a building unusual for sitting in and serving two states.
the monument was dedicated on april 21, 1918. it was designed by henry allen and constructed by allen monuments.
the two figures were obtained from italy.
thought to be the only confederate monument to include a woman in texas, it is carved from marble.
the monument's inscription for the confederate mother statue reads: "o great confederate mothers, we would print your names on monuments, that men may read them as the years go by and tribute pay to you, who bore and nurtured hero sons and gave them solace on that darkest hour, when they came home with broken swords and guns".
the inscription for the confederate soldier reads, "to our loyal confederates".
the soldier faces north.
the chapter of the united daughters of the confederacy that built the confederate mothers monument was disbanded and a new chapter does not own the monument so the city is responsible for maintenance.
this is a list of confederate monuments and memorials that were established as public displays and symbols of the confederate states of america (csa), confederate leaders, or confederate soldiers of the american civil war.
part of the commemoration of the american civil war, these symbols include monuments and statues, flags, holidays and other observances, and the names of schools, roads, parks, bridges, counties, cities, lakes, dams, military bases, and other public works.
in a december 2018 special report, smithsonian magazine stated, "over the past ten years, taxpayers have directed at least $40 million to confederate monuments—statues, homes, parks, museums, libraries and cemeteries—and to confederate heritage organizations."
monuments and memorials are listed below alphabetically by state, and by city within each state.
states not listed have no known qualifying items for the list.
for monuments and memorials which have been removed, consult removal of confederate monuments and memorials.
this list does not include the removal of figures connected with the origins of the civil war or white supremacy, but not with the confederacy, including statues of supreme court justice roger b. taney in annapolis, baltimore, and frederick, maryland, a controversial portrait of north carolina chief justice thomas ruffin, and numerous memorials to southern politician john c. calhoun (commemorated on the confederacy's 1¢ stamp), although monuments to calhoun "have been the most consistent targets" of vandals.
it also does not include post-civil war white supremacists, such as north carolina governor charles aycock and mississippi governor james k. vardaman, some of whose monuments are also being removed (see charles brantley aycock#legacy) and james k. vardaman#personal life, death and legacy).
memorials have been erected on public spaces (including on courthouse grounds) either at public expense or funded by private organizations and donors.
numerous private memorials have also been erected.
according to smithsonian magazine, "confederate monuments aren't just heirlooms, the artifacts of a bygone era.
instead, american taxpayers are still heavily investing in these tributes today."
the report also concluded that the monuments were constructed and are regularly maintained in promotion of lost cause, white supremacist mythology, and over the many decades of their establishment, african american leaders regularly protested these memorials and what they represented.
a small number of memorializations were made during the war, mainly as ship and place names.
after the war, robert e. lee said on several occasions that he was opposed to any monuments, as they would, in his opinion, "keep open the sores of war".
nevertheless, monuments and memorials continued to be dedicated shortly after the american civil war.
[better source needed] many more monuments were dedicated in the years after 1890, when congress established the first national military park at chickamauga and chattanooga, and by the turn of the twentieth century, five battlefields from the civil war had been preserved: chickamauga-chattanooga,antietam, gettysburg, shiloh, and vicksburg.
at vicksburg national military park, more than 95 percent of the park's monuments were erected in the first eighteen years after the park was established in 1899.
confederate monument-building has often been part of widespread campaigns to promote and justify jim crow laws in the south, and assert white supremacy.
according to the american historical association (aha), the erection of confederate monuments during the early twentieth century was "part and parcel of the initiation of legally mandated segregation and widespread disenfranchisement across the south."
according to the aha, memorials to the confederacy erected during this period "were intended, in part, to obscure the terrorism required to overthrow reconstruction, and to intimidate african americans politically and isolate them from the mainstream of public life."
a later wave of monument building coincided with the civil rights movement, and according to the aha "these symbols of white supremacy are still being invoked for similar purposes."
according to smithsonian magazine, "far from simply being markers of historic events and people, as proponents argue, these memorials were created and funded by jim crow governments to pay homage to a slave-owning society and to serve as blunt assertions of dominance over african-americans.
"this is a modern interpretation of the motive for monuments.
honoring ancestors is an ancient tradition and is still present in our society.

the lion of belfort (french: le lion de belfort) is a monument at dorchester square in downtown montreal.
the lion of belfort is a reclining british imperial lion, facing east towards france and the united kingdom.
the lion appears reposed, calm and alert—indicating that the city is safe.
the lion was sculpted by george william hill.
as noted on the monument's base, hill was inspired by the lion of belfort, a monumental statue by frédéric bartholdi in belfort, france.
the statue's granite base was designed by scottish-born montreal architect robert findlay.
inaugurated on may 24, 1897, the lion is placed at the eastern side along metcalfe and formed the eastern point in the cross.
it was initially part of a fountain established for queen victoria's diamond jubilee by the sun life assurance company prior to the development of the sun life building.

[better source needed] many more monuments were dedicated in the years after 1890, when congress established the first national military park at chickamauga and chattanooga, and by the turn of the twentieth century, five battlefields from the civil war had been preserved: chickamauga-chattanooga,antietam, gettysburg, shiloh, and vicksburg.
at vicksburg national military park, more than 95 percent of the park's monuments were erected in the first eighteen years after the park was established in 1899.
confederate monument-building has often been part of widespread campaigns to promote and justify jim crow laws in the south, and assert white supremacy.
according to the american historical association (aha), the erection of confederate monuments during the early twentieth century was "part and parcel of the initiation of legally mandated segregation and widespread disenfranchisement across the south."
according to the aha, memorials to the confederacy erected during this period "were intended, in part, to obscure the terrorism required to overthrow reconstruction, and to intimidate african americans politically and isolate them from the mainstream of public life."
a later wave of monument building coincided with the civil rights movement, and according to the aha "these symbols of white supremacy are still being invoked for similar purposes."
according to smithsonian magazine, "far from simply being markers of historic events and people, as proponents argue, these memorials were created and funded by jim crow governments to pay homage to a slave-owning society and to serve as blunt assertions of dominance over african-americans.
"this is a modern interpretation of the motive for monuments.
honoring ancestors is an ancient tradition and is still present in our society.
according to historian jane dailey from the university of chicago, in many cases, the purpose of the monuments was not to celebrate the past but rather to promote a "white supremacist future".
another historian, karen l. cox, from the university of north carolina at charlotte, has written that the monuments are "a legacy of the brutally racist jim crow era", and that "the whole point of confederate monuments is to celebrate white supremacy".
another historian from unc, james leloudis, stated that "the funders and backers of these monuments are very explicit that they are requiring a political education and a legitimacy for the jim crow era and the right of white men to rule."
they were erected without the consent or even input of southern african americans, who remembered the civil war far differently, and who had no interest in honoring those who fought to keep them enslaved.
according to civil war historian judith giesberg, professor of history at villanova university, "white supremacy is really what these participation trophy represent."
some monuments were also meant to beautify cities as part of the city beautiful movement, although this was secondary.
in a june 2018 speech, civil war historian james i. robertson jr. of virginia tech university said the monuments were not a "jim crow signal of defiance" and referred to the current trend to dismantle or destroy them as an "age of idiocy" motivated by "elements hell-bent on tearing apart unity that generations of americans have painfully constructed."
katrina dunn johnson, curator at south carolina's confederate relic room and military museum, states that "thousands of families throughout the country were unable to reclaim their soldier's remains--many never learned their loved ones' exact fate on the battlefield or within the prison camps.
the psychological impact of such a devastating loss cannot be underestimated when attempting to understand the primary motivations behind southern memorialization."
many confederate monuments were dedicated in the former confederate states and border states in the decades following the civil war, in many instances by ladies memorial associations, united daughters of the confederacy (udc), united confederate veterans (ucv), sons of confederate veterans (scv), the heritage preservation association, and other memorial organizations.
other confederate monuments are located on civil war battlefields.
many confederate monuments are listed on the national register of historic places, either separately or as contributing objects within listings of courthouses or historic districts.
art historians cynthia mills and pamela simpson argued, in monuments to the lost cause, that the majority of confederate monuments, of the type they define, were "commissioned by white women, in hope of preserving a positive vision of antebellum life."
in the late nineteenth century, technological innovations in the granite and bronze industries helped reduce costs and made monuments more affordable for small towns.
companies looking to capitalize on this opportunity often sold nearly identical copies of monuments to both the north and south.
another wave of monument construction coincided with the civil rights movement and the american civil war centennial.
at least thirty-two confederate monuments were dedicated between 2000 and 2017, including at least 7 re-dedications.
scholarly studies of the monuments began in the 1980s.
in 1983 john j. winberry published a study which was based on data from the work of r.w.
widener.
he estimated that the main building period for monuments was from 1889 to 1929 and that of the monuments erected in courthouse squares over half were built between 1902 and 1912. he determined four main locations for monuments; battlefields, cemeteries, county courthouse grounds, and state capitol grounds.
over a third of the courthouse monuments were dedicated to the dead.
the majority of the cemetery monuments in his study were built in the pre-1900 period, while most of the courthouse monuments were erected after 1900. of the 666 monuments in his study 55% were of confederate soldiers, while 28% were obelisks.
soldiers dominated courthouse grounds, while obelisks account for nearly half of cemetery monuments.
the idea that the soldier statues always faced north was found to be untrue and that the soldiers usually faced the same direction as the courthouse.
he noted that the monuments were "remarkably diverse" with "only a few instances of repetition of inscriptions".
he categorized the monuments into four types.
type 1 was a confederate soldier on a column with his weapon at parade rest, or weaponless and gazing into the distance.
these accounted for approximately half the monuments studied.
they are, however, the most popular among the courthouse monuments.
type 2 was a confederate soldier on a column with rifle ready, or carrying a flag or bugle.
type 3 was an obelisk, often covered with drapery and bearing cannon balls or an urn.
this type was 28% of the monuments studied, but 48% of the monuments in cemeteries and 18% of courthouse monuments.
type 4 was a miscellaneous group, including arches, standing stones, plaques, fountains, etc.
these account for 17% of the monuments studied.
over a third of the courthouse monuments were specifically dedicated to the confederate dead.
the first courthouse monument was erected in bolivar, tennessee, in 1867. by 1880 nine courthouse monuments had been erected.
winberry noted two centers of courthouse monuments: the potomac counties of virginia, from which the tradition spread to north carolina, and a larger area covering georgia, south carolina and northern florida.
the diffusion of courthouse monuments was aided by organizations such as the united confederate veterans and their publications, though other factors may also have been effective.
winberry listed four reasons for the shift from cemeteries to courthouses.
first was the need to preserve the memory of the confederate dead and also recognize the veterans who returned.
second was to celebrate the rebuilding of the south after the war.
third was the romanticizing of the lost cause, and the fourth was to unify the white population in a common heritage against the interests of african-american southerners.
he concluded: "no one of these four possible explanations for the confederate monument is adequate or complete in itself.
the monument is a symbol, but whether it was a memory of the past, a celebration of the present, or a portent of the future remains a difficult question to answer; monuments and symbols can be complicated and sometimes indecipherable."
as of june 19, over 12 confederate monuments had been vandalized in 2019, usually with paint.
as of april 2017, at least 60 symbols of the confederacy had been removed or renamed since 2015, according to the southern poverty law center (splc).
at the same time, laws in various southern states place restrictions on, or prohibit altogether, the removal of statutes and memorials and the renaming of parks, roads, and schools.
a 2017 reuters poll found that 54% of adults stated that the monuments should remain in all public spaces, and 27% said they should be removed, while 19% said they were unsure.
the results were split along racial and political lines, with republicans and whites preferring to keep the monuments in place, while democrats and minorities were more likely to support their removal.
a similar 2017 poll by huffpost/yougov found that one-third of respondents favored removal, while 49% were opposed.
confederate monuments are widely distributed across the southern united states.
the distribution pattern follows the general political boundaries of the confederacy.
of the more than 1503 public monuments and memorials to the confederacy, more than 718 are monuments and statues.
nearly 300 monuments and statues are in georgia, virginia, or north carolina.
according to one researcher, "the absence of monuments in eastern tennessee and western north carolina indicates those regions' union sentiment, and the few monuments in maryland, west virginia, and kentucky reflect those states' ambivalent war-time politics."
the northern states that remained part of the union, as well as the western states that were largely settled after the civil war, have few or no memorials to the confederacy.
there are 10 major u.s. military bases named in honor of confederate military leaders, all in former confederate states.
in 2015 the pentagon declared it would not be renaming these facilities, and declined to make further comment in 2017.
several ships named for confederate leaders fell into union hands during the civil war.
the union navy retained the names of these ships while turning their guns against the confederacy:

site of confederate park // local businessman khleber m. van zandt organized the robert e. lee camp of the united confederate veterans in 1889. by 1900 it boasted more than 700 members.
the club received a 25-year charter to create the confederate park association in 1901, then purchased 373 acres (151 ha) near this site for the "recreation, refuge and relief of confederate soldiers" and their families.
opening events included a picnic for veterans and families on june 20, 1902, and a statewide reunion september 8–12, 1902, with 3,500 attendees.
the park thrived as a center for the civil and social activities on texas confederate organizations.
by 1924 the numbers [ sic ] of surviving veterans had greatly diminished, and the confederate park association dissolved when its charter expired in 1926.

this is a list of confederate monuments and memorials that were established as public displays and symbols of the confederate states of america (csa), confederate leaders, or confederate soldiers of the american civil war.
part of the commemoration of the american civil war, these symbols include monuments and statues, flags, holidays and other observances, and the names of schools, roads, parks, bridges, counties, cities, lakes, dams, military bases, and other public works.
in a december 2018 special report, smithsonian magazine stated, "over the past ten years, taxpayers have directed at least $40 million to confederate monuments—statues, homes, parks, museums, libraries and cemeteries—and to confederate heritage organizations."
monuments and memorials are listed below alphabetically by state, and by city within each state.
states not listed have no known qualifying items for the list.
for monuments and memorials which have been removed, consult removal of confederate monuments and memorials.
this list does not include the removal of figures connected with the origins of the civil war or white supremacy, but not with the confederacy, including statues of supreme court justice roger b. taney in annapolis, baltimore, and frederick, maryland, a controversial portrait of north carolina chief justice thomas ruffin, and numerous memorials to southern politician john c. calhoun (commemorated on the confederacy's 1¢ stamp), although monuments to calhoun "have been the most consistent targets" of vandals.
it also does not include post-civil war white supremacists, such as north carolina governor charles aycock and mississippi governor james k. vardaman, some of whose monuments are also being removed (see charles brantley aycock#legacy) and james k. vardaman#personal life, death and legacy).
memorials have been erected on public spaces (including on courthouse grounds) either at public expense or funded by private organizations and donors.
numerous private memorials have also been erected.
according to smithsonian magazine, "confederate monuments aren't just heirlooms, the artifacts of a bygone era.
instead, american taxpayers are still heavily investing in these tributes today."
the report also concluded that the monuments were constructed and are regularly maintained in promotion of lost cause, white supremacist mythology, and over the many decades of their establishment, african american leaders regularly protested these memorials and what they represented.
a small number of memorializations were made during the war, mainly as ship and place names.
after the war, robert e. lee said on several occasions that he was opposed to any monuments, as they would, in his opinion, "keep open the sores of war".

according to the american historical association (aha), the erection of confederate monuments during the early twentieth century was "part and parcel of the initiation of legally mandated segregation and widespread disenfranchisement across the south."
according to the aha, memorials to the confederacy erected during this period "were intended, in part, to obscure the terrorism required to overthrow reconstruction, and to intimidate african americans politically and isolate them from the mainstream of public life."
a later wave of monument building coincided with the civil rights movement, and according to the aha "these symbols of white supremacy are still being invoked for similar purposes."
according to smithsonian magazine, "far from simply being markers of historic events and people, as proponents argue, these memorials were created and funded by jim crow governments to pay homage to a slave-owning society and to serve as blunt assertions of dominance over african-americans.
"this is a modern interpretation of the motive for monuments.
honoring ancestors is an ancient tradition and is still present in our society.
according to historian jane dailey from the university of chicago, in many cases, the purpose of the monuments was not to celebrate the past but rather to promote a "white supremacist future".
another historian, karen l. cox, from the university of north carolina at charlotte, has written that the monuments are "a legacy of the brutally racist jim crow era", and that "the whole point of confederate monuments is to celebrate white supremacy".
another historian from unc, james leloudis, stated that "the funders and backers of these monuments are very explicit that they are requiring a political education and a legitimacy for the jim crow era and the right of white men to rule."
they were erected without the consent or even input of southern african americans, who remembered the civil war far differently, and who had no interest in honoring those who fought to keep them enslaved.
according to civil war historian judith giesberg, professor of history at villanova university, "white supremacy is really what these participation trophy represent."
some monuments were also meant to beautify cities as part of the city beautiful movement, although this was secondary.
in a june 2018 speech, civil war historian james i. robertson jr. of virginia tech university said the monuments were not a "jim crow signal of defiance" and referred to the current trend to dismantle or destroy them as an "age of idiocy" motivated by "elements hell-bent on tearing apart unity that generations of americans have painfully constructed."
katrina dunn johnson, curator at south carolina's confederate relic room and military museum, states that "thousands of families throughout the country were unable to reclaim their soldier's remains--many never learned their loved ones' exact fate on the battlefield or within the prison camps.
the psychological impact of such a devastating loss cannot be underestimated when attempting to understand the primary motivations behind southern memorialization."
many confederate monuments were dedicated in the former confederate states and border states in the decades following the civil war, in many instances by ladies memorial associations, united daughters of the confederacy (udc), united confederate veterans (ucv), sons of confederate veterans (scv), the heritage preservation association, and other memorial organizations.
other confederate monuments are located on civil war battlefields.
many confederate monuments are listed on the national register of historic places, either separately or as contributing objects within listings of courthouses or historic districts.
art historians cynthia mills and pamela simpson argued, in monuments to the lost cause, that the majority of confederate monuments, of the type they define, were "commissioned by white women, in hope of preserving a positive vision of antebellum life."
in the late nineteenth century, technological innovations in the granite and bronze industries helped reduce costs and made monuments more affordable for small towns.
companies looking to capitalize on this opportunity often sold nearly identical copies of monuments to both the north and south.
another wave of monument construction coincided with the civil rights movement and the american civil war centennial.
at least thirty-two confederate monuments were dedicated between 2000 and 2017, including at least 7 re-dedications.
scholarly studies of the monuments began in the 1980s.
in 1983 john j. winberry published a study which was based on data from the work of r.w.
widener.
he estimated that the main building period for monuments was from 1889 to 1929 and that of the monuments erected in courthouse squares over half were built between 1902 and 1912. he determined four main locations for monuments; battlefields, cemeteries, county courthouse grounds, and state capitol grounds.
over a third of the courthouse monuments were dedicated to the dead.
the majority of the cemetery monuments in his study were built in the pre-1900 period, while most of the courthouse monuments were erected after 1900. of the 666 monuments in his study 55% were of confederate soldiers, while 28% were obelisks.
soldiers dominated courthouse grounds, while obelisks account for nearly half of cemetery monuments.
the idea that the soldier statues always faced north was found to be untrue and that the soldiers usually faced the same direction as the courthouse.
he noted that the monuments were "remarkably diverse" with "only a few instances of repetition of inscriptions".
he categorized the monuments into four types.
type 1 was a confederate soldier on a column with his weapon at parade rest, or weaponless and gazing into the distance.
these accounted for approximately half the monuments studied.
they are, however, the most popular among the courthouse monuments.
type 2 was a confederate soldier on a column with rifle ready, or carrying a flag or bugle.
type 3 was an obelisk, often covered with drapery and bearing cannon balls or an urn.
this type was 28% of the monuments studied, but 48% of the monuments in cemeteries and 18% of courthouse monuments.
type 4 was a miscellaneous group, including arches, standing stones, plaques, fountains, etc.
these account for 17% of the monuments studied.
over a third of the courthouse monuments were specifically dedicated to the confederate dead.
the first courthouse monument was erected in bolivar, tennessee, in 1867. by 1880 nine courthouse monuments had been erected.
winberry noted two centers of courthouse monuments: the potomac counties of virginia, from which the tradition spread to north carolina, and a larger area covering georgia, south carolina and northern florida.
the diffusion of courthouse monuments was aided by organizations such as the united confederate veterans and their publications, though other factors may also have been effective.
winberry listed four reasons for the shift from cemeteries to courthouses.
first was the need to preserve the memory of the confederate dead and also recognize the veterans who returned.
second was to celebrate the rebuilding of the south after the war.
third was the romanticizing of the lost cause, and the fourth was to unify the white population in a common heritage against the interests of african-american southerners.
he concluded: "no one of these four possible explanations for the confederate monument is adequate or complete in itself.
the monument is a symbol, but whether it was a memory of the past, a celebration of the present, or a portent of the future remains a difficult question to answer; monuments and symbols can be complicated and sometimes indecipherable."
as of june 19, over 12 confederate monuments had been vandalized in 2019, usually with paint.
as of april 2017, at least 60 symbols of the confederacy had been removed or renamed since 2015, according to the southern poverty law center (splc).
at the same time, laws in various southern states place restrictions on, or prohibit altogether, the removal of statutes and memorials and the renaming of parks, roads, and schools.
a 2017 reuters poll found that 54% of adults stated that the monuments should remain in all public spaces, and 27% said they should be removed, while 19% said they were unsure.
the results were split along racial and political lines, with republicans and whites preferring to keep the monuments in place, while democrats and minorities were more likely to support their removal.
a similar 2017 poll by huffpost/yougov found that one-third of respondents favored removal, while 49% were opposed.
confederate monuments are widely distributed across the southern united states.
the distribution pattern follows the general political boundaries of the confederacy.
of the more than 1503 public monuments and memorials to the confederacy, more than 718 are monuments and statues.
nearly 300 monuments and statues are in georgia, virginia, or north carolina.
according to one researcher, "the absence of monuments in eastern tennessee and western north carolina indicates those regions' union sentiment, and the few monuments in maryland, west virginia, and kentucky reflect those states' ambivalent war-time politics."
the northern states that remained part of the union, as well as the western states that were largely settled after the civil war, have few or no memorials to the confederacy.
there are 10 major u.s. military bases named in honor of confederate military leaders, all in former confederate states.
in 2015 the pentagon declared it would not be renaming these facilities, and declined to make further comment in 2017.
several ships named for confederate leaders fell into union hands during the civil war.
the union navy retained the names of these ships while turning their guns against the confederacy:

site of confederate park // local businessman khleber m. van zandt organized the robert e. lee camp of the united confederate veterans in 1889. by 1900 it boasted more than 700 members.
the club received a 25-year charter to create the confederate park association in 1901, then purchased 373 acres (151 ha) near this site for the "recreation, refuge and relief of confederate soldiers" and their families.
opening events included a picnic for veterans and families on june 20, 1902, and a statewide reunion september 8–12, 1902, with 3,500 attendees.
the park thrived as a center for the civil and social activities on texas confederate organizations.
by 1924 the numbers [ sic ] of surviving veterans had greatly diminished, and the confederate park association dissolved when its charter expired in 1926.

old palapye is a heritage site located in botswana, near a town called palapye.
old palapye and palapye are two different places according to the residents there, palapye is a modernised town.
the site is located 20 km away from the palapye town and the people living around call it malaka village this monument site is called old palapye because it carries the history of the ancient nature which differentiates it from the palapye town.
old palapye is a crucial site which has many artifacts in it from the middle, late and stone age history.
old palapye became famous because the remains of the ngwato capital which was found in the year 1889 during the ruling of the famous kgosi khama iii from 1889-1902. kgosi khama iii initially lived in a village called shoshong village and later moved to old palapye because of shortage of water in shoshong.he later moved to serowe due to the same reason he moved from shoshong.

the confederate private monument is a bronze sculpture of a private of the confederate states army in centennial park, nashville, tennessee, united states.
designed by george julian zolnay, it was commissioned by the frank cheatham bivouac of the united confederate veterans in 1903, laid with masonic honors in 1907, and dedicated in 1909. it was vandalized in june 2019.
the monument consists of a statue of a confederate private in a uniform with a rifle.
according to the smithsonian institution, the private is sam davis (although newspaper articles published at the time do not mention him).
the smithsonian adds, "the butt of the rifle rests on the rocky stone ledge on which davis is seated.
he faces forward with his proper left hand resting between his knees.
davis is seated on a rough-cut stone atop a tapering base."
the monument includes a plaque with the names of 540 members of the frank cheatham bivouac.
theodore cooley, a member of the frank cheatham bivouac of the united confederate veterans, suggested commissioning a monument in 1902. by 1903, he assembled a group of confederate veterans to work on the project, and they hired sculptor george julian zolnay, who had designed many other confederate sculptures, to do it.
when cooley died, major b. m. hord became the chairman of the committee.
the monument cost $4,000 to build.
zolnay donated $500; the frank cheatham bivouac of the united confederate veterans raised $1000, the united daughters of the confederacy raised more than $1,000, and the rest was covered by smaller donors.
by 1907, the cornerstone was "laid with masonic honors by the grand lodge of the state."
the monument also includes a plaque with the names of 540 members of the frank cheatham bivouac.
the monument was dedicated in centennial park on june 19, 1909. henry watterson gave a speech that celebrated tennessee for having the courage to leave the union and stated "greece had its marathon; let shiloh, murfreesboro and chichamauga tell the story of tennessee."
zolnay gave a speech in front of the crowd highlighting that his wife was a southerner, and judge s. f. wilson gave another speech about the fighting spirit of the private soldier in the csa.
it was "unveiled in the presence of an immense crowd of people," to the sound of "dixie".
in a speech, henry watterson combined a veneration of southern glory with a consecration of the dead to the reconciliation of the living.
although he emphasized divine will, he differed from other united confederate veteran speakers in that he depicted god sacrificing the men of both sections to a new union.
through veneration of things memorable, magnificent, and courageous, he aroused feelings of pride, patriotism, and loyalty to the new union.
in appealing to things memorable, he transferred elements of the gospels to southern history to heighten the sense of divine destiny in reconciliation.
he recounted the magnificence and courage of tennesseeans to highlight their conduct in war and their conciliatory spirit in peace.
the statue was vandalized with red paint on june 17, 2019. the vandal(s) also painted "they were racists" on the plaque with the names of the 540 confederate veterans.
at the time when the monument was installed, tennessee had legal racial segregation in public schools, parks and other facilities.
african americans were forbidden to use the public pool at centennial park.
twenty-first century opponents of maintaining confederate monuments have noted the white supremacy of such post-reconstruction history as part of the context of the installation of the monuments and say they should be removed from public places.
monument one is a boundary marker on the maine - new brunswick border.
it was erected in 1843, the first permanent marker on the canada–united states border.
surveyors erected the first marker in 1797, consisting of iron hoops around a yellow birch tree, with a stake in the ground nearby.
a square cedar post was installed on july 31, 1817. the permanent cast iron marker was installed in 1843, after the signing of the webster–ashburton treaty.

the smelt monument is a monument in castletown, isle of man built to commemorate the life of cornelius smelt, the first royally appointed lieutenant governor of the isle of man, who died in 1832. work on the monument began in 1836, and ceased the following year.
it was built to a design by john welch at a cost of £180.
it is a column of the grecian doric order built from locally sourced stone, the work being undertaken by john thomas.
it was listed as a registered building of the isle of man in 1984.
the smelt monument was erected on a site which was formerly occupied by an ancient market cross.
it was on this site in 1617 that margaret inequane and her son were burned at the stake having been found guilty of witchcraft.
after the death of cornelius smelt in 1832, sir william hillary, a friend of smelt's, proposed that a memorial be built in his honour.
a meeting was called at the seneschal's office, seneschal lane, douglas, on 18 august 1835, where it was decided that a column should be erected, financed partly from funds then being held in holmes' bank and intended for a portrait of smelt.
a further £200 was raised, and john welch, an architect, drew up two designs, one for an obelisk, and the other a grecian doric.
following deliberation the grecian doric design was decided upon, and the contract was awarded to john thomas, the consideration being £180.
at a further meeting at the george inn in castletown it was resolved to site the monument at the intersection of the college and castletown roads, near hango hill, and space was set aside for the construction.
however this met with a strong objection from deemster john christian.
deemster christian suggested the monument be sited either in front of king william's college or on the parade.
it was subsequently decided to site the monument on the parade, castletown, facing castle rushen.
welch was well known to sir william hillary being responsible for the design of the tower of refuge, and the architect's services were requisitioned for the smelt memorial scheme.
a request was made to welch by the committee to:
"furnish estimates for two columns not exceeding £200 each, the one of a grecian doric column, the other an obelisk."
it was fully intended that there was to be an official first stone laying, to be undertaken by sir william.
but there was such a delay in arranging this that the contractor had to start work, and by the end of october 1836, the masons had a portion of the column built.
no formal stone laying ceremony was carried out.
the work was completed in early january 1837.
various rumours persist regarding the placing of a statue of cornelius smelt on top of the monument; a particular one suggests that funds had been exhausted and there was no money available for a statue.
therefore the following letter from sir william hillary to john mchutchin, the clerk of the rolls on the subject of a surmounting statue is of particular interest.
"my dear sir,
it has afforded me much pleasure to hear that the monument is now so advanced that its effect can be seen and understood by everyone, and that it meets with almost general approbation.
we must, however, feel that something is still wanting to render the work complete.
you are aware that it was first proposed to place an urn which would have cost at least £10 on the summit, which no doubt would have a good effect, but not in any respect equal to a statue of our late friend, nor so calculated to hand down his memory in the most gratifying manner to future generations.
i have therefore been most anxious this should, if possible, be accomplished, and have caused enquiries to be made in england by mr welch, as to the terms on which a statue rather larger than life, cut in hard and durable stone by an able artist, could be procured.
the result of these enquiries has been that about £40 would be requisite, for which it might be executed in a manner worthy of the monument on which it is proposed to be placed.
i hope there is a feeling amongst many of the friends of the deceased to add this testimony of their respect to his memory, and that by a separate subscription sufficient funds may without difficulty be obtained.
if you approve this measure, will you have the kindness to consult the gentlemen of your neighbourhood as the most prompt steps to be taken that the whole work be finished without delay.
i have understood mr gawne has expressed his readiness to contribute very liberally, but you will be the best judge as to the mode of proceeding.
not any scale can be fixed, but i am ready to put down my name for any sum from £1 to £5 which you and any other friend of the late governor smelt may be willing to contribute.
if the plan is approved our high bailiff will, i doubt not, render me his aid in procuring subscriptions here.
it is particularly to be desired that we should obtain a profile likeness of the late governor, by the aid of which, and the portrait in the possession of captain bacon, an experienced artist would be able to procure a likeness sufficiently striking for so elevated a situation.
will you have the goodness to enquire if such a profile or other likeness exists in castletown?
i have suggested that the figure should be calculated a simple but bold effect - perhaps having a military cloak thrown loosely over his other dress - one hand resting on the sword of state, the other to hold a scroll of paper, as denoting his civil functions.
his thinly scattered hair to show his fine open forehead, as seen before he wore a wig in his later days.
i believe it would accord better with the size of the column that the statute should not much exceed the natural height, perhaps about 7 feet high would be sufficient.
we must rely upon you for a correct translation into the manx language of the inscription to be placed on the pedestal which, with the arms of the island and the smelt family, will be amongst the last parts of the work executed.
i should be happy further to confer with you on the subject when you next visit douglas, and beg you to believe me."
sir william hillary did not receive sufficient support for his scheme to erect a statue.
the reference in his letter to a "portrait in the possession of capt.
bacon;" concerns the smelt portrait, a painting of cornelius smelt by thomas barber.
in addition to the smelt monument, john welch designed numerous buildings on the isle of man; two of the most prominent being the tower of refuge and king william's college.
the shrine of bahauddin zakariya (urdu: بہاؤ الدین زکریا درگاہ‎) is a 13th-century shrine located in the city of multan, in pakistan's punjab province.
the tomb is dedicated to the muslim mystic bahauddin zakariya, founder of the suhrawardiyya order of sufism.
it considered to be one of the most important shrines in southern punjab province, and is the prototype for multan's distinct architectural style.
the shrine is located in central multan, immediately north of its old walled city.
the shrine stands next to the remains of the ancient hindu prahladpuri temple.
by the 13th century, the belief that the spiritual powers of great sufi saints were attached to their burial sites was widespread in the muslim world, and so a shrine was built to commemorate the burial site of bahauddin zakariya.
in keeping with sufi tradition in punjab, the shrine's influence is augmented by smaller shrines spread throughout the region around multan.
these secondary shrines form a wilayat, or a "spiritual territory" of the primary shrine.
as home to the primary shrine, multan serves as the capital of bahauddin zakariya's wilayat.
the shrine's wilayat is noted to border the spiritual territory of the shrine of baba farid, based in pakpattan.
the shrine was built in 1262 before the death of zakariya in 1268. unusual for a dervish, the structure was paid for at the expense of bahauddin zakariya - highlighting his unique financial independence.
dara shikoh unsuccessfully attempted to win the loyalty of multan's citizens by donating 25,000 rupees to the shrine following his defeat by his brother at the battle of samugarh in 1658.
the shrine's sajjada nashin, or hereditary caretaker, makhdoom mahmud assisted british forces against sikh forces during the siege of multan in 1848. the shrine's cupola and part of its upper tier were damaged during the siege by british cannonballs, but were repaired soon afterwards.
the mausoleum was built as a two-tiered structure that is the prototype for early shrines throughout southern punjab.
the mausoleum's base is the shape of a square, built over an area of 51 ft 9 in (15.77 m).
above the square base is an octagonal tier, about half the height of the square, which is topped by a white hemispherical dome.
a vast courtyard surrounds the shrine that covers several hundreds square metres.
the walls surrounding the courtyard were built by the durrani governor of multan, nawab ali mohammad khan khakwani in the 18th century.
the mausoleum is built of brick, and is the earlier building to be decorated with glazed blue tiles, which later became a typical style of multan and south punjab.
the use of blue tiles reflects the influence of immigrant architects from central asia, who were active in the region in the 13th century.
a spacious brick verandah with a painted wooden ceiling was added to the shrine in 1952. large wooden doors provide entry into the inner sanctum of the shrine from the veranda.
the shrine is surrounded by hundreds of secondary graves belonging to descendants and devotees of bahauddin zakariya.
a small mosque also forms part of the complex, and is directly adjacent to the ruins of the prahladpuri temple.
qawwali songs and trance-like dancing are performed nightly after evening prayers at the shrine.
the shrine is important to members of the barelvi sect of islam, while orthodox deobandis shun the shrine and practices performed there.
devotees at the shrine perform the ritual of mannat, or tying threads throughout the shrine as symbols of prayer.
the shrine is popularly believed to protect boatsmen on the indus river and chenab river.
a class of devotees known as qureishi, associate themselves with zakariya and claim descent from the quraysh tribe of the prophet muhammed.
the qureishi are held in high-esteem throughout saraiki regions in pakistan.
one of the qureishi, shah mehmood qureshi, rose to the position of pakistan's minister of foreign affairs.
hereditary caretakers of the shrine, known as sajjada nashin claim descent from zakariya.
some caretakers have been held in high-esteem, and have maintained influence in politics.
shah mehmood qureshi, member of the pakistan tehreek-e-insaf political party, was sajjada nashin of the shrine, but was removed from this post in 2014 after protest from devotees against the alleged use of his position as a means to secure political power.
supplicants occasionally gather at the entrance to the mausoleum

devotees and pilgrims tie strings to the shrine as a supplication and request for intercession known as mannat
this is a list of confederate monuments and memorials that were established as public displays and symbols of the confederate states of america (csa), confederate leaders, or confederate soldiers of the american civil war.
part of the commemoration of the american civil war, these symbols include monuments and statues, flags, holidays and other observances, and the names of schools, roads, parks, bridges, counties, cities, lakes, dams, military bases, and other public works.
in a december 2018 special report, smithsonian magazine stated, "over the past ten years, taxpayers have directed at least $40 million to confederate monuments—statues, homes, parks, museums, libraries and cemeteries—and to confederate heritage organizations."
monuments and memorials are listed below alphabetically by state, and by city within each state.
states not listed have no known qualifying items for the list.
for monuments and memorials which have been removed, consult removal of confederate monuments and memorials.
this list does not include the removal of figures connected with the origins of the civil war or white supremacy, but not with the confederacy, including statues of supreme court justice roger b. taney in annapolis, baltimore, and frederick, maryland, a controversial portrait of north carolina chief justice thomas ruffin, and numerous memorials to southern politician john c. calhoun (commemorated on the confederacy's 1¢ stamp), although monuments to calhoun "have been the most consistent targets" of vandals.
it also does not include post-civil war white supremacists, such as north carolina governor charles aycock and mississippi governor james k. vardaman, some of whose monuments are also being removed (see charles brantley aycock#legacy) and james k. vardaman#personal life, death and legacy).
memorials have been erected on public spaces (including on courthouse grounds) either at public expense or funded by private organizations and donors.
numerous private memorials have also been erected.
according to smithsonian magazine, "confederate monuments aren't just heirlooms, the artifacts of a bygone era.
instead, american taxpayers are still heavily investing in these tributes today."
the report also concluded that the monuments were constructed and are regularly maintained in promotion of lost cause, white supremacist mythology, and over the many decades of their establishment, african american leaders regularly protested these memorials and what they represented.
a small number of memorializations were made during the war, mainly as ship and place names.
after the war, robert e. lee said on several occasions that he was opposed to any monuments, as they would, in his opinion, "keep open the sores of war".
nevertheless, monuments and memorials continued to be dedicated shortly after the american civil war.
[better source needed] many more monuments were dedicated in the years after 1890, when congress established the first national military park at chickamauga and chattanooga, and by the turn of the twentieth century, five battlefields from the civil war had been preserved: chickamauga-chattanooga,antietam, gettysburg, shiloh, and vicksburg.
at vicksburg national military park, more than 95 percent of the park's monuments were erected in the first eighteen years after the park was established in 1899.
confederate monument-building has often been part of widespread campaigns to promote and justify jim crow laws in the south, and assert white supremacy.
according to the american historical association (aha), the erection of confederate monuments during the early twentieth century was "part and parcel of the initiation of legally mandated segregation and widespread disenfranchisement across the south."
according to the aha, memorials to the confederacy erected during this period "were intended, in part, to obscure the terrorism required to overthrow reconstruction, and to intimidate african americans politically and isolate them from the mainstream of public life."
a later wave of monument building coincided with the civil rights movement, and according to the aha "these symbols of white supremacy are still being invoked for similar purposes."
according to smithsonian magazine, "far from simply being markers of historic events and people, as proponents argue, these memorials were created and funded by jim crow governments to pay homage to a slave-owning society and to serve as blunt assertions of dominance over african-americans.
"this is a modern interpretation of the motive for monuments.
honoring ancestors is an ancient tradition and is still present in our society.
according to historian jane dailey from the university of chicago, in many cases, the purpose of the monuments was not to celebrate the past but rather to promote a "white supremacist future".
another historian, karen l. cox, from the university of north carolina at charlotte, has written that the monuments are "a legacy of the brutally racist jim crow era", and that "the whole point of confederate monuments is to celebrate white supremacy".
another historian from unc, james leloudis, stated that "the funders and backers of these monuments are very explicit that they are requiring a political education and a legitimacy for the jim crow era and the right of white men to rule."
they were erected without the consent or even input of southern african americans, who remembered the civil war far differently, and who had no interest in honoring those who fought to keep them enslaved.
according to civil war historian judith giesberg, professor of history at villanova university, "white supremacy is really what these participation trophy represent."
some monuments were also meant to beautify cities as part of the city beautiful movement, although this was secondary.
in a june 2018 speech, civil war historian james i. robertson jr. of virginia tech university said the monuments were not a "jim crow signal of defiance" and referred to the current trend to dismantle or destroy them as an "age of idiocy" motivated by "elements hell-bent on tearing apart unity that generations of americans have painfully constructed."
katrina dunn johnson, curator at south carolina's confederate relic room and military museum, states that "thousands of families throughout the country were unable to reclaim their soldier's remains--many never learned their loved ones' exact fate on the battlefield or within the prison camps.
the psychological impact of such a devastating loss cannot be underestimated when attempting to understand the primary motivations behind southern memorialization."
many confederate monuments were dedicated in the former confederate states and border states in the decades following the civil war, in many instances by ladies memorial associations, united daughters of the confederacy (udc), united confederate veterans (ucv), sons of confederate veterans (scv), the heritage preservation association, and other memorial organizations.
other confederate monuments are located on civil war battlefields.
many confederate monuments are listed on the national register of historic places, either separately or as contributing objects within listings of courthouses or historic districts.
art historians cynthia mills and pamela simpson argued, in monuments to the lost cause, that the majority of confederate monuments, of the type they define, were "commissioned by white women, in hope of preserving a positive vision of antebellum life."
in the late nineteenth century, technological innovations in the granite and bronze industries helped reduce costs and made monuments more affordable for small towns.
companies looking to capitalize on this opportunity often sold nearly identical copies of monuments to both the north and south.
another wave of monument construction coincided with the civil rights movement and the american civil war centennial.
at least thirty-two confederate monuments were dedicated between 2000 and 2017, including at least 7 re-dedications.
scholarly studies of the monuments began in the 1980s.
in 1983 john j. winberry published a study which was based on data from the work of r.w.
widener.
he estimated that the main building period for monuments was from 1889 to 1929 and that of the monuments erected in courthouse squares over half were built between 1902 and 1912. he determined four main locations for monuments; battlefields, cemeteries, county courthouse grounds, and state capitol grounds.
over a third of the courthouse monuments were dedicated to the dead.
the majority of the cemetery monuments in his study were built in the pre-1900 period, while most of the courthouse monuments were erected after 1900. of the 666 monuments in his study 55% were of confederate soldiers, while 28% were obelisks.
soldiers dominated courthouse grounds, while obelisks account for nearly half of cemetery monuments.
the idea that the soldier statues always faced north was found to be untrue and that the soldiers usually faced the same direction as the courthouse.
he noted that the monuments were "remarkably diverse" with "only a few instances of repetition of inscriptions".
he categorized the monuments into four types.
type 1 was a confederate soldier on a column with his weapon at parade rest, or weaponless and gazing into the distance.
these accounted for approximately half the monuments studied.
they are, however, the most popular among the courthouse monuments.
type 2 was a confederate soldier on a column with rifle ready, or carrying a flag or bugle.
type 3 was an obelisk, often covered with drapery and bearing cannon balls or an urn.
this type was 28% of the monuments studied, but 48% of the monuments in cemeteries and 18% of courthouse monuments.
type 4 was a miscellaneous group, including arches, standing stones, plaques, fountains, etc.
these account for 17% of the monuments studied.
over a third of the courthouse monuments were specifically dedicated to the confederate dead.
the first courthouse monument was erected in bolivar, tennessee, in 1867. by 1880 nine courthouse monuments had been erected.
winberry noted two centers of courthouse monuments: the potomac counties of virginia, from which the tradition spread to north carolina, and a larger area covering georgia, south carolina and northern florida.
the diffusion of courthouse monuments was aided by organizations such as the united confederate veterans and their publications, though other factors may also have been effective.
winberry listed four reasons for the shift from cemeteries to courthouses.
first was the need to preserve the memory of the confederate dead and also recognize the veterans who returned.
second was to celebrate the rebuilding of the south after the war.
third was the romanticizing of the lost cause, and the fourth was to unify the white population in a common heritage against the interests of african-american southerners.
he concluded: "no one of these four possible explanations for the confederate monument is adequate or complete in itself.
the monument is a symbol, but whether it was a memory of the past, a celebration of the present, or a portent of the future remains a difficult question to answer; monuments and symbols can be complicated and sometimes indecipherable."
as of june 19, over 12 confederate monuments had been vandalized in 2019, usually with paint.
as of april 2017, at least 60 symbols of the confederacy had been removed or renamed since 2015, according to the southern poverty law center (splc).
at the same time, laws in various southern states place restrictions on, or prohibit altogether, the removal of statutes and memorials and the renaming of parks, roads, and schools.
a 2017 reuters poll found that 54% of adults stated that the monuments should remain in all public spaces, and 27% said they should be removed, while 19% said they were unsure.
the results were split along racial and political lines, with republicans and whites preferring to keep the monuments in place, while democrats and minorities were more likely to support their removal.
a similar 2017 poll by huffpost/yougov found that one-third of respondents favored removal, while 49% were opposed.
confederate monuments are widely distributed across the southern united states.
the distribution pattern follows the general political boundaries of the confederacy.
of the more than 1503 public monuments and memorials to the confederacy, more than 718 are monuments and statues.
nearly 300 monuments and statues are in georgia, virginia, or north carolina.
according to one researcher, "the absence of monuments in eastern tennessee and western north carolina indicates those regions' union sentiment, and the few monuments in maryland, west virginia, and kentucky reflect those states' ambivalent war-time politics."
the northern states that remained part of the union, as well as the western states that were largely settled after the civil war, have few or no memorials to the confederacy.
there are 10 major u.s. military bases named in honor of confederate military leaders, all in former confederate states.
in 2015 the pentagon declared it would not be renaming these facilities, and declined to make further comment in 2017.
several ships named for confederate leaders fell into union hands during the civil war.
the union navy retained the names of these ships while turning their guns against the confederacy:

site of confederate park // local businessman khleber m. van zandt organized the robert e. lee camp of the united confederate veterans in 1889. by 1900 it boasted more than 700 members.
the club received a 25-year charter to create the confederate park association in 1901, then purchased 373 acres (151 ha) near this site for the "recreation, refuge and relief of confederate soldiers" and their families.
opening events included a picnic for veterans and families on june 20, 1902, and a statewide reunion september 8–12, 1902, with 3,500 attendees.
the park thrived as a center for the civil and social activities on texas confederate organizations.
by 1924 the numbers [ sic ] of surviving veterans had greatly diminished, and the confederate park association dissolved when its charter expired in 1926.

this is a list of confederate monuments and memorials that were established as public displays and symbols of the confederate states of america (csa), confederate leaders, or confederate soldiers of the american civil war.
part of the commemoration of the american civil war, these symbols include monuments and statues, flags, holidays and other observances, and the names of schools, roads, parks, bridges, counties, cities, lakes, dams, military bases, and other public works.
in a december 2018 special report, smithsonian magazine stated, "over the past ten years, taxpayers have directed at least $40 million to confederate monuments—statues, homes, parks, museums, libraries and cemeteries—and to confederate heritage organizations."
monuments and memorials are listed below alphabetically by state, and by city within each state.

memorials have been erected on public spaces (including on courthouse grounds) either at public expense or funded by private organizations and donors.
numerous private memorials have also been erected.
according to smithsonian magazine, "confederate monuments aren't just heirlooms, the artifacts of a bygone era.
instead, american taxpayers are still heavily investing in these tributes today."
the report also concluded that the monuments were constructed and are regularly maintained in promotion of lost cause, white supremacist mythology, and over the many decades of their establishment, african american leaders regularly protested these memorials and what they represented.
a small number of memorializations were made during the war, mainly as ship and place names.
after the war, robert e. lee said on several occasions that he was opposed to any monuments, as they would, in his opinion, "keep open the sores of war".
nevertheless, monuments and memorials continued to be dedicated shortly after the american civil war.
[better source needed] many more monuments were dedicated in the years after 1890, when congress established the first national military park at chickamauga and chattanooga, and by the turn of the twentieth century, five battlefields from the civil war had been preserved: chickamauga-chattanooga,antietam, gettysburg, shiloh, and vicksburg.
at vicksburg national military park, more than 95 percent of the park's monuments were erected in the first eighteen years after the park was established in 1899.
confederate monument-building has often been part of widespread campaigns to promote and justify jim crow laws in the south, and assert white supremacy.
according to the american historical association (aha), the erection of confederate monuments during the early twentieth century was "part and parcel of the initiation of legally mandated segregation and widespread disenfranchisement across the south."
according to the aha, memorials to the confederacy erected during this period "were intended, in part, to obscure the terrorism required to overthrow reconstruction, and to intimidate african americans politically and isolate them from the mainstream of public life."
a later wave of monument building coincided with the civil rights movement, and according to the aha "these symbols of white supremacy are still being invoked for similar purposes."
according to smithsonian magazine, "far from simply being markers of historic events and people, as proponents argue, these memorials were created and funded by jim crow governments to pay homage to a slave-owning society and to serve as blunt assertions of dominance over african-americans.
"this is a modern interpretation of the motive for monuments.
honoring ancestors is an ancient tradition and is still present in our society.
according to historian jane dailey from the university of chicago, in many cases, the purpose of the monuments was not to celebrate the past but rather to promote a "white supremacist future".
another historian, karen l. cox, from the university of north carolina at charlotte, has written that the monuments are "a legacy of the brutally racist jim crow era", and that "the whole point of confederate monuments is to celebrate white supremacy".
another historian from unc, james leloudis, stated that "the funders and backers of these monuments are very explicit that they are requiring a political education and a legitimacy for the jim crow era and the right of white men to rule."
they were erected without the consent or even input of southern african americans, who remembered the civil war far differently, and who had no interest in honoring those who fought to keep them enslaved.
according to civil war historian judith giesberg, professor of history at villanova university, "white supremacy is really what these participation trophy represent."
some monuments were also meant to beautify cities as part of the city beautiful movement, although this was secondary.
in a june 2018 speech, civil war historian james i. robertson jr. of virginia tech university said the monuments were not a "jim crow signal of defiance" and referred to the current trend to dismantle or destroy them as an "age of idiocy" motivated by "elements hell-bent on tearing apart unity that generations of americans have painfully constructed."
katrina dunn johnson, curator at south carolina's confederate relic room and military museum, states that "thousands of families throughout the country were unable to reclaim their soldier's remains--many never learned their loved ones' exact fate on the battlefield or within the prison camps.
the psychological impact of such a devastating loss cannot be underestimated when attempting to understand the primary motivations behind southern memorialization."
many confederate monuments were dedicated in the former confederate states and border states in the decades following the civil war, in many instances by ladies memorial associations, united daughters of the confederacy (udc), united confederate veterans (ucv), sons of confederate veterans (scv), the heritage preservation association, and other memorial organizations.
other confederate monuments are located on civil war battlefields.
many confederate monuments are listed on the national register of historic places, either separately or as contributing objects within listings of courthouses or historic districts.
art historians cynthia mills and pamela simpson argued, in monuments to the lost cause, that the majority of confederate monuments, of the type they define, were "commissioned by white women, in hope of preserving a positive vision of antebellum life."
in the late nineteenth century, technological innovations in the granite and bronze industries helped reduce costs and made monuments more affordable for small towns.
companies looking to capitalize on this opportunity often sold nearly identical copies of monuments to both the north and south.
another wave of monument construction coincided with the civil rights movement and the american civil war centennial.
at least thirty-two confederate monuments were dedicated between 2000 and 2017, including at least 7 re-dedications.
scholarly studies of the monuments began in the 1980s.
in 1983 john j. winberry published a study which was based on data from the work of r.w.
widener.
he estimated that the main building period for monuments was from 1889 to 1929 and that of the monuments erected in courthouse squares over half were built between 1902 and 1912. he determined four main locations for monuments; battlefields, cemeteries, county courthouse grounds, and state capitol grounds.
over a third of the courthouse monuments were dedicated to the dead.
the majority of the cemetery monuments in his study were built in the pre-1900 period, while most of the courthouse monuments were erected after 1900. of the 666 monuments in his study 55% were of confederate soldiers, while 28% were obelisks.
soldiers dominated courthouse grounds, while obelisks account for nearly half of cemetery monuments.
the idea that the soldier statues always faced north was found to be untrue and that the soldiers usually faced the same direction as the courthouse.
he noted that the monuments were "remarkably diverse" with "only a few instances of repetition of inscriptions".
he categorized the monuments into four types.
type 1 was a confederate soldier on a column with his weapon at parade rest, or weaponless and gazing into the distance.
these accounted for approximately half the monuments studied.
they are, however, the most popular among the courthouse monuments.
type 2 was a confederate soldier on a column with rifle ready, or carrying a flag or bugle.
type 3 was an obelisk, often covered with drapery and bearing cannon balls or an urn.
this type was 28% of the monuments studied, but 48% of the monuments in cemeteries and 18% of courthouse monuments.
type 4 was a miscellaneous group, including arches, standing stones, plaques, fountains, etc.
these account for 17% of the monuments studied.
over a third of the courthouse monuments were specifically dedicated to the confederate dead.
the first courthouse monument was erected in bolivar, tennessee, in 1867. by 1880 nine courthouse monuments had been erected.
winberry noted two centers of courthouse monuments: the potomac counties of virginia, from which the tradition spread to north carolina, and a larger area covering georgia, south carolina and northern florida.
the diffusion of courthouse monuments was aided by organizations such as the united confederate veterans and their publications, though other factors may also have been effective.
winberry listed four reasons for the shift from cemeteries to courthouses.
first was the need to preserve the memory of the confederate dead and also recognize the veterans who returned.
second was to celebrate the rebuilding of the south after the war.
third was the romanticizing of the lost cause, and the fourth was to unify the white population in a common heritage against the interests of african-american southerners.
he concluded: "no one of these four possible explanations for the confederate monument is adequate or complete in itself.
the monument is a symbol, but whether it was a memory of the past, a celebration of the present, or a portent of the future remains a difficult question to answer; monuments and symbols can be complicated and sometimes indecipherable."
as of june 19, over 12 confederate monuments had been vandalized in 2019, usually with paint.
as of april 2017, at least 60 symbols of the confederacy had been removed or renamed since 2015, according to the southern poverty law center (splc).
at the same time, laws in various southern states place restrictions on, or prohibit altogether, the removal of statutes and memorials and the renaming of parks, roads, and schools.
a 2017 reuters poll found that 54% of adults stated that the monuments should remain in all public spaces, and 27% said they should be removed, while 19% said they were unsure.
the results were split along racial and political lines, with republicans and whites preferring to keep the monuments in place, while democrats and minorities were more likely to support their removal.
a similar 2017 poll by huffpost/yougov found that one-third of respondents favored removal, while 49% were opposed.
confederate monuments are widely distributed across the southern united states.
the distribution pattern follows the general political boundaries of the confederacy.
of the more than 1503 public monuments and memorials to the confederacy, more than 718 are monuments and statues.
nearly 300 monuments and statues are in georgia, virginia, or north carolina.
according to one researcher, "the absence of monuments in eastern tennessee and western north carolina indicates those regions' union sentiment, and the few monuments in maryland, west virginia, and kentucky reflect those states' ambivalent war-time politics."
the northern states that remained part of the union, as well as the western states that were largely settled after the civil war, have few or no memorials to the confederacy.
there are 10 major u.s. military bases named in honor of confederate military leaders, all in former confederate states.
in 2015 the pentagon declared it would not be renaming these facilities, and declined to make further comment in 2017.
several ships named for confederate leaders fell into union hands during the civil war.
the union navy retained the names of these ships while turning their guns against the confederacy:

site of confederate park // local businessman khleber m. van zandt organized the robert e. lee camp of the united confederate veterans in 1889. by 1900 it boasted more than 700 members.
the club received a 25-year charter to create the confederate park association in 1901, then purchased 373 acres (151 ha) near this site for the "recreation, refuge and relief of confederate soldiers" and their families.
opening events included a picnic for veterans and families on june 20, 1902, and a statewide reunion september 8–12, 1902, with 3,500 attendees.

lazaret meljine is a fortress and a military hospital built by the venetians in 1732 near the town of herceg novi (montenegro) in the village of meljine on the beach.
this institution performed quarantine functions, and also gave permission for the import or export of various products.
lazaret survived to this day.
meljine is a small tourist place on the montenegrin riviera in the bay of kotor, not far from the town of herceg novi.
this settlement is located on the coast in three kilometers to the east of the town of herceg novi and two kilometers to the west of the village of zelenika.
from here, along the "pet danica" embankment you can reach the igalo resort through herceg novi.
the cultural and historical monument lazaret, dating from 1732, is located exactly here.
in meljine, since the days of the venetian republic, there is a large hospital, which still operates today.
from meljine through the orjen mountain you can get to trebinje in bosnia and herzegovina (republika srpska).
this 150 km road shortens the existing route from serbia and bosnia and herzegovina to the montenegrin coast.
the territory around kotor was under the rule of venice from 1420. in 1482 herceg novi was conquered by the ottoman empire and held for two centuries with a brief break in 1538-1539, when the city was captured by the spaniards.
only in 1688 the venetians freed the city from the turks and included herceg novi in the venetian republic as part of the province "venetian albania" or "albania veneta".
in 1688 when the venetians managed to conquer herceg novi from ottoman empire, there was a need to complete the restructuring of the turkish public welfare which didn’t answer the modern standards of that time.
public health was one of the most important tasks for the new authorities.
moreover, releasing herceg novi, the first city at the entrance to the bay of kotor, venetians wanted to make this city the port.
therefore city needed quarantine, namely, to give permission for the import and export of various goods.
first quarantine which was called lazaret was organized in 1700 and was placed in herceg novi, near the old town, just below the catholic monastery of st. anthony.
in a few years it was decided to take it apart due to the danger of landslide as herceg novi is situated on the cliff and consists of solid slopes, hence it is often called the city of 10 000 steps.new lazaret was built in 3 years between 1729 and 1732 in the suburbs of the city in the village of meljine right on the shore of the sea.
it was a whole complex of buildings with the atrium and chapel.
outwardly, it resembled a small fortress, the only difference is that the walls were not as high and didn’t have the battlements.
great lazaret building has survived in the same shape to our days.
in the next century the austrians, new owners of lazaret, used this building for military purposes.
the lazaret often changed its owners, it can be said that it had a difficult fate.
in 1797 the province of venetian albania became part of the napoleonic kingdom of italy, and then in 1809 was incorporated into the french illyrian regions.
in 1814 they became part of the austrian empire, and then, after wwi from 1918 to yugoslavia before its collapse.
in this period it was used as children’s summer camp.
in 1741, to lazaret in meljine, a water pipe was installed from the savina monastery next to it, which was a progressive innovation for that time.
the huge building of the lazaret was perfectly preserved to this day, but the water pipe no longer functions.
for the construction of the hospital in meljine, the venetians used carved stone from which the monks of nearby savina monastery also built a new church.
the architecture of the ancient infirmary in meljine, like the military hospital of that time, resembles a defensive fortress.
behind the imposing walls is a large hospital building, in which prudent venetian architects have made not only the main entrance, but also a safety exit.
there are also three smaller buildings here.
in addition, the internal courtyard of the old hospital in meljine is decorated with a fountain and a small chapel dedicated to st. rock.
the hospital in meljine near herceg novi can be reached from the sea.
for this, the venetians built two piers for ships.
from the side of these berths there are views of the herceg novi hospital, with its green vegetation.
evergreen pines sometimes grow directly from the walls of the old infirmary and give the architecture of this structure the color of the ancient fortress.

now, in place of the old lazaret reconstruction and construction of a tourist complex is underway.
in the building of lazaret there will be a 5-star boutique hotel with residences, mediterranean restaurants, and a wellness center.

kolkata gate: the housing infrastructure development corporation (hidco) has set up the biswa bangla gate or kolkata gate on the major arterial road (part of biswa bangla sarani) in narkelbagan, action area - i of new town, kolkata.
the gate along with the restaurant is now open for public.
the visitors gallery and restaurant is surrounded by glass, which will be part of the wall.
from here, one can see a lot of parts of new town, bidhannagar, rajarhat and kolkata.
it is a type of welcome gate and is built by hidco, under the government of west bengal.
the design was finalised by calling for submission of designs through a public notice in web sites as well as newspaper advertisements.
a committee headed by architect dulal mukherjee was formed which evaluated the designs from various architects from around the country.
the design by m/s vector designs, a pune-based architecture firm was recommended by the committee.
a work order was soon  issued now that the design was accepted by the board of directors of hidco.
the hotel is successfully running with both staircases and a lift that carries visitors to the hotel and provide a marvelous view of neo city newtown.
narkelbagan crossing, near rabindra tirtha in action area 1, new town, kolkata.
the kolkata gate design was made public in 2015.   the construction of the gate started on 6 march 2017. the construction of the gate will use around 70 tons of steel .
the total cost of the construction of the gate is expected to be around ₹25 crore.
for the design of the iconic structure, a national design competition was organized and a committee headed by architect dulal mukherjee, oversaw design plans from architects from all over the country.
most were variations of the inverted ‘u’ and catered to the wish of making the gate a utility structure as well.the project finally went to m/s vector designs, a pune based company.
the construction was carried out by a pune firm construction catalysers pvt.limited.
the plan initially was to have just a viewing gallery, but later on, it was decided to have a night-time restaurant as well.
work on the proposed structure began on march 6, 2017. steel plates were used and two inverted parabolas were erected.
not a single piece of steel was curved and the whole structure was made from flat steel.
around 70 tons of steel were used with the top portion elevated at 55 metres.
all points were rigorously tested.the first sign of trouble came when the rings had to be elevated to the proposed height of 25 metres.
the arch wasn’t a problem since it was from the sides, but with the rings came a major traffic issue
to elevate the rings, the cross roads, on which the gate is constructed, needed to be closed down.
work was to be done through the night, between 11 pm and 5 am and permission for the same was taken from the police.
the ring had four parts, two large and two small.
the problem was lifting the larger parts to their designated spots and for that a full 48 uninterrupted hours would be required.
that became one of the main causes for delay.finally, the work went on uninterrupted over one whole weekend, with minimum inconvenience to traffic and the rings were elevated using large cranes.
curved, double glazed glasses, brought all the way from bengaluru, were used in the ring.
more than 20 per cent of these glasses broke on the way to kolkata and replacing them consumed even more time.the fire department then wanted staircases along with the glass capsule lifts as a safety measure since it was to be for public use and spiral staircases had to be installed.
the initial plan for the structure also included a biswa bangla globe to be installed.
one day, while it was being pulled up, the chain snapped and it crashed to the ground.
thankfully, no one was around at that time, but it was decided not to get another globe up again.
today,the gate stands at 55 meters - a ring — situated at a height of 25 metres and with a diameter of 220 meters around the kolkata gate - is a restaurant, a viewing gallery, a cafeteria and a curio shop.
the ring has the support of four arc-like pillars from four sides.
decorative paintings of luminaries have been drawn on the wall inside the ring with the outer side having a glass facade to have a view of the township.
not more than 50 visitors are allowed inside the ring at a time.<https://www.biswabanglagatekolkata.in/about.php>
this gate will be about 55 meters high.
the monotonous tunnel made for the viewers will be approximately 25 meters above the ground.
visitors can climb up the lifts on one side of the gate.
decorating the tunnels will be several photographs of the bengal culture, with adaptation.
the outer part of the entire tunnel will be have lighting.
the logo "welcome to kolkata" will be put up on the ring structure to greet the incoming vehicles.
this hanging restaurant is being developed as a part of newtown's beauty project.
from the idea of visitor's gallery in paris's eiffel tower and hanging restaurant in malaysia, hidco has built this gate and the accompanying hanging restaurant.

the wall of grief (russian: стена скорби, stena skorbi, sometimes translated as wall of sorrow) is a monument in moscow to the victims of political persecution by joseph stalin during the country's soviet era.
the national memorial was unveiled by russian president vladimir putin and patriarch kirill of moscow on october 30, 2017, the annual day of remembrance of the victims of political repressions.
from the 1920s to 1950s, under stalin's rule in the soviet union, an estimated 750,000 people were executed, in addition to the millions of victims who died as a result of famine, labor camp conditions and other atrocities committed by the government.
russian president vladimir putin ordered the construction of the monument in 2014. the city of moscow paid approximately $6 million of the cost, and roughly $800,000 more was contributed by individual and corporate donors.
after meeting with the country's human rights and civil society council, putin stated on october 30, 2017 during the opening ceremony that the tragedy must not be forgotten or justified, as "an unequivocal and clear assessment of the repression will help to prevent it being repeated".
the ceremony was witnessed by around 100 attendees, many of whom were senior citizens, human rights activists and government officials of moscow.
the monument is not the first of its kind, but it is the first built by presidential decree.
another monument, the solovetsky stone, was erected in 1990 and is located across from kgb headquarters in lubyanka square, moscow.
the wall of grief was built on an old parking lot at the busy intersection of garden ring road and academician sakharov avenue in central moscow.
georgy frangulyan, the designer of the monument who spent two years working on its creation, noted that the wall of grief is "an expression of feelings, of fear and alarm", rather than a "representative" work of art.
he explained that the location of the sculpture is meant to emphasize that "repression could happen anyplace".
the monument is made of bronze and its shape reflects the arc of a scythe.
a dark, curved wall that is approximately 100 feet (30 m) long and 20 feet (6.1 m) high serves as the primary part of the monument, on which there are numerous faceless human figures.
according to frangulyan, the wall's scythe form represents the grim reaper, while the indistinguishable human faces highlight "the victims' anonymity".
the unveiling of the monument was immediately followed by controversy, as some dissidents argued that the wall of grief is a symbol of "hypocrisy", and that the russian government's recent activities are no different from the political repressions they claim to oppose.
some 40 critics and dissidents, including alexander podrabinek, pavel litvinov, vladimir bukovsky and mustafa dzhemilev, published a petition accusing the government of "trying to whitewash the present".
they remarked in the petition that the kremlin sponsored the monument in order to "pretend that political repression is a thing long since past", whereas political prisoners in contemporary russia are urgently in need of "help and attention".
meanwhile, some people considered the monument "an important step" for the country.
elena b. zhemkova, chief operating officer of "memorial", an organization which archives records of repressed people, said that having the monument introduced by the state leadership symbolizes the country's recognition of terror and murder.
the director of the gulag history museum in moscow, roman romanov, said the support to the monument from both the president and ordinary citizens indicates "a new point of reckoning".

the shrine of khalid walid (urdu: مقبره خالد وليد‎) is a sufi shrine located in the village of nawan shehr, near the pakistani city of kabirwala.
the shrine is dedicated to the 12th century warrior-saint khaliq walid, popularly known instead as khalid walid (not to be confused with islam's khalid ibn walid of arabia).
the shrine dates from the period of the medieval delhi sultanate, and may be the earliest muslim funerary monument in south asia.
the shrine represents the first stage of evolution of funerary monuments in southern punjab which would later culminate with the tomb of shah rukn-e-alam in multan.
the tomb dates from between the last quarter of the 12th century, and the early decades of the 13th century.
the shrine bears an inscription stating that the shrine was built by ali bin karamakh, who served as governor of multan during the reign of muhammad of ghor.
the tomb was rediscovered and identified as the shrine of khalid walid by dr ahmad nabi khan and kamil khan.
the shrine assumes the form of a fortified rectangle measuring 70 by 90 feet, and is capped by a low and sloped dome, with an exterior made of plain brick and inward sloping walls that may derive from seljuk architecture from central asia.
the use of wooden bands horizontally across the shrine, and use of both glazed and cut brick also represents the influence of central asian seljuk architecture.
the shrine reflects elements of military architecture, with semicircular bastions in each of the shrine's corners, as well as in the middle of 3 of the 4 walls.
the western wall of the shrine features a small projection, indicating the location of the mihrab.
the roofline is decorated with crenellations - a feature commonly employed in fortified structures such as the rohtas fort.
similar influence of military architecture is found at the tomb of shah rukn-e-alam in multan.
the shrine's interior is square shaped measuring 24 feet on each side, with entrance on each side that open to vaulted galleries, and rectangular shaped chambers on the east and west side of the shrine.
the interior space is divided into a series of galleries the shrine's interior walls are decorated with cut-brick designs.
the shrine is notable for its exceptional mihrab made of cut and molded brick, decorated with kufic calligraphy, capped with a hood similar to a baldachin.
decorative cut-brick patterns on the ornate mihrab differ from patterns on the rest of the shrine.
casa grande (o'odham: wainom wo:g) is a city in pinal county, approximately halfway between phoenix and tucson in the u.s. state of arizona.
according to u.s. census estimates, the population of the city is 57,232 as of 2018. it is named after the casa grande ruins national monument, which is actually located in coolidge.
"casa grande" is spanish for "big house".
among resident english speakers, there is no consensus on how to pronounce the city's name.
casa grande was founded in 1879 by the carter family during the arizona mining boom, specifically due to the presence of the southern pacific railroad.
in january 1880, the community of terminus, meaning "end-of-the-line," was established despite consisting of just five residents and three buildings.
in september 1880, railroad executives renamed the settlement casa grande, after the hohokam ruins at the nearby casa grande ruins national monument.
casa grande grew slowly, and suffered several setbacks both in 1886 and 1893, when fires ravaged the town, destroying all wooden housing structures within it.

the winged victory of samothrace, also called the nike of samothrace, (greek: νίκη της σαμοθράκης niki tis samothrakis) is a marble hellenistic sculpture of nike (the greek goddess of victory), that was created in about the 2nd century bc.
since 1884, it has been prominently displayed at the louvre and is one of the most celebrated sculptures in the world.
h.w.
janson described it as "the greatest masterpiece of hellenistic sculpture".
the sculpture is one of a small number of major hellenistic statues surviving in the original, rather than roman copies.
only winged victory's right wing isn't original, and was added by mirroring the left wing.
the context of the winged victory of samothrace, discovered in 1863, is controversial, with proposals ranging from the battle of salamis in 306 bc to the battle of actium in 31 bc as the event being celebrated.
datings based on stylistic evaluation have been equally variable, ranging across the same three centuries, but perhaps tending to an earlier date.
for much of the 20th century, the prevailing theory, based on the works of hermann thiersch and karl lehmann, considered it a rhodian monument dedicated following the victories at side and myonessos in 190 bc, and suggested that it might have been carved by the rhodian sculptor pythocritus.
however, by the mid-2010s, the reconstructions of the monument proposed by lehmann have been shown to be false (the remains of the surrounding space that housed the victory belong to the roman period), and the question of why the statue was dedicated on samothrace, which at the time was dominated by the greek kingdom of macedonia, remains unanswered.
the statue is 244 centimetres (8.01 ft) high.
it was created not only to honour the goddess, nike, but probably also to commemorate a naval action.
it conveys a sense of action and triumph as well as portraying artful flowing drapery, as though the goddess were descending to alight upon the prow of a ship.
modern excavations suggest that the victory occupied a niche above a theater and also suggest it accompanied an altar that was within view of the ship monument of demetrius i poliorcetes (337–283 bc).
rendered in grey and white thasian and parian marble, the figure originally formed part of the samothrace temple complex dedicated to the great gods, megaloi theoi.
it stood on a rostral pedestal of gray marble from lartos representing the prow of a ship (most likely a trihemiolia), and represents the goddess as she descends from the skies to the triumphant fleet.
before she lost her arms, which have never been recovered, nike's right arm is believed to have been raised, cupped round her mouth to deliver the shout of victory.
the work is notable for its convincing rendering of a pose where violent motion and sudden stillness meet, for its graceful balance and for the rendering of the figure's draped garments, compellingly depicted as if rippling in a strong sea breeze.
similar traits can be seen in the laocoön group which is a reworked copy of a lost original that was likely close both in time and place of origin to nike, but while laocoön, vastly admired by renaissance and classicist artists, has come to be seen[by whom?]
as a more self-conscious and contrived work, nike of samothrace is seen as an iconic depiction of triumphant spirit and of the divine momentarily coming face to face with man.
the statue's outstretched right wing is a symmetric plaster version of the original left one.
the stylistic portrayal of the wings is a source of scholarly discussion, as the feather pattern resembles neither the wings of birds in nature nor wings in greek art.
as with the arms, the figure's head has never been found, but various other fragments have since been found: in 1950, a team led by karl lehmann unearthed the missing right hand of the louvre's winged victory.
the fingerless hand had slid out of sight under a large rock, near where the statue had originally stood; on the return trip home, dr phyllis williams lehmann identified the tip of the goddess's ring finger and her thumb in a storage drawer at the kunsthistorisches museum, vienna, where the second winged victory is displayed; the fragments have been reunited with the hand, which is now in a glass case in the louvre next to the podium on which the statue stands.
the different degree of finishing of the sides has led scholars to think that it was intended to be seen from three-quarters on the left.
a partial inscription on the base of the statue includes the word "rhodios" (rhodian), indicating that the statue was commissioned to celebrate a naval victory by rhodes, at that time the most powerful maritime state in the aegean which in itself would date the statue to 288 bc at the earliest.
[citation needed]
the sculptor is unknown, although paul mackendrick suggests that pythokritos of lindos is responsible.
when first discovered on the island of samothrace (then part of the ottoman empire and called semadirek) and published in 1863, it was suggested that the victory was erected by the macedonian general demetrius poliorcetes after his naval victory at cyprus, between 295 and 289 bc.
the archaeological museum of samothrace continues to follow these originally established provenance and dates.
ceramic evidence discovered in recent excavations has revealed that the pedestal was set up about 200 bc, though some scholars still date it as early as 250 bc or as late as 180. certainly, the parallels with figures and drapery from the pergamon altar (dated about 170 bc) seem strong.
the evidence for a rhodian commission of the statue has been questioned, however, and the closest artistic parallel to the nike of samothrace are figures depicted on macedonian coins.
samothrace was an important sanctuary for the hellenistic macedonian kings.
the most likely battle commemorated by this monument is, perhaps, the battle of cos in 255 bc, in which antigonus ii gonatas of macedonia won over the fleet of ptolemy ii of egypt.
in april 1863, the victory was discovered by the then french consul in adrianopolis and amateur archaeologist charles champoiseau (1830–1909), who sent it to paris in the same year.
the statue has been reassembled in stages since its discovery.
the prow was reconstructed from marble debris at the site by champoiseau in 1879 and assembled in situ before being shipped to paris.
after 1884, the statue was positioned where it would visually dominate the daru staircase.
since 1883, the marble figure has been displayed in the louvre, while a plaster replica stands at the original location of the sanctuary of the great gods on samothrace.
in the autumn of 1939, the winged victory was removed from her perch in anticipation of the outbreak of world war ii.
all the museums of paris were closed on august 25. artwork and objects were packed for removal to locations deemed safer outside paris for safekeeping.
on the night of september 3, the statue descended the staircase on a wooden ramp which was constructed across the steps.
during the years of world war ii, the statue was sheltered in safety in the château de valençay along with the venus de milo and michelangelo's slaves.
the discovery in the 1950s of the palm of the right hand and two fingers established that this hand was meant to show a simple gesture of statue and was not holding an object; the partial hand is stored next to the statue.
in 2013 a restoration effort was launched to improve the appearance of the sculpture.
this was the first detailed examination of the individual pieces of the sculpture to date.
the restoration aimed to restore the marble to its original hue which had been tarnished by time.
the sculpture was removed from its base and carried into an adjoining room which was transformed for the occasion into a restoration workshop.
the base was dismantled block by block and placed in the workshop.
scientific reviews were performed on the base (uv, infrared, x-ray spectroscopy) prior to cleaning the surface of the marble.
this effort aimed to respect the goals of the original restoration performed in 1883. the surface of the base was cleaned and then reassembled, and some gaps in the marble were repaired.
upon completion of the restoration, the statue was reunited with its base and returned to its prior position at the head of the daru staircase in the louvre.
despite its significant damage and incompleteness, the victory is held to be one of the great surviving masterpieces of sculpture from the hellenistic period, and from the entire greco-roman era.
the statue shows a mastery of form and movement which has impressed critics and artists since its discovery.
it is considered one of the louvre's greatest treasures, and since the late 19th century it has been displayed in the most dramatic fashion, at the head of the sweeping daru staircase.
the art historian h. w. janson has pointed out that unlike earlier greek or near eastern sculptures, nike creates a deliberate relationship to the imaginary space around the goddess.
the wind that has carried her and which she is fighting off, straining to keep steady – as mentioned the original mounting had her standing on a ship's prow, just having landed – is the invisible complement of the figure and the viewer is made to imagine it.
at the same time, this expanded space heightens the symbolic force of the work; the wind and the sea are suggested as metaphors of struggle, destiny and divine help or grace.
this kind of interplay between a statue and the space conjured up would become a common device in baroque and romantic art, about two thousand years later.
it is present in michelangelo's sculpture of david: david's gaze and pose shows where he is seeing his adversary goliath and his awareness of the moment – but it is rare in ancient art.
the victory soon became a cultural icon to which artists responded in many different ways.
for example, abbott handerson thayer's a virgin (1892–93) is a well-known painted allusion.
when filippo tommaso marinetti issued his futurist manifesto in 1909, he chose to contrast his movement with the supposedly defunct artistic sentiments of the winged victory: "a race-automobile which seems to rush over exploding powder is more beautiful than the 'victory of samothrace'".
the 1913 sculpture unique forms of continuity in space by the futuristic sculptor umberto boccioni, currently located at the museum of modern art (moma) in new york, was influenced by the statue, and is said to bear an underlying resemblance to it.
on february 3, 1999, according to the macedonian press agency: news in english, "residents of the aegean island of samothrace, the birthplace of the renowned greek sculpture nike of samothrace, aka the winged victory, embarked on a letter-writing campaign to have this finest extant of hellenistic sculpture returned to their homeland.in a letter signed by the island's mayor, the locals urged greek politicians to intervene and request that the louvre museum, where the statue is kept, acknowledge that the sculpture belongs in its natural environment."
the greek deputy minister of foreign affairs asked again for its return in 2013.

numerous copies exist in museums and galleries around the world; one of the best-known copies stands outside the caesars palace casino in las vegas.
the first fifa world cup trophy, commissioned in 1930 and designed by abel lafleur, was based on the model.
this statue was a favorite of architect frank lloyd wright and he used reproductions of it in a number of his buildings, including ward willits house, darwin d. martin house and storer house.
the largest public sculpture based on nike appears in a prominent position atop the massive pennsylvania state memorial at gettysburg national military park in pennsylvania.
philadelphia sculptor samuel murray, a student and intimate of painter thomas eakins, produced the 28-foot figure in 1911 with possible influence from augustus saint-gaudens' nike interpretation on the sherman memorial in new york city (1903).
saint-gaudens depicts nike with her right arm raised while it is thought the original nike was not making such gesture.
saint-gaudens' nike also wears a laurel wreath on her head and bears a large olive branch in her left hand.
murray adapted the laurel wreath and olive branch innovations but also placed a sword in nike's raised right hand.
starting in 1962, yves klein produced a series of plaster replicas of the nike coated in dry pigment of his signature international klein blue affixed by resin entitled victoire de samatrace.
swedish author gunnar ekelöf made nike a central image in his poem samothrace, written in 1941, where the faceless deity, arms outstretched like sails, is made into a symbol of the fight and the coming victory against nazism and the struggle for freedom throughout history.
it also features in the matthew reilly novel seven ancient wonders, where it is fictionally made part of the statue of zeus at olympia.
a full-size replica of the statue sits in the ohio state university's thompson library in columbus, ohio.
another full size replica stands in the lobby of crouse college, home to the setnor school of music, at syracuse university in syracuse, new york.
a 7-foot (2.1 m) replica of the sculpture stands at connecticut college in new london, connecticut.

buddhu's tomb (urdu: بدهو کا مقبره‎; "buddhū kā muqbara"), also known as buddhu kā āwā (urdu: بدهو کا آوا‎; "buddhu's kiln"), is a 17th-century tomb located in lahore, pakistan.
the tomb is traditionally attributed to that of a lahore resident named buddhu, though research suggests the tomb was actually built for the wife of khan-e-dauran bahadur nusrat jang.
some sikhs regard the tomb to be a gurdwara built by buddhu.
the tomb is located alongside the grand trunk road, east of the walled city of lahore.
the tomb is situated across the gt road from the university of engineering and technology.
the tomb was built around 1641, and is traditionally ascribed to be the tomb of buddhu, son of suddhu - a local brick maker who supplied bricks for several royal buildings in lahore during the shah jahan period.
historical record suggests that the tomb was actually built for the wife of khan-e-dauran bahadur nusrat jang - an amir of the mughal royal court.
the amir was himself was later buried in it following his death in 1643.
in keeping with mughal funerary tradition, the tomb was likely located in a garden which no longer survives.
the site was used by prince sher singh as his army's headquarters during his invasion of lahore.
the base level of the tomb is square shaped, and has an doorway in each side.
each doorway is flanked by a small recessed arch.
atop the base is an octagonal layer upon which the tomb's prominent dome is placed, measuring 32 feet in diameter.
the tomb is decorated with glazed blue and yellow tile-work, laid primarily in floral designs.
the tomb's dome is decorated with blue tile-work in a chevron pattern.
the tomb has traditionally be ascribed to be the brick-kiln of buddhu.
buddhu's servants are said to have refused abdul haq, a disciple of mian mir, from warming himself at the brick kiln.
haq cursed the kiln, leading to its eventual decline.
buddhu was forced to atone for his sin, but the insult was considered so great that the kiln remained out of service thereafter.
a sikh version of the legend asserts that buddhu had refused to feed bhai kamliya, and was later cursed by him until buddhu was able to repent to guru arjan before his business was restored.
sikhs assert that the tomb was actually built as part of a gurdwara.
the site is protected by the antiquities act 1975. the site was partially restored in 2014 by dr. abdul rehman, with support from an alumni fund for fulbright scholars, and the united states educational foundation in pakistan.
the monument is situated along the planned route of the orange line of the lahore metro.
heritage campaigners submitted a petition to the lahore high court as the planned metro line will pass close to buddhu's tomb, the shalimar gardens, and nine other sites in the city in violation of the punjab special premises ordinance, 1985 and antiquity act, 1975.
the tombs interior is decorated with calligraphy
the underside of the tomb was decorated with ghalib kari to create a 3-dimensional pattern
the tomb stands upon a small brick plinth
the chitta gate (urdu: چٹّا دروازه‎; "white gate") is a gateway located in the walled city of lahore, pakistan, dating from 1650. the gate was once the lahore's original "delhi gate," and the city's main entry-point.
the gate derived its current name from the white lime plaster which once covered its façade.
the gate is on the shahi guzargah ("royal passage") route that connects the lahore fort to the delhi gate.
the gate opens onto the wazir khan chowk and is situated between the elaborately decorated wazir khan mosque, and the shahi hammam.
the gateway is adjacent to the well of dina nath, and the shrine of syed sūf.
the gateway was built in 1650, during the reign of mughal emperor shah jahan.
the gate served as lahore's original delhi gate, but was replaced by the modern delhi gate, about 100 metres east of the current gateway.
the gate served as the main entry gate to lahore during the mughal era.

the interior of the gate is formed by a small chamber
the haveli of nau nihal singh (urdu/punjabi: نو نہال سنگھ حویلی) is a haveli mansion located in lahore, pakistan.
dating from the sikh era of the mid-19th century, the haveli is considered to be one of the finest examples of sikh architecture in lahore, and is the only sikh-era haveli that preserves its original ornamentation and architecture.
the haveli is located within the walled city of lahore, and is located near the mori gate in the southern half of the walled city.
the haveli is also near the bhatti gate and lohari gate.
the haveli was built around 1830 or 1840 for nau nihal singh, by his grandfather and founder of the sikh empire, maharaja ranjit singh.
the mansion was intended to be a personal residence for nau nihal singh.
the haveli has been used, since the british colonial era, to house the victoria girls' high school.
the base of the haveli is rectangular in shape, with its entrance on the western side.
the façade is divided into two sections, with the portion housing the haveli's entryway profusely decorated with frescoes painted in the vivid kangra style, and the other pierced with numerous windows.
a large jharoka balcony with sculpted brickwork and a small bulbous half dome is above the haveli's entry, which acted as a jharoka-e-darshan from which the maharaja could view his subjects gathered below.
the jharoka features 5 small arches, and is embellished imagery of winged humans, parrots, and frontally-viewed fish that are carved in a style which displays east asian influences.
the winged humans resemble both islamic descriptions of angels, but also reflect influences of the mythical hindu garuda.
the base of the dome is decorated with a serpent-like figure which echoes the hindu snake god naga.
the jharoka-e-darshan is flanked by two smaller jharokas.
each of the haveli's jharokas is decorated with a floral pedestal.
the building has four stories, and a basement level.
the fourth level is made of a small room known as rang mahal ("colour palace"), or alternatively as sheesh mahal ("mirror palace"), with large screens that form a space in which to catch breezes.
the remaining floors were built with high ceilings, to exaggerate the height of the structure in order to give the appearance of a citadel, rather than a private residence.
the ceilings of the haveli are made of decorated wood inlaid with glass and mirror, as well as sun-motifs in the central portion of the roof.
walls within the haveli are decorated with false arches that each contain a small 18 inch by 18 inch painting, with blues, golds, reds, and oranges dominating the haveli's colour palette.
the interior is also decorated with carved wood, brickwork, and floral frescoes.
the haveli features a large 2 storied inner courtyard which was also profusely decorated - the bottom level of which has since been whitewashed.
in front of the haveli is a small plaza known as maydan ka bhaiyan that was once used as the haveli's garden.
the haveli is protected by the antiquities act 1975.

the monument to sir alexander ball (maltese: il-monument ta' sir alexander ball) is a neoclassical monument in the lower barrakka gardens in valletta, malta.
it was built in 1810 as a memorial to sir alexander ball, a british admiral who was the first civil commissioner of malta.
attributed to the architect giorgio pullicino, the monument is in the form of an ancient greek temple.
sir alexander ball was a british naval officer who was sent to malta in 1798 to help the maltese rebels in the blockade against the french.
ball became the first civil commissioner of malta, a post he held from 1799 to 1801 and again from 1802 until his death on 25 october 1809. ball was widely loved and respected by the maltese people.
in december 1809, the maltese set up a committee of "deputies of the nation" and petitioned the acting commissioner francis chapman to build a monument dedicated to ball.
the lower barrakka gardens was chosen as the site to build the monument, since its location on the fortifications overlooking the grand harbour was appropriate to honour a naval officer, and it was an area popular with the local population.
the strategic location of the monument made it a powerful symbol of british rule in malta.
the monument was constructed in 1810, and its design is attributed to the maltese architect giorgio pullicino.
the monument was built using funds collected by the local population.
the monument deteriorated quickly after its construction since it is exposed to the elements.
in 1883, captain e. h. seymour formed a committee to restore it, and it was restored the following year by andrea vassallo under the supervision of emanuele luigi galizia.
the restored monument was inaugurated by governor sir lintorn simmons on 18 december 1884.
the monument was restored once again in 2001, as part of an overall restoration and rehabilitation of the lower barrakka.
the monument was designed in the greek revival style of neoclassical architecture.
it is built in the form of an ancient greek temple with a solid naos and a doric tetrastyle portico.
the design was inspired by the temple of hephaestus in athens, but the proportions are completely different since the monument is much smaller than the temple.
it is set on a high stylobate in order to make the structure more imposing.
each of the four walls of the naos contains a niche containing allegorical statues representing war, prudence, justice and immortality.
these statues are the work of the sculptor vincenzo dimech.
the frieze contains the following inscription:
alexandro ioan ball eq.
bar.melitensium pietaset suorum desideriumsimbolis privatis ob mer: p.p.
two identical inscriptions, one in latin and another in english, were installed at the base of the monument during the 1884 restoration.
the latin inscription reads:
monvmentvm hoccollatione popvliaedificatvma.d.
mdcccxpariqve modorestitvtvma.d.
mdccclxxxiv(meaning this monument, erected by public subscription a.d. 1810, was by the same means restored a.d. 1884)

jomo kenyatta[a] (c. 1897 – 22 august 1978) was a kenyan anti-colonial activist and politician who governed kenya as its prime minister from 1963 to 1964 and then as its first president from 1964 to his death in 1978. he was the country's first indigenous head of government and played a significant role in the transformation of kenya from a colony of the british empire into an independent republic.
ideologically an african nationalist and conservative, he led the kenya african national union (kanu) party from 1961 until his death.
kenyatta was born to kikuyu farmers in kiambu, british east africa.
educated at a mission school, he worked in various jobs before becoming politically engaged through the kikuyu central association.
in 1929, he travelled to london to lobby for kikuyu land affairs.
during the 1930s, he studied at moscow's communist university of the toilers of the east, university college london, and the london school of economics.
in 1938, he published an anthropological study of kikuyu life before working as a farm labourer in sussex during the second world war.
influenced by his friend george padmore, he embraced anti-colonialist and pan-african ideas, co-organising the 1945 pan-african congress in manchester.
he returned to kenya in 1946 and became a school principal.
in 1947, he was elected president of the kenya african union, through which he lobbied for independence from british colonial rule, attracting widespread indigenous support but animosity from white settlers.
in 1952, he was among the kapenguria six arrested and charged with masterminding the anti-colonial mau mau uprising.
although protesting his innocence—a view shared by later historians—he was convicted.
he remained imprisoned at lokitaung until 1959 and then exiled in lodwar until 1961.
on his release, kenyatta became president of kanu and led the party to victory in the 1963 general election.
as prime minister, he oversaw the transition of the kenya colony into an independent republic, of which he became president in 1964. desiring a one-party state, he transferred regional powers to his central government, suppressed political dissent, and prohibited kanu's only rival—oginga odinga's leftist kenya people's union—from competing in elections.
he promoted reconciliation between the country's indigenous ethnic groups and its european minority, although his relations with the kenyan indians were strained and kenya's army clashed with somali separatists in the north eastern province during the shifta war.
his government pursued capitalist economic policies and the "africanisation" of the economy, prohibiting non-citizens from controlling key industries.
education and healthcare were expanded, while uk-funded land redistribution favoured kanu loyalists and exacerbated ethnic tensions.
under kenyatta, kenya joined the organisation of african unity and the commonwealth of nations, espousing a pro-western and anti-communist foreign policy amid the cold war.
kenyatta died in office and was succeeded by daniel arap moi.
kenyatta was a controversial figure.
prior to kenyan independence, many of its white settlers regarded him as an agitator and malcontent, although across africa he gained widespread respect as an anti-colonialist.
during his presidency, he was given the honorary title of mzee and lauded as the father of the nation, securing support from both the black majority and the white minority with his message of reconciliation.
conversely, his rule was criticised as dictatorial, authoritarian, and neo-colonial, of favouring kikuyu over other ethnic groups, and of facilitating the growth of widespread corruption.
a member of the kikuyu people, kenyatta was born in the village of nginda.
birth records were not then kept among the kikuyu, and kenyatta's date of birth is not known.
one biographer, jules archer, suggested he was likely born in 1890, although a fuller analysis by jeremy murray-brown suggested a birth circa 1897 or 1898. kenyatta's father was named muigai, and his mother wambui.
they lived in a homestead near the river thiririka, where they raised crops and bred sheep and goats.
muigai was sufficiently wealthy that he could afford to keep several wives, each living in a separate nyūmba (woman's hut).
kenyatta was raised according to traditional kikuyu custom and belief, and was taught the skills needed to herd the family flock.
when he was ten, his earlobes were pierced to mark his transition from childhood.
wambui subsequently bore another son, kongo, shortly before muigai died.
in keeping with kikuyu tradition, wambui then married her late husband's younger brother, ngengi.
kenyatta then took the name of kamau wa ngengi ("kamau, son of ngengi").
wambui bore her new husband a son, whom they also named muigai.
ngengi was harsh and resentful toward the three boys, and wambui decided to take her youngest son to live with her parental family further north.
it was there that she died, and kenyatta—who was very fond of the younger muigai—travelled to collect his infant half-brother.
kenyatta then moved in with his grandfather, kongo wa magana, and assisted the latter in his role as a traditional healer.
— kenyatta, in a bbc interview, 1963
in november 1909, kenyatta left home and enrolled as a pupil at the church of scotland mission (csm) at thogoto.
the missionaries were zealous christians who believed that bringing christianity to the indigenous peoples of eastern africa was part of britain's civilising mission.
while there, kenyatta stayed at the small boarding school, where he learnt stories from the bible, and was taught to read and write in english.
he also performed chores for the mission, including washing the dishes and weeding the gardens.
he was soon joined at the mission dormitory by his brother kongo.
the longer the pupils stayed, the more they came to resent the patronising way many of the british missionaries treated them.
kenyatta's academic progress was unremarkable, and in july 1912 he became an apprentice to the mission's carpenter.
that year, he professed his dedication to christianity and began undergoing catechism.
in 1913, he underwent the kikuyu circumcision ritual; the missionaries generally disapproved of this custom, but it was an important aspect of kikuyu tradition, allowing kenyatta to be recognised as an adult.
asked to take a christian name for his upcoming baptism, he first chose both john and peter after jesus' apostles.
forced by the missionaries to choose just one, he chose johnstone, the -stone chosen as a reference to peter.
accordingly, he was baptised as johnstone kamau in august 1914. after his baptism, kenyatta moved out of the mission dormitory and lived with friends.
having completed his apprenticeship to the carpenter, kenyatta requested that the mission allow him to be an apprentice stonemason, but they refused.
he then requested that the mission recommend him for employment, but the head missionary refused because of an allegation of minor dishonesty.
kenyatta moved to thika, where he worked for an engineering firm run by briton john cook.
in this position, he was tasked with fetching the company wages from a bank in nairobi, 25 miles away.
kenyatta left the job when he became seriously ill; he recuperated at a friend's house in the tumutumu presbyterian mission.
at the time, the british empire was engaged in the first world war, and the british army had recruited many kikuyu.
one of those who joined was kongo, who disappeared during the conflict; his family never learned of his fate.
kenyatta did not join the armed forces, and like other kikuyu he moved to live among the maasai, who had refused to fight for the british.
kenyatta lived with the family of an aunt who had married a maasai chief, adopting maasai customs and wearing maasai jewellery, including a beaded belt known as kinyata in the kikuyu language.
at some point, he took to calling himself "kinyata" or "kenyatta" after this garment.
in 1917, kenyatta moved to narok, where he was involved in transporting livestock to nairobi, before relocating to nairobi to work in a store selling farming and engineering equipment.
in the evenings, he took classes in a church mission school.
several months later he returned to thika before obtaining employment building houses for the thogota mission.
he also lived for a time in dagoretti, where he became a retainer for a local sub-chief, kioi; in 1919 he assisted kioi in putting the latter's case in a land dispute before a nairobi court.
desiring a wife, kenyatta entered a relationship with grace wahu, who had attended the cms school in kabete; she initially moved into kenyatta's family homestead, although she joined kenyatta in dagoretti when ngengi drove her out.
on 20 november 1920 she gave birth to kenyatta's son, peter muigui.
in october 1920, kenyatta was called before the thogota kirk session and suspended from taking holy communion; the suspension was in response to his drinking and his relations with wahu out of wedlock.
the church insisted that a traditional kikuyu wedding would be inadequate, and that he must undergo a christian marriage; this took place on 8 november 1922. kenyatta had initially refused to cease drinking, but in july 1923 officially renounced alcohol and was allowed to return to holy communion.
in april 1922, kenyatta began working as a stores clerk and meter reader for cook, who had been appointed water superintendent for nairobi's municipal council.
he earned 250 shillings a month, a particularly high wage for a native african, which brought him financial independence and a growing sense of self-confidence.
kenyatta lived in the kilimani neighbourhood of nairobi, although financed the construction of a second home at dagoretti; he referred to this latter hut as the kinyata stores for he used it to hold general provisions for the neighbourhood.
he had sufficient funds that he could lend money to european clerks in the offices, and could enjoy the lifestyle offered by nairobi, which included cinemas, football matches, and imported british fashions.
anti-imperialist sentiment was on the rise among both native and indian communities in kenya following the irish war of independence and the russian october revolution.
many indigenous africans resented having to carry kipande identity certificates at all times, being forbidden from growing coffee, and paying taxes without political representation.
political upheavals occurred in kikuyuland—the area inhabited largely by the kikuyu—following world war i, among them the campaigns of harry thuku and the east african association, resulting in the government massacre of 21 native protesters in march 1922. kenyatta had not taken part in these events, perhaps so as not to disrupt his lucrative employment prospects.
kenyatta's interest in politics stemmed from his friendship with james beauttah, a senior figure in the kikuyu central association (kca).
beauttah took kenyatta to a political meeting in pumwani, although this led to no firm involvement at the time.
in either 1925 or early 1926, beauttah moved to uganda, although remained in contact with kenyatta.
when the kca wrote to beauttah and asked him to travel to london as their representative, he declined, but recommended that kenyatta—who had a good command of english—go in his place.
kenyatta accepted, probably on the condition that the association matched his pre-existing wage.
he thus became the group's secretary.
it is likely that the kca purchased a motorbike for kenyatta, which he used to travel around kikuyuland and neighbouring areas inhabited by the meru and embu, helping to establish new kca branches.
in february 1928, he was part of a kca party that visited government house in nairobi to give evidence in front of the hilton young commission, which was then considering a federation between kenya, uganda, and tanganyika.
in june, he was part of a kca team which appeared before a select committee of the kenyan legislative council to express concerns about the recent introduction of land boards.
introduced by the british governor of kenya, edward grigg, these land boards would hold all land in native reserves in trust for each tribal group.
both the kca and the kikuyu association opposed these land boards, which treated kikuyu land as collectively-owned rather than recognising individual kikuyu land ownership.
also in february, his daughter, wambui margaret, was born.
by this point he was increasingly using the name "kenyatta", which had a more african appearance than "johnstone".
in may 1928, the kca launched a kikuyu-language magazine, muĩgwithania (roughly translated as "the reconciler" or "the unifier"), in which it published news, articles, and homilies.
its purpose was to help unify the kikuyu and raise funds for the kca.
kenyatta was listed as the publication's editor, although murray-brown suggested that he was not the guiding hand behind it and that his duties were largely confined to translating into kikuyu.
aware that thuku had been exiled for his activism, kenyatta's took a cautious approach to campaigning, and in muĩgwithania he expressed support for the churches, district commissioners, and chiefs.
he also praised the british empire, stating that: "the first thing [about the empire] is that all people are governed justly, big or small – equally.
the second thing is that nobody is regarded as a slave, everyone is free to do what he or she likes without being hindered."
this did not prevent grigg from writing to the authorities in london requesting permission to shut the magazine down.
after the kca raised sufficient funds, in february 1929 kenyatta sailed from mombasa to britain.
grigg's administration could not stop kenyatta's journey but asked london's colonial office not to meet with him.
he initially stayed at the west african students' union premises in west london, where he met ladipo solanke.
he then lodged with a prostitute; both this and kenyatta's lavish spending brought concern from the church mission society.
his landlord subsequently impounded his belongings due to unpaid debt.
in the city, kenyatta met with w. mcgregor ross at the royal empire society, ross briefing him on how to deal with the colonial office.
kenyatta became friends with ross' family, and accompanied them to social events in hampstead.
he also contacted anti-imperialists active in britain, including the league against imperialism, fenner brockway, and kingsley martin.
grigg was in london at the same time and, despite his opposition to kenyatta's visit, agreed to meet with him at the rhodes trust headquarters in april.
at the meeting, kenyatta raised the land issue and thuku's exile, the atmosphere between the two being friendly.
in spite of this, following the meeting, grigg convinced special branch to monitor kenyatta.
kenyatta developed contacts with radicals to the left of the labour party, including several communists.
in the summer of 1929, he left london and travelled by berlin to moscow before returning to london in october.
kenyatta was strongly influenced by his time in the soviet union.
back in england, he wrote three articles on the kenyan situation for the communist party of great britain's newspapers, the daily worker and sunday worker.
in these, his criticism of british imperialism was far stronger than it had been in muĩgwithania.
these communist links concerned many of kenyatta's liberal patrons.
in january, kenyatta met with drummond shiels, the under-secretary of state for the colonies, at the house of commons.
kenyatta told shiels that he was not affiliated with communist circles and was unaware of the nature of the newspaper which published his articles.
shiels advised kenyatta to return home to promote kikuyu involvement in the constitutional process and discourage violence and extremism.
after eighteen months in europe, kenyatta had run out of money.
the anti-slavery society advanced him funds to pay off his debts and return to kenya.
although kenyatta enjoyed life in london and feared arrest if he returned home, he sailed back to mombasa in september 1930. on his return, his prestige among the kikuyu was high because of his time spent in europe.
in his absence, female genital mutilation (fgm) had become a topic of strong debate in kikuyu society.
the protestant churches, backed by european medics and the colonial authorities, supported the abolition of this traditional practice, but the kca rallied to its defence, claiming that its abolition would damage the structure of kikuyu society.
anger between the two sides had heightened, several churches expelling kca members from their congregations, and it was widely believed that the january 1930 killing of an american missionary, hulda stumpf, had been due to the issue.
as secretary of the kca, kenyatta met with church representatives.
he expressed the view that although personally opposing fgm, he regarded its legal abolition as counter-productive, and argued that the churches should focus on eradicating the practice through educating people about its harmful effects on women's health.
the meeting ended without compromise, and john arthur—the head of the church of scotland in kenya—later expelled kenyatta from the church, citing what he deemed dishonesty during the debate.
in 1931, kenyatta took his son out of the church school at thogota and enrolled him in a kca-approved, independent school.
— kenyatta in the labour monthly, november 1933
in may 1931, kenyatta and parmenas mockerie sailed for britain, intent on representing the kca at a joint committee of parliament on the future of east africa.
kenyatta would not return to kenya for fifteen years.
in britain, he spent the summer attending an independent labour party summer school and fabian society gatherings.
in june, he visited geneva, switzerland to attend a save the children conference on african children.
in november, he met the indian independence leader mohandas gandhi while in london.
that month, he enrolled in the woodbrooke quaker college in birmingham, where he remained until the spring of 1932, attaining a certificate in english writing.
in britain, kenyatta befriended an afro-caribbean marxist, george padmore, who was working for the soviet-run comintern.
over time, he became padmore's protégé.
in late 1932, he joined padmore in germany.
before the end of the year, the duo relocated to moscow, where kenyatta studied at the communist university of the toilers of the east.
there he was taught arithmetic, geography, natural science, and political economy, as well as marxist-leninist doctrine and the history of the marxist-leninist movement.
many africans and members of the african diaspora were attracted to the institution because it offered free education and the opportunity to study in an environment where they were treated with dignity, free from the institutionalised racism present in the u.s. and british empire.
kenyatta complained about the food, accommodation, and poor quality of english instruction.
there is no evidence that he joined the communist party of the soviet union, and one of his fellow students later characterised him as "the biggest reactionary i have ever met."
kenyatta also visited siberia, probably as part of an official guided tour.
the emergence of germany's nazi government shifted political allegiances in europe; the soviet union pursued formal alliances with france and czechoslovakia, and thus reduced its support for the movement against british and french colonial rule in africa.
as a result, comintern disbanded the international trade union committee of negro workers, with which both padmore and kenyatta were affiliated.
padmore resigned from the soviet communist party in protest, and was subsequently vilified in the soviet press.
both padmore and kenyatta left the soviet union, the latter returning to london in august 1933. the british authorities were highly suspicious of kenyatta's time in the soviet union, suspecting that he was a marxist-leninist, and following his return the mi5 intelligence service intercepted and read all his mail.
kenyatta continued writing articles, reflecting padmore's influence.
between 1931 and 1937 he wrote several articles for the negro worker and joined the newspaper's editorial board in 1933. he also produced an article for a november 1933 issue of labour monthly, and in may 1934 had a letter published in the manchester guardian.
he also wrote the entry on kenya for negro, an anthology edited by nancy cunard and published in 1934. in these, he took a more radical position than he had in the past, calling for complete self-rule in kenya.
in doing so he was virtually alone among political kenyans; figures like thuku and jesse kariuki were far more moderate in their demands.
the pro-independence sentiments that he was able to express in britain would not have been permitted in kenya itself.
between 1935 and 1937, kenyatta worked as a linguistic informant for the phonetics department at university college london (ucl); his kikuyu voice recordings assisted lilias armstrong's production of the phonetic and tonal structure of kikuyu.
the book was published under armstrong's name, although kenyatta claimed he should have been listed as co-author.
he enrolled at ucl as a student, studying an english course between january and july 1935 and then a phonetics course from october 1935 to june 1936. enabled by a grant from the international african institute, he also took a social anthropology course under bronisław malinowski at the london school of economics (lse).
kenyatta lacked the qualifications normally required to join the course, but malinowski was keen to support the participation of indigenous peoples in anthropological research.
for kenyatta, acquiring an advanced degree would bolster his status among kenyans and display his intellectual equality with white europeans.over the course of his studies, kenyatta and malinowski became close friends.
fellow course-mates included the anthropologists audrey richards, lucy mair, and elspeth huxley.
another of his fellow lse students was prince peter of greece and denmark, who invited kenyatta to stay with him and his mother, princess marie bonaparte, in paris during the spring of 1936.
kenyatta returned to his former dwellings at 95 cambridge street, but did not pay his landlady for over a year, owing over £100 in rent.
this angered ross and contributed to the breakdown of their friendship.
he then rented a camden town flat with his friend dinah snock, whom he met at an anti-imperialist rally in trafalgar square.
kenyatta socialised at the student movement house in russell square, which he had joined in the spring of 1934, and befriended africans in the city.
to earn money, he worked as one of 250 black extras in the film sanders of the river, filmed at shepperton studios in autumn 1934. several other africans in london criticised him for doing so, arguing that the film degraded black people.
appearing in the film also allowed him to meet and befriend its star, the african-american paul robeson.
in 1935, italy invaded ethiopia (abyssinia), incensing kenyatta and other africans in london; he became the honorary secretary of the international african friends of abyssinia, a group established by padmore and c. l. r. james.
when ethiopia's monarch haile selassie fled to london in exile, kenyatta personally welcomed him at waterloo station.
this group developed into a wider pan-africanist organisation, the international african service bureau (iasb), of which kenyatta became one of the vice chairs.
kenyatta began giving anti-colonial lectures across britain for groups like the iasb, the workers' educational association, indian national congress of great britain, and the league of coloured peoples.
in october 1938, he gave a talk to the manchester fabian society in which he described british colonial policy as fascism and compared the treatment of indigenous people in east africa to the treatment of jews in nazi germany.
in response to these activities, the british colonial office reopened their file on him, although could not find any evidence that he was engaged in anything sufficiently seditious to warrant prosecution.
kenyatta assembled the essays on kikuyu society written for malinowski's class and published them as facing mount kenya in 1938. featuring an introduction written by malinowski, the book reflected kenyatta's desire to use anthropology as a weapon against colonialism.
in it, kenyatta challenged the eurocentric view of history by presenting an image of a golden african past by emphasising the perceived order, virtue, and self-sufficiency of kikuyu society.
utilising a functionalist framework, he promoted the idea that traditional kikuyu society had a cohesion and integrity that was better than anything offered by european colonialism.
in this book, kenyatta made clear his belief that the rights of the individual should be downgraded in favour of the interests of the group.
the book also reflected his changing views on female genital mutilation; where once he opposed it, he now unequivocally supported the practice, downplaying the medical dangers that it posed to women.
the book's jacket cover featured an image of kenyatta in traditional dress, wearing a skin cloak over one shoulder and carrying a spear.
the book was published under the name "jomo kenyatta", the first time that he had done so; the term jomo was close to a kikuyu word describing the removal of a sword from its scabbard.
facing mount kenya was a commercial failure, selling only 517 copies, but was generally well received; an exception was among white kenyans, whose assumptions about the kikuyu being primitive savages in need of european civilisation it challenged.
murray-brown later described it as "a propaganda tour de force.
no other african had made such an uncompromising stand for tribal integrity."
bodil folke frederiksen, a scholar of development studies, referred to it as "probably the most well-known and influential african scholarly work of its time", while for fellow scholar simon gikandi, it was "one of the major texts in what has come to be known as the invention of tradition in colonial africa".
— kenyatta, during world war ii
after the united kingdom entered world war ii in september 1939, kenyatta and stock moved to the sussex village of storrington.
kenyatta remained there for the duration of the war, renting a flat and a small plot of land to grow vegetables and raise chickens.
he settled into rural sussex life, and became a regular at the village pub, where he gained the nickname "jumbo".
in august 1940, he took a job at a local farm as an agricultural worker—allowing him to evade military conscription—before working in the tomato greenhouses at lindfield.
he attempted to join the local home guard, but was turned down.
on 11 may 1942 he married an english woman, edna grace clarke, at chanctonbury registry office.
in august 1943, their son, peter magana, was born.
intelligence services continued monitoring kenyatta, noting that he was politically inactive between 1939 and 1944. in sussex, he wrote an essay for the united society for christian literature, my people of kikuyu and the life of chief wangombe, in which he called for his tribe's political independence.
he also began—although never finished—a novel partly based on his life experiences.
he continued to give lectures around the country, including to groups of east african soldiers stationed in britain.
he became frustrated by the distance between him and kenya, telling edna that he felt "like a general separated by 5000 miles from his troops".
while he was absent, kenya's authorities banned the kca in 1940.
kenyatta and other senior iasb members began planning the fifth pan-african congress, held in manchester in october 1945. they were assisted by kwame nkrumah, a gold coast (ghanaian) who arrived in britain earlier that year.
kenyatta spoke at the conference, although made no particular impact on the proceedings.
much of the debate that took place centred on whether indigenous africans should continue pursuing a gradual campaign for independence or whether they should seek the military overthrow of the european imperialists.
the conference ended with a statement declaring that while delegates desired a peaceful transition to african self-rule, africans "as a last resort, may have to appeal to force in the effort to achieve freedom".
kenyatta supported this resolution, although was more cautious than other delegates and made no open commitment to violence.
he subsequently authored an iasb pamphlet, kenya: the land of conflict, in which he blended political calls for independence with romanticised descriptions of an idealised pre-colonial african past.
after british victory in world war ii, kenyatta received a request to return to kenya in september 1946, sailing back that month.
he decided not to bring edna—who was pregnant with a second child—with him, aware that if they joined him in kenya their lives would be made very difficult by the colony's racial laws.
on his arrival in mombasa, kenyatta was greeted by his first wife and their children.
he built a bungalow at gatundu, near to where he was born, and began farming his 32-acre estate.
kenyatta met with the new governor of kenya, philip euen mitchell, and in march 1947 accepted a post on an african land settlement board, holding the post for two years.
he also met with mbiyu koinange to discuss the future of the koinange independent teachers' college in githungui, koinange appointing kenyatta as its vice-principal.
in may 1947, koinange moved to england, leaving kenyatta to take full control of the college.
under kenyatta's leadership, additional funds were raised for the construction of school buildings and the number of boys in attendance rose from 250 to 900. it was also beset with problems, including a decline in standards and teachers' strikes over non-payment of wages.
gradually, the number of enrolled pupils fell.
kenyatta built a friendship with koinange's father, a senior chief, who gave kenyatta one of his daughters to take as his third wife.she bore him another child, but later died in childbirth.
in 1951, he married his fourth wife, ngina, who was one of the few female students at his college; she then gave birth to a daughter.
in august 1944, the kenya african union (kau) had been founded; at that time it was the only active political outlet for indigenous africans in the colony.
at its june 1947 annual general meeting, kau's president james gichuru stepped down and kenyatta was elected as his replacement.
kenyatta began to draw large crowds wherever he travelled in kikuyuland, and kikuyu press began describing him as the "saviour", "great elder", and "hero of our race".
he was nevertheless aware that to achieve independence, kau needed the support of other indigenous tribes and ethnic groups.
this was made difficult by the fact that many maasai and luo—tribes traditionally hostile to the kikuyu—regarded him as an advocate of kikuyu dominance.
he insisted on intertribal representation on the kau executive and ensured that party business was conducted in swahili, the lingua franca of indigenous kenyans.
to attract support from kenya's indian community, he made contact with jawaharlal nehru, the first prime minister of the new indian republic.
nehru's response was supportive, sending a message to kenya's indian minority reminding them that they were the guests of the indigenous african population.
relations with the white minority remained strained; for most white kenyans, kenyatta was their principal enemy, an agitator with links to the soviet union who had the impertinence to marry a white woman.
they too increasingly called for further kenyan autonomy from the british government, but wanted continued white-minority rule and closer links to the white-minority governments of south africa, northern rhodesia, and southern rhodesia; they viewed britain's newly elected labour government with great suspicion.
the white electors' union put forward a "kenya plan" which proposed greater white settlement in kenya, bringing tanganyika into the british empire, and incorporating it within their new british east african dominion.
in april 1950, kenyatta was present at a joint meeting of kau and the east african indian national congress in which they both expressed opposition to the kenya plan.
by 1952, kenyatta was widely recognised as a national leader, both by his supporters and by his opponents.
as kau leader, he was at pains to oppose all illegal activity, including workers' strikes.
he called on his supporters to work hard, and to abandon laziness, theft, and crime.
he also insisted that in an independent kenya, all racial groups would be safeguarded.
kenyatta's gradualist and peaceful approach contrasted with the growth of the mau mau uprising, as armed guerrilla groups began targeting the white minority and members of the kikuyu community who did not support them.
by 1959, the mau mau had killed around 1,880 people.
for many young mau mau militants, kenyatta was regarded as a hero, and they included his name in the oaths they gave to the organisation; such oathing was a kikuyu custom by which individuals pledged allegiance to another.
kenyatta publicly distanced himself from the mau mau.
in april 1952, he began a speaking tour in which he denounced the mau mau to assembled crowds, insisting that independence must be achieved through peaceful means.
in august he attended a much-publicised mass meeting in kiambu where—in front of 30,000 people—he said that "mau mau has spoiled the country.
let mau mau perish forever.
all people should search for mau mau and kill it."
despite kenyatta's vocal opposition to the mau mau, kau had moved towards a position of greater militancy.
at its 1951 agm, more militant african nationalists had taken senior positions and the party officially announced its call for kenyan independence within three years.
in january 1952, kau members formed a secret central committee devoted to direct action, formulated along a cell structure.
whatever kenyatta's views on these developments, he had little ability to control them.
he was increasingly frustrated, and—without the intellectual companionship he experienced in britain—felt lonely.
— kenyatta, quoted by the daily express, september 1952
in october 1952, kenyatta was arrested and driven to nairobi, where he was taken aboard a plane and flown to lokitaung, northwest kenya, one of the most remote locations in the country.
from there he wrote to his family to let them know of his situation.
kenya's authorities believed that detaining kenyatta would help quell civil unrest.
many white settlers wanted him exiled, but the government feared this would turn him into a martyr for the anti-colonialist cause.
they thought it better that he be convicted and imprisoned, although at the time had nothing to charge him with, and so began searching his personal files for evidence of criminal activity.
eventually, they charged him and five senior kau members with masterminding the mau mau, a proscribed group.
the historian john m. lonsdale stated that kenyatta had been made a "scapegoat", while the historian a. b. assensoh later suggested that the authorities "knew very well" that kenyatta was not involved in the mau mau, but that they were nevertheless committed to silencing his calls for independence.
the trial took place in kapenguria, a remote area near the ugandan border that the authorities hoped would not attract crowds or attention.
together, kenyatta, bildad kaggia, fred kubai, paul ngei, achieng oneko and kung'u karumba—the "kapenguria six"—were put on trial.
the defendants assembled an international and multiracial team of defence lawyers, including chaman lall, h. o. davies, f. r. s. de souza, and dudley thompson, led by british barrister and member of parliament denis nowell pritt.
pritt's involvement brought much media attention; during the trial he faced government harassment and was sent death threats.
the judge selected, ransley thacker, had recently retired from the supreme court of kenya; the government knew he would be sympathetic to their case and gave him £20,000 to oversee it.
the trial lasted five months: rawson macharia, the main prosecution witness, turned out to have perjured himself; the judge had only recently been awarded an unusually large pension and maintained secret contact with the then colonial governor evelyn baring.
the prosecution failed to produce any strong evidence that kenyatta or the other accused had any involvement in managing the mau mau.
in april 1953, judge thacker found the defendants guilty.
he sentenced them to seven years' hard labour, to be followed by indefinite restriction preventing them from leaving a given area without permission.
in addressing the court, kenyatta stated that he and the others did not recognise the judge's findings; they claimed that the government had used them as scapegoats as a pretext to shut down kau.
the historian wunyabari o. maloba later characterised it as "a rigged political trial with a predetermined outcome".
the government followed the verdict with a wider crackdown, banning kau in june 1953, and closing down most of the independent schools in the country, including kenyatta's.
it appropriated his land at gatundu and demolished his house.
kenyatta and the others were returned to lokitaung, where they resided on remand while awaiting the results of the appeal process.
pritt pointed out that thacker had been appointed magistrate for the wrong district, a technicality voiding the whole trial; the supreme court of kenya concurred and kenyatta and the others were freed in july 1953, only to be immediately re-arrested.
the government took the case to the east african court of appeal, which reversed the supreme court's decision in august.
the appeals process resumed in october 1953, and in january 1954 the supreme court upheld the convictions against all but oneko.
pritt finally took the case to the privy council in london, but they refused his petition without providing an explanation.
he later noted that this was despite the fact his case was one of the strongest he had ever presented during his career.
according to murray-brown, it is likely that political, rather than legal considerations, informed their decision to reject the case.
during the appeal process, a prison had been built at lokitaung, where kenyatta and the four others were then interned.
the others were made to break rocks in the hot sun but kenyatta, because of his age, was instead appointed their cook, preparing a daily diet of beans and posho.
in 1955, p. de robeck became the district officer, after which kenyatta and the other inmates were treated more leniently.
in april 1954, they had been joined by a captured mau mau commander, waruhiu itote; kenyatta befriended him, and gave him english lessons.
by 1957, the inmates had formed into two rival cliques, with kenyatta and itote on one side and the other kau members—now calling themselves the "national democratic party"—on the other.
in one incident, one of his rivals made an unsuccessful attempt to stab kenyatta at breakfast.
kenyatta's health had deteriorated in prison; manacles had caused problems for his feet and he had eczema across his body.
kenyatta's imprisonment transformed him into a political martyr for many kenyans, further enhancing his status.
a luo anti-colonial activist, jaramogi oginga odinga, was the first to publicly call for kenyatta's release, an issue that gained growing support among kenya's anti-colonialists.
in 1955, the british writer montagu slater—a socialist sympathetic to kenyatta's plight—released the trial of jomo kenyatta, a book which raised the profile of the case.
in 1958, rawson macharia, the key witness in the state's prosecution of kenyatta, signed an affidavit swearing that his evidence against kenyatta had been false; this was widely publicised.
by the late 1950s, the imprisoned kenyatta had become a symbol of african nationalism across the continent.
his sentence served, in april 1959 kenyatta was released from lokitaung.
the administration then placed a restricting order on kenyatta, forcing him to reside in the remote area of lodwar, where he had to report to the district commissioner twice a day.
there, he was joined by his wife ngina.
in october 1961 she bore him another son, uhuru, and later on another daughter, nyokabi, and a further son, muhoho.
kenyatta spent two years in lodwar.
the governor of kenya, patrick muir renison, insisted that it was necessary; in a march 1961 speech, he described kenyatta an "african leader to darkness and death" and stated that if he were released, violence would erupt.
this indefinite detention was widely interpreted internationally as a reflection of the cruelties of british imperialism.
calls for his release came from the chinese government, india's nehru, and tanganyika's prime minister julius nyerere.
kwame nkrumah—whom kenyatta had known since the 1940s and who was now president of a newly independent ghana—personally raised the issue with british prime minister harold macmillan and other uk officials, with the ghanaian government offering kenyatta asylum in the event of his release.
resolutions calling for his release were produced at the all-african peoples' conferences held in tunis in 1960 and cairo in 1961. internal calls for his release came from kenyan asian activists in the kenya indian congress, while a colonial government commissioned poll revealed that most of kenya's indigenous africans wanted this outcome.
by this point, it was widely accepted that kenyan independence was inevitable, the british empire having been dismantled throughout much of asia and macmillan having made his "wind of change" speech.
in january 1960, the british government made its intention to free kenya apparent.
it invited representatives of kenya's anti-colonial movement to discuss the transition at london's lancaster house.
an agreement was reached that an election would be called for a new 65-seat legislative council, with 33 seats reserved for black africans, 20 for other ethnic groups, and 12 as 'national members' elected by a pan-racial electorate.
it was clear to all concerned that kenyatta was going to be the key to the future of kenyan politics.
after the lancaster house negotiations, the anti-colonial movement had split into two parties, the kenya african national union (kanu), which was dominated by kikuyu and luo, and the kenya african democratic union (kadu), which was led largely by members of smaller ethnic groups like the kalenjin and maasai.
in may 1960, kanu nominated kenyatta as its president, although the government vetoed it, insisting that he had been an instigator of the mau mau.
kanu then declared that it would refuse to take part in any government unless kenyatta was freed.
kanu campaigned on the issue of kenyatta's detainment in the february 1961 election, where it gained a majority of votes.
kanu nevertheless refused to form a government, which was instead created through a kadu-led coalition of smaller parties.
kenyatta had kept abreast of these developments, although he had refused to back either kanu or kadu, instead insisting on unity between the two parties.
renison decided to release kenyatta before kenya achieved independence.
he thought public exposure to kenyatta prior to elections would make the populace less likely to vote for a man renison regarded as a violent extremist.
in april 1961, the government flew kenyatta to maralal, where he maintained his innocence of the charges but told reporters that he bore no grudges.
he reiterated that he had never supported violence or the illegal oathing system used by the mau mau, and denied having ever been a marxist, stating: "i shall always remain an african nationalist to the end".
in august, he was moved to gatundu in kikuyuland, where he was greeted by a crowd of 10,000. there, the colonial government had built him a new house to replace that they had demolished.
now a free man, he travelled to cities like nairobi and mombasa to make public appearances.after his release, kenyatta set about trying to ensure that he was the only realistic option as kenya's future leader.
in august he met with renison at kiambu, and was interviewed by the bbc's face to face.
in october 1961, kenyatta formally joined kanu and accepted its presidency.
in january 1962 he was elected unopposed as kanu's representative for the fort hall constituency in the legislative council after its sitting member, kariuki njiiri, resigned.
kenyatta travelled elsewhere in africa, visiting tanganyika in october 1961 and ethiopia in november at the invitation of their governments.
a key issue facing kenya was a border dispute in north east province, alongside somalia.
ethnic somalis inhabited this region and claimed it should be part of somalia, not kenya.
kenyatta disagreed, insisting the land remain kenyan.
in june 1962, kenyatta travelled to mogadishu to discuss the issue with the somalian authorities, but the two sides could not reach an agreement.
kenyatta sought to gain the confidence of the white settler community.
in 1962, the white minority had produced 80% of the country's exports and were a vital part of its economy, yet between 1962 and 1963 they were emigrating at a rate of 700 a month; kenyatta feared that this white exodus would cause a brain drain and skills shortage that would be detrimental to the economy.
he was also aware that the confidence of the white minority would be crucial to securing western investment in kenya's economy.
kenyatta made it clear that when in power, he would not sack any white civil servants unless there were competent black individuals capable of replacing them.
he was sufficiently successful that several prominent white kenyans backed kanu in the subsequent election.
in 1962 he returned to london to attend one of the lancaster house conferences.
there, kanu and kadu representatives met with british officials to formulate a new constitution.
kadu desired a federalist state organised on a system they called majimbo with six largely autonomous regional authorities, a two-chamber legislature, and a central federal council of ministers who would select a rotating chair to serve as head of government for a one-year term.
renison's administration and most white settlers favoured this system as it would prevent a strong central government implementing radical reform.
kanu opposed majimbo, believing that it served entrenched interests and denied equal opportunities across kenya; they also insisted on an elected head of government.
at kenyatta's prompting, kanu conceded to some of kadu's demands; he was aware that he could amend the constitution when in office.
the new constitution divided kenya into six regions, each with a regional assembly, but also featured a strong central government and both an upper and a lower house.
it was agreed that a temporary coalition government would be established until independence, several kanu politicians being given ministerial posts.
kenyatta accepted a minor position, that of the minister of state for constitutional affairs and economic planning.
the british government considered renison too ill at ease with indigenous africans to oversee the transition to independence and thus replaced him with malcolm macdonald as governor of kenya in january 1963. macdonald and kenyatta developed a strong friendship; the briton referred to the latter as "the wisest and perhaps strongest as well as most popular potential prime minister of the independent nation to be".
macdonald sped up plans for kenyan independence, believing that the longer the wait, the greater the opportunity for radicalisation among african nationalists.
an election was scheduled for may, with self-government in june, followed by full independence in december.
the may 1963 general election pitted kenyatta's kanu against kadu, the akamba people's party, and various independent candidates.
kanu was victorious with 83 seats out of 124 in the house of representatives; a kanu majority government replaced the pre-existing coalition.
on 1 june 1963, kenyatta was sworn in as prime minister of the autonomous kenyan government.
kenya remained a monarchy, with queen elizabeth ii as its head of state.
in november 1963, kenyatta's government introduced a law making it a criminal offence to disrespect the prime minister, exile being the punishment.
kenyatta's personality became a central aspect of the creation of the new state.
in december, nairobi's delamere avenue was renamed kenyatta avenue, and a bronze statue of him was erected beside the country's national assembly.
photographs of kenyatta were widely displayed in shop windows, and his face was also printed on the new currency.
in 1964, oxford university press published a collection of kenyatta's speeches under the title of harambee!.
kenya's first cabinet included not only kikuyu but also members of the luo, kamba, kisii, and maragoli tribal groups.in june 1963, kenyatta met with julius nyerere and ugandan president milton obote in nairobi.
the trio discussed the possibility of merging their three nations (plus zanzibar) into a single east african federation, agreeing that this would be accomplished by the end of the year.
privately, kenyatta was more reluctant regarding the arrangement and as 1964 came around the federation had not come to pass.
many radical voices in kenya urged him to pursue the project; in may 1964, kenyatta rejected a back-benchers resolution calling for speedier federation.
he publicly stated that talk of a federation had always been a ruse to hasten the pace of kenyan independence from britain, but nyerere denied that this was true.
continuing to emphasise good relations with the white settlers, in august 1963 kenyatta met with 300 white farmers at nakuru.
he reassured them that they would be safe and welcome in an independent kenya, and more broadly talked of forgiving and forgetting the conflicts of the past.
despite his attempts at wooing white support, he did not do the same with the indian minority.
like many indigenous africans in kenya, kenyatta bore a sense of resentment towards this community, despite the role that many indians had played in securing the country's independence.
he also encouraged the remaining mau mau fighters to leave the forests and settle in society.
throughout kenyatta's rule, many of these individuals remained out of work, unemployment being one of the most persistent problems facing his government.
a celebration to mark independence was held in a specially constructed stadium on 12 december 1963. during the ceremony, prince philip, duke of edinburgh—representing the british monarchy—formally handed over control of the country to kenyatta.
also in attendance were leading figures from the mau mau.
in a speech, kenyatta described it as "the greatest day in kenya's history and the happiest day in my life."
he had flown edna and peter over for the ceremony, and in kenya they were welcomed into kenyatta's family by his other wives.
disputes with somalia over the northern frontier district (nfd) continued; for much of kenyatta's rule, somalia remained the major threat to his government.
to deal with sporadic violence in the region by somali shifta guerrillas, kenyatta sent soldiers into the region in december 1963 and gave them broad powers of arrest and seizure in the nfd in september 1964. british troops were assigned to assist the kenyan army in the region.
kenyatta also faced domestic opposition: in january 1964, sections of the army launched a mutiny in nairobi, and kenyatta called on the british army to put down the rebellion.
similar armed uprisings had taken place that month in neighbouring uganda and tanganyika.
kenyatta was outraged and shaken by the mutiny.
he publicly rebuked the mutineers, emphasising the need for law and order in kenya.
to prevent further military unrest, he brought in a review of the salaries of the army, police, and prison staff, leading to pay rises.
kenyatta also wanted to contain parliamentary opposition and at kenyatta's prompting, in november 1964 kadu officially dissolved and its representatives joined kanu.
two of the senior members of kadu, ronald ngala and daniel arap moi, subsequently became some of kenyatta's most loyal supporters.
kenya therefore became a de facto one-party state.
in december 1964, kenya was officially proclaimed a republic.
kenyatta became its executive president, combining the roles of head of state and head of government.
over the course of 1965 and 1966, several constitutional amendments enhanced the president's power.
for instance, a may 1966 amendment gave the president the ability to order the detention of individuals without trial if he thought the security of the state was threatened.
seeking the support of kenya's second largest ethnic group, the luo, kenyatta appointed the luo oginga odinga as his vice president.
the kikuyu—who made up around 20 percent of population—still held most of the country's important government and administrative positions.
this contributed to a perception among many kenyans that independence had simply seen the dominance of a british elite replaced by the dominance of a kikuyu elite.
kenyatta's calls to forgive and forget the past were a keystone of his government.
he preserved some elements of the old colonial order, particularly in relation to law and order.
the police and military structures were left largely intact.
white kenyans were left in senior positions within the judiciary, civil service, and parliament, with the white kenyans bruce mackenzie and humphrey slade being among kenyatta's top officials.
kenyatta's government nevertheless rejected the idea that the european and asian minorities could be permitted dual citizenship, expecting these communities to offer total loyalty to the independent kenyan state.
his administration pressured whites-only social clubs to adopt multi-racial entry policies, and in 1964 schools formerly reserved for european pupils were opened to africans and asians.
kenyatta's government believed it necessary to cultivate a united kenyan national culture.
to this end, it made efforts to assert the dignity of indigenous african cultures which missionaries and colonial authorities had belittled as "primitive".
an east african literature bureau was created to publish the work of indigenous writers.
the kenya cultural centre supported indigenous art and music, and hundreds of traditional music and dance groups were formed; kenyatta personally insisted that such performances were held at all national celebrations.
support was given to the preservation of historic and cultural monuments, while street names referencing colonial figures were renamed and symbols of colonialism—like the statue of british settler hugh cholmondeley, 3rd baron delamere in nairobi city centre—were removed.
the government encouraged the use of swahili as a national language, although english remained the main medium for parliamentary debates and the language of instruction in schools and universities.
the historian robert m. maxon nevertheless suggested that "no national culture emerged during the kenyatta era", most artistic and cultural expressions reflecting particular ethnic groups rather than a broader sense of kenyanness, while western culture remained heavily influential over the country's elites.
independent kenya had an economy heavily moulded by colonial rule; agriculture dominated while industry was limited, and there was a heavy reliance on exporting primary goods while importing capital and manufactured goods.
under kenyatta, the structure of this economy did not fundamentally change, remaining externally oriented and dominated by multinational corporations and foreign capital.
kenyatta's economic policy was capitalist and entrepreneurial, with no serious socialist policies being pursued; its focus was on achieving economic growth as opposed to equitable redistribution.
the government passed laws to encourage foreign investment, recognising that kenya needed foreign-trained specialists in scientific and technical fields to aid its economic development.
under kenyatta, western companies regarded kenya as a safe and profitable place for investment; between 1964 and 1970, large-scale foreign investment and industry in kenya nearly doubled.
in contrast to his economic policies, kenyatta publicly claimed he would create a democratic socialist state with an equitable distribution of economic and social development.
in 1965, when thomas mboya was minister for economic planning and development, the government issued a session paper titled "african socialism and its application to planning in kenya", in which it officially declared its commitment to what it called an "african socialist" economic model.
the session proposed a mixed economy with an important role for private capital, with kenyatta's government specifying that it would consider only nationalisation in instances where national security was at risk.
left-wing critics highlighted that the image of "african socialism" portrayed in the document provided for no major shift away from the colonial economy.
kenya's agricultural and industrial sectors were dominated by europeans and its commerce and trade by asians; one of kenyatta's most pressing issues was to bring the economy under indigenous control.
there was growing black resentment towards the asian domination of the small business sector, with kenyatta's government putting pressure on asian-owned businesses, intending to replace them with african-owned counterparts.
the 1965 session paper promised an "africanization" of the kenyan economy, with the government increasingly pushing for "black capitalism".
the government established the industrial and commercial development corporation to provide loans for black-owned businesses, and secured a 51% share in the kenya national assurance company.
in 1965, the government established the kenya national trading corporation to ensure indigenous control over the trade in essential commodities, while the trade licensing act of 1967 prohibited non-citizens from involvement in the rice, sugar, and maize trade.
during the 1970s, this expanded to cover the trade in soap, cement, and textiles.
many asians who had retained british citizenship were affected by these measures.
between late 1967 and early 1968, growing numbers of kenyan asians migrated to britain; in february 1968 large numbers migrated quickly before a legal change revoked their right to do so.
kenyatta was not sympathetic to those leaving: "kenya's identity as an african country is not going to be altered by the whims and malaises of groups of uncommitted individuals."
under kenyatta, corruption became widespread throughout the government, civil service, and business community.
kenyatta and his family were tied up with this corruption as they enriched themselves through the mass purchase of property after 1963. their acquisitions in the central, rift valley, and coast provinces aroused great anger among landless kenyans.
his family used his presidential position to circumvent legal or administrative obstacles to acquiring property.
the kenyatta family also heavily invested in the coastal hotel business, kenyatta personally owning the leonard beach hotel.
other businesses they were involved with included ruby mining in tsavo national park, the casino business, the charcoal trade—which was causing significant deforestation—and the ivory trade.
the kenyan press, which was largely loyal to kenyatta, did not delve into this issue; it was only after his death that publications appeared revealing the scale of his personal enrichment.
kenyan corruption and kenyatta's role in it was better known in britain, although many of his british friends—including mcdonald and brockway—chose to believe kenyatta was not personally involved.
the question of land ownership had deep emotional resonance in kenya, having been a major grievance against the british colonialists.
as part of the lancaster house negotiations, britain's government agreed to provide kenya with £27 million with which to buy out white farmers and redistribute their land among the indigenous population.
to ease this transition, kenyatta made mckenzie, a white farmer, the minister of agriculture and land.
kenyatta's government encouraged the establishment of private land-buying companies that were often headed by prominent politicians.
the government sold or leased lands in the former white highlands to these companies, which in turn subdivided them among individual shareholders.
in this way, the land redistribution programs favoured the ruling party's chief constituency.
kenyatta himself expanded the land that he owned around gatundu.
kenyans who made claims to land on the basis of ancestral ownership often found the land given to other people, including kenyans from different parts of the country.
voices began to condemn the redistribution; in 1969, the mp jean-marie seroney censured the sale of historically nandi lands in the rift to non-nandi, describing the settlement schemes as "kenyatta's colonization of the rift".
in part fuelled by high rural unemployment, kenya witnessed growing rural-to-urban migration under kenyatta's government.
this exacerbated urban unemployment and housing shortages, with squatter settlements and slums growing up and urban crime rates rising.
kenyatta was concerned by this, and promoted the reversal of this rural-to-urban migration, but in this was unsuccessful.
kenyatta's government was eager to control the country's trade unions, fearing their ability to disrupt the economy.
to this end it emphasised social welfare schemes over traditional industrial institutions, and in 1965 transformed the kenya federation of labour into the central organization of trade (cot), a body which came under strong government influence.
no strikes could be legally carried out in kenya without cot's permission.
there were also measures to africanise the civil service, which by mid-1967 had become 91% african.
during the 1960s and 1970s the public sector grew faster than the private sector.
the growth in the public sector contributed to the significant expansion of the indigenous middle class in kenyatta's kenya.
the government oversaw a massive expansion in education facilities.
in june 1963, kenyatta ordered the ominda commission to determine a framework for meeting kenya's educational needs.
their report set out the long-term goal of universal free primary education in kenya but argued that the government's emphasis should be on secondary and higher education to facilitate the training of indigenous african personnel to take over the civil service and other jobs requiring such an education.
between 1964 and 1966, the number of primary schools grew by 11.6%, and the number of secondary schools by 80%.
by the time of kenyatta's death, kenya's first universities—the university of nairobi and kenyatta university—had been established.
although kenyatta died without having attained the goal of free, universal primary education in kenya, the country had made significant advances in that direction, with 85% of kenyan children in primary education, and within a decade of independence had trained sufficient numbers of indigenous africans to take over the civil service.
another priority for kenyatta's government was improving access to healthcare services.
it stated that its long-term goal was to establish a system of free, universal medical care.
in the short-term, its emphasis was on increasing the overall number of doctors and registered nurses while decreasing the number of expatriates in those positions.
in 1965, the government introduced free medical services for out-patients and children.
by kenyatta's death, the majority of kenyans had access to significantly better healthcare than they had had in the colonial period.
before independence, the average life expectancy in kenya was 45, but by the end of the 1970s it was 55, the second highest in sub-saharan africa.
this improved medical care had resulted in declining mortality rates while birth rates remained high, resulting in a rapidly growing population; from 1962 to 1979, kenya's population grew by just under 4% a year, the highest rate in the world at the time.
this put a severe strain on social services; kenyatta's government promoted family planning projects to stem the birth-rate, but these had little success.
in part due to his advanced years, kenyatta rarely travelled outside of eastern africa.
under kenyatta, kenya was largely uninvolved in the affairs of other states, including those in the east african community.
despite his reservations about any immediate east african federation, in june 1967 kenyatta signed the treaty for east african co-operation.
in december he attended a meeting with tanzanian and ugandan representatives to form the east african economic community, reflecting kenyatta's cautious approach toward regional integration.
he also took on a mediating role during the congo crisis, heading the organisation of african unity's conciliation commission on the congo.
facing the pressures of the cold war, kenyatta officially pursued a policy of "positive non-alignment".
in reality, his foreign policy was pro-western and in particular pro-british.
kenya became a member of the british commonwealth, using this as a vehicle to put pressure on the white-minority apartheid regimes in south africa and rhodesia.
britain remained one of kenya's foremost sources of foreign trade; british aid to kenya was among the highest in africa.
in 1964, kenya and the uk signed a memorandum of understanding, one of only two military alliances kenyatta's government made; the british special air service trained kenyatta's own bodyguards.
commentators argued that britain's relationship with kenyatta's kenya was a neo-colonial one, with the british having exchanged their position of political power for one of influence.
the historian poppy cullen nevertheless noted that there was no "dictatorial neo-colonial control" in kenyatta's kenya.
although many white kenyans accepted kenyatta's rule, he remained opposed by white far right activists; while in london at the july 1964 commonwealth conference, he was assaulted by martin webster, a british neo-nazi.
kenyatta's relationship with the united states was also warm; the united states agency for international development played a key role in helping respond to a maize shortage in kambaland in 1965. kenyatta also maintained a warm relationship with israel, including when other east african nations endorsed arab hostility to the state; he for instance permitted israeli jets to refuel in kenya on their way back from the entebbe raid.
in turn, in 1976 the israelis warned of a plot by the palestinian liberation army to assassinate him, a threat he took seriously.
kenyatta and his government were anti-communist, and in june 1965 he warned that "it is naive to think that there is no danger of imperialism from the east.
in world power politics the east has as much designs upon us as the west and would like to serve their own interests.
that is why we reject communism. "
his governance was often criticised by communists and other leftists, some of whom accused him of being a fascist.
when chinese communist official zhou enlai visited dar es salaam, his statement that "africa is ripe for revolution" was clearly aimed largely at kenya.
in 1964, kenyatta impounded a secret shipment of chinese armaments that passed through kenyan territory on its way to uganda.
obote personally visited kenyatta to apologise.
in june 1967, kenyatta declared the chinese chargé d'affairs persona non grata in kenya and recalled the kenyan ambassador from peking.
relations with the soviet union were also strained; kenyatta shut down the lumumba institute—an educational organisation named after the congolese independence leader patrice lumumba—on the basis that it was a front for soviet influence in kenya.
kenyatta made clear his desire for kenya to become a one-party state, regarding this as a better expression of national unity than a multi-party system.
in the first five years of independence, he consolidated control of the central government, removing the autonomy of kenya's provinces to prevent the entrenchment of ethnic power bases.
he argued that centralised control of the government was needed to deal with the growth in demands for local services and to assist quicker economic development.
in 1966, it launched a commission to examine reforms to local government operations, and in 1969 passed the transfer of functions act, which terminated grants to local authorities and transferred major services from provincial to central control.
a major focus for kenyatta during the first three and a half years of kenya's independence were the divisions within kanu itself.
opposition to kenyatta's government grew, particularly following the assassination of pio pinto in february 1965. kenyatta condemned the assassination of the prominent leftist politician, although uk intelligence agencies believed that his own bodyguard had orchestrated the murder.
relations between kenyatta and odinga were strained, and at the march 1966 party conference, odinga's post—that of party vice president—was divided among eight different politicians, greatly limiting his power and ending his position as kenyatta's automatic successor.
between 1964 and 1966, kenyatta and other kanu conservatives had been deliberately trying to push odinga to resign from the party.
under growing pressure, in 1966 odinga stepped down as state vice president, claiming that kenya had failed to achieve economic independence and needed to adopt socialist policies.
backed by several other senior kanu figures and trade unionists, he became head of the new kenya peoples union (kpu).
in its manifesto, the kpu stated that it would pursue "truly socialist policies" like the nationalisation of public utilities; it claimed kenyatta's government "want[ed] to build a capitalist system in the image of western capitalism but are too embarrassed or dishonest to call it that."
the kpu were legally recognised as the official opposition, thus restoring the country's two party system.
the new party was a direct challenge to kenyatta's rule, and he regarded it as a communist-inspired plot to oust him.
soon after the kpu's creation, the kenyan parliament amended the constitution to ensure that the defectors—who had originally been elected on the kanu ticket—could not automatically retain their seats and would have to stand for re-election.
this resulted in the election of june 1966. the luo increasingly rallied around the kpu, which experienced localized violence that hindered its ability to campaign, although kenyatta's government officially disavowed this violence.
kanu retained the support of all national newspapers and the government-owned radio and television stations.
of the 29 defectors, only 9 were re-elected on the kpu ticket; odinga was among them, having retained his central nyanza seat with a high majority.
odinga was replaced as vice president by joseph murumbi, who in turn would be replaced by moi.
in july 1969, mboya—a prominent and popular luo kanu politician—was assassinated by a kikuyu.
kenyatta had reportedly been concerned that mboya, with u.s. backing, could remove him from the presidency, and across kenya there were suspicions voiced that kenyatta's government was responsible for mboya's death.
the killing sparked tensions between the kikuyu and other ethnic groups across the country, with riots breaking out in nairobi.
in october 1969, kenyatta visited kisumu, located in luo territory, to open a hospital.
on being greeted by a crowd shouting kpu slogans, he lost his temper.
when members of the crowd started throwing stones, kenyatta's bodyguards opened fire on them, killing and wounding several.
in response to the rise of kpu, kenyatta had introduced oathing, a kikuyu cultural tradition in which individuals came to gatundu to swear their loyalty to him.
journalists were discouraged from reporting on the oathing system, and several were deported when they tried to do so.
many kenyans were pressured or forced to swear oaths, something condemned by the country's christian establishment.
in response to the growing condemnation, the oathing was terminated in september 1969, and kenyatta invited leaders from other ethnic groups to a meeting in gatundu.
kenyatta's government resorted to un-democratic measures to restrict the opposition.
it used laws on detention and deportation to perpetuate its political hold.
in 1966, it passed the public security (detained and restricted persons) regulations, allowing the authorities to arrest and detain anyone "for the preservation of public security" without putting them on trial.
in october 1969 the government banned the kpu, and arrested odinga before putting him under indefinite detainment.
with the organised opposition eliminated, from 1969, kenya was once again a de facto one-party state.
the december 1969 general election—in which all candidates were from the ruling kanu—resulted in kenyatta's government remaining in power, but many members of his government lost their parliamentary seats to rivals from within the party.
over coming years, many other political and intellectual figures considered hostile to kenyatta's rule were detained or imprisoned, including seroney, flomena chelagat, george anyona, martin shikuku, and ngũgĩ wa thiong'o.
other political figures who were critical of kenyatta's administration, including ronald ngala and josiah mwangi kariuki, were killed in incidents that many speculated were government assassinations.
for many years, kenyatta had suffered health problems.
he had a mild stroke in 1966, and a second in may 1968. he suffered from gout and heart problems, all of which he sought to keep hidden from the public.
by 1970, he was increasingly feeble and senile, and by 1975 kenyatta had—according to maloba—"in effect ceased to actively govern".
four kikuyu politicians—koinange, james gichuru, njoroge mungai, and charles njonjo—formed his inner circle of associates, and he was rarely seen in public without one of them present.
this clique faced opposition from kanu back-benchers spearheaded by kariuki; in march 1975, he was kidnapped, tortured, and murdered, and his body dumped in the ngong hills.
after kariuku's murder, maloba noted, there was a "noticeable erosion" of support for kenyatta and his government.
thenceforth, when the president spoke to crowds, they no longer applauded his statements.
in 1977, kenyatta had several further strokes or heart attacks.
on 22 august 1978, he died of a heart attack in the state house, mombasa.
the kenyan government had been preparing for kenyatta's death since at least his 1968 stroke; it had requested british assistance in organising his state funeral as a result of the uk's longstanding experience in this area.
mckenzie had been employed as a go-between, and the structure of the funeral was orchestrated to deliberately imitate that of deceased british prime minister winston churchill.
in doing so, senior kenyans sought to project an image of their country as a modern nation-state rather than one incumbent on tradition.
the funeral took place at st. andrew's presbyterian church, six days after kenyatta's death.
britain's heir to the throne, charles, prince of wales, attended the event, a symbol of the value that the british government perceived in its relationship with kenya.
african heads of state also attended, including nyerere, idi amin, kenneth kaunda, and hastings banda, as did india's morarji desai and pakistan's muhammad zia-ul-haq.
his body was buried in a mausoleum in the parliament grounds.
kenyatta's succession had been an issue of debate since independence, and kenyatta had not unreservedly nominated a successor.
the kikuyu clique surrounding him had sought to amend the constitution to prevent vice president moi—who was from the kalenjin people rather than the kikuyu—from automatically becoming acting president, but their attempts failed amid sustained popular and parliamentary opposition.
after kenyatta's death, the transition of power proved smooth, surprising many international commentators.
as vice president, moi was sworn in as acting president for a 90-day interim period.
in october he was unanimously elected kanu president and subsequently declared president of kenya itself.
moi emphasised his loyalty to kenyatta—"i followed and was faithful to him until his last day, even when his closest friends forsook him"—and there was much expectation that he would continue the policies inaugurated by kenyatta.
he nevertheless criticised the corruption, land grabbing, and capitalistic ethos that had characterised kenyatta's period and expressed populist tendencies by emphasising a closer link to the poor.
in 1982 he would amend the kenyan constitution to create a de jure one-party state.
— kenyatta biographer guy arnold
kenyatta was an african nationalist, and was committed to the belief that european colonial rule in africa must end.
like other anti-colonialists, he believed that under colonialism, the human and natural resources of africa had been used not for the benefit of africa's population but for the enrichment of the colonisers and their european homelands.
for kenyatta, independence meant not just self-rule, but an end to the colour bar and to the patronising attitudes and racist slang of kenya's white minority.
according to murray-brown, kenyatta's "basic philosophy" throughout his life was that "all men deserved the right to develop peacefully according to their own wishes".
kenyatta expressed this in his statement that "i have stood always for the purposes of human dignity in freedom, and for the values of tolerance and peace."
this approach was similar to the zambian president kenneth kaunda's ideology of "african humanism".
murray-brown noted that "kenyatta had always kept himself free from ideological commitments", while the historian william r. ochieng observed that "kenyatta articulated no particular social philosophy".
similarly, assensoh noted that kenyatta was "not interested in social philosophies and slogans".
several commentators and biographers described him as being politically conservative, an ideological viewpoint likely bolstered by his training in functionalist anthropology.
he pursued, according to maloba, "a conservatism that worked in concert with imperial powers and was distinctly hostile to radical politics".
kenyatta biographer guy arnold described the kenyan leader as "a pragmatist and a moderate", noting that his only "radicalism" came in the form of his "nationalist attack" on imperialism.
arnold also noted that kenyatta "absorbed a great deal of the british approach to politics: pragmatism, only dealing with problems when they become crises, [and] tolerance as long as the other side is only talking".
donald savage noted that kenyatta believed in "the importance of authority and tradition", and that he displayed "a remarkably consistent view of development through self-help and hard work".
kenyatta was also an elitist and encouraged the emergence of an elite class in kenya.
he wrestled with a contradiction between his conservative desire for a renewal of traditional custom and his reformist urges to embrace western modernity.
he also faced a contradiction between his internal debates on kikuyu ethics and belief in tribal identity with his need to create a non-tribalised kenyan nationalism.
while in britain, kenyatta made political alliances with individuals committed to marxism and to radical pan-africanism, the idea that african countries should politically unify; some commentators have posthumously characterised kenyatta as a pan-africanist.
maloba observed that during the colonial period kenyatta had embraced "radical pan african activism" that differed sharply from the "deliberate conservative positions, especially on the question of african liberation" that he espoused while kenya's leader.
as leader of kenya, kenyatta published two collected volumes of his speeches: harambee and suffering without bitterness.
the material included in these publications was carefully selected so as to avoid mention of the radicalism he exhibited while in britain during the 1930s.
kenyatta had been exposed to marxist-leninist ideas through his friendship with padmore and the time spent in the soviet union, but had also been exposed to western forms of liberal democratic government through his many years in britain.
he appears to have had no further involvement with the communist movement after 1934. as kenya's leader, kenyatta rejected the idea that marxism offered a useful framework for analysing his country's socio-economic situation.
the academics bruce j. berman and john m. lonsdale argued that marxist frameworks for analysing society influenced some of his beliefs, such as his view that british colonialism had to be destroyed rather than simply reformed.
kenyatta nevertheless disagreed with the marxist attitude that tribalism was backward and retrograde; his positive attitude toward tribal society frustrated some of kenyatta's marxist pan-africanist friends in britain, among them padmore, james, and ras t. makonnen, who regarded it as parochial and un-progressive.
assensoh suggested that kenyatta initially had socialist inclinations but "became a victim of capitalist circumstances"; conversely, savage stated that "kenyatta's direction was hardly towards the creation of a radical new socialist society", and ochieng called him "an african capitalist".
when in power, kenyatta displayed a preoccupation with individual and mbari land rights that were at odds with any socialist-oriented collectivisation.
according to maloba, kenyatta's government "sought to project capitalism as an african ideology, and communism (or socialism) as alien and dangerous".
— kenyatta biographer jeremy murray-brown
kenyatta was a flamboyant character, with an extroverted personality.
according to murray-brown, he "liked being at the centre of life", and was always "a rebel at heart" who enjoyed "earthly pleasures".
one of kenyatta's fellow lse students, elspeth huxley, referred to him as "a showman to his finger tips; jovial, a good companion, shrewd, fluent, quick, devious, subtle, [and] flesh-pot loving".
kenyatta liked to dress elaborately; throughout most of his adult life, he wore finger rings and while studying at university in london took to wearing a fez and cloak and carrying a silver-topped black cane.
he adopted his surname, "kenyatta", after the name of a beaded belt he often wore in early life.
as president he collected a variety of expensive cars.
murray-brown noted that kenyatta had the ability to "appear all things to all men", also displaying a "consummate ability to keep his true purposes and abilities to himself", for instance concealing his connections with communists and the soviet union both from members of the british labour party and from kikuyu figures at home.
this deviousness was sometimes interpreted as dishonesty by those who met him.
referring to kenyatta's appearance in 1920s kenya, murray-brown stated the leader presented himself to europeans as "an agreeable if somewhat seedy 'europeanized' native" and to indigenous africans as "a sophisticated man-about-town about whose political earnestness they had certain reservations".
simon gikandi argued that kenyatta, like some of his contemporaries in the pan-african movement, was an "afro-victorian", someone whose identity had been shaped "by the culture of colonialism and colonial institutions", especially those of the victorian era.
during the 1920s and 1930s, kenyatta cultivated the image of a "colonial gentleman"; in england, he displayed "pleasant manners" and a flexible attitude in adapting to urban situations dissimilar to the lands he had grown up in.
a. r. barlow, a member of the church of scotland mission at kikuyu, met with kenyatta in britain, later relating that he was impressed by how kenyatta could "mix on equal terms with europeans and to hold his end up in spite of his handicaps, educationally and socially."
the south african peter abrahams met kenyatta in london, noting that of all the black men involved in the city's pan-africanist movement, he was "the most relaxed, sophisticated and 'westernized' of the lot of us".
as president, kenyatta often reminisced nostalgically about his time in england, referring to it as "home" on several occasions.
berman and lonsdale described his life as being preoccupied with "a search for the reconciliation of the western modernity he embraced and an equally valued kikuyuness he could not discard".
gikandi argued that kenyatta's "identification with englishness was much more profound than both his friends and enemies have been willing to admit".
kenyatta has also been described as a talented orator, author, and editor.
he had dictatorial and autocratic tendencies, as well as a fierce temper that could emerge as rage on occasion.
murray-brown noted that kenyatta could be "quite unscrupulous, even brutal" in using others to get what he wanted, but that he never displayed any physical cruelty or nihilism.
kenyatta had no racist impulses regarding white europeans, as can, for instance, be seen through his marriage to a white english woman.
he told his daughter that "the english are wonderful people to live with in england."
he welcomed white support for his cause, so long as it was generous and unconditional, and spoke of a kenya in which indigenous africans, europeans, arabs, and indians could all regard themselves as kenyans, working and living alongside each other peacefully.
he nevertheless exhibited a general dislike of indians, believing that they exploited indigenous africans in kenya.
— kenyatta, april 1961
a polygamist, kenyatta had three wives.
he viewed monogamy through an anthropological lens as an interesting western phenomenon but did not adopt the practice himself, instead having sexual relations with a wide range of women throughout his life.
murray-brown characterised kenyatta as an "affectionate father" to his children, but one who was frequently absent.
kenyatta had two children from his first marriage with grace wahu: son peter muigai kenyatta (born 1920), who later became a deputy minister; and daughter margaret kenyatta (born 1928).
margaret served as mayor of nairobi between 1970 and 1976 and then as kenya's ambassador to the united nations from 1976 to 1986. of these children, it was margaret who was kenyatta's closest confidante.
during his trial, kenyatta described himself as a christian, stating that "i do not follow any particular denomination.
i believe in christianity as a whole."
arnold stated that in england, kenyatta's adherence to christianity was "desultory".
while in london, kenyatta had taken an interest in the atheist speakers at speakers' corner in hyde park, while an irish muslim friend had unsuccessfully urged kenyatta to convert to islam.
during his imprisonment, kenyatta read up on islam, hinduism, buddhism, and confucianism through books supplied to him by stock.
the israeli diplomat asher naim visited him in this period, noting that although kenyatta was "not a religious man, he was appreciative of the bible".
despite portraying himself as a christian, he found the attitudes of many european missionaries intolerable, in particular their readiness to see everything african as evil.
in facing mount kenya, he challenged the missionaries' dismissive attitude toward ancestor veneration, which he instead preferred to call "ancestor communion".
in that book's dedication, kenyatta invoked "ancestral spirits" as part of "the fight for african freedom."
within kenya, kenyatta came to be regarded as the "father of the nation", and was given the unofficial title of mzee, a swahili term meaning "grand old man".
from 1963 until his death, a cult of personality surrounded him in the country, one which deliberately interlinked kenyan nationalism with kenyatta's own personality.
this use of kenyatta as a popular symbol of the nation itself was furthered by the similarities between their names.
he came to be regarded as a father figure not only by kikuyu and kenyans, but by africans more widely.
after 1963, maloba noted, kenyatta became "about the most admired post-independence african leader" on the world stage, one who western countries hailed as a "beloved elder statesman."
his opinions were "most valued" both by conservative african politicians and by western leaders.
on becoming kenya's leader, his anti-communist positions gained favour in the west, and some pro-western governments gave him awards; in 1965 he, for instance, received medals from both pope paul vi and the south korean government.
in 1974, arnold referred to kenyatta as "one of the outstanding african leaders now living", someone who had become "synonymous with kenya".
he added that kenyatta had been "one of the shrewdest politicians" on the continent, regarded as "one of the great architects of african nationalist achievement since 1945".
kenneth o. nyangena characterised him as "one of the greatest men of the twentieth century", having been "a beacon, a rallying point for suffering kenyans to fight for their rights, justice and freedom" whose "brilliance gave strength and aspiration to people beyond the boundaries of kenya".
in 2018, maloba described him as "one of the legendary pioneers of modern african nationalism".
in their examination of his writings, berman and lonsdale described him as a "pioneer" for being one of the very first kikuyu to write and publish; "his representational achievement was unique".
maxon noted that in the areas of health and education, kenya under kenyatta "achieved more in a decade and a half than the colonial state had accomplished in the preceding six decades."
by the time of kenyatta's death, kenya had gained higher life expectancy rates than most of sub-saharan africa.
there had been an expansion in primary, secondary, and higher education, and the country had taken what maxon called "giant steps" toward achieving its goal of universal primary education for kenyan children.
another significant success had been in dismantling the colonial-era system of racial segregation in schools, public facilities, and social clubs peacefully and with minimal disruption.
during much of his life, kenya's white settlers had regarded kenyatta as a malcontent and an agitator; for them, he was a figure of hatred and fear.
as noted by arnold, "no figure in the whole of british africa, with the possible exception of [nkrumah], excited among the settlers and the colonial authorities alike so many expressions of anger, denigration and fury as did kenyatta."
as the historian keith kyle put it, for many whites kenyatta was "satan incarnate".
this white animosity reached its apogee between 1950 and 1952. by 1964, this image had largely shifted, and many white settlers referred to him as "good old mzee".
murray-brown expressed the view that for many, kenyatta's "message of reconciliation, 'to forgive and forget', was perhaps his greatest contribution to his country and to history."
to ochieng, kenyatta was "a personification of conservative social forces and tendencies" in kenya.
towards the end of his presidency, many younger kenyans—while respecting kenyatta's role in attaining independence—regarded him as a reactionary.
those desiring a radical transformation of kenyan society often compared kenyatta's kenya unfavourably with its southern neighbour, nyerere's tanzania.
the criticisms that leftists like odinga made of kenyatta's leadership were similar to those that the intellectual frantz fanon had made of post-colonial leaders throughout africa.
drawing upon marxist theory, jay o'brien, for instance, argued that kenyatta had come to power "as a representative of a would-be bourgeoisie", a coalition of "relatively privileged petty bourgeois african elements" who wanted simply to replace the british colonialists and "asian commercial bourgeoisie" with themselves.
he suggested that the british supported kenyatta in this, seeing him as a bulwark against growing worker and peasant militancy who would ensure continued neo-colonial dominance.
providing a similar leftist critique, the marxist writer ngũgĩ wa thiong'o stated that "here was a black moses who had been called by history to lead his people to the promised land of no exploitation, no oppression, but who failed to rise to the occasion".
ngũgĩ saw kenyatta as a "twentieth-century tragic figure: he could have been a lenin, a mao tse-tung, or a ho chi minh; but he ended up being a chiang kai-shek, a park-chung hee, or a pinochet."
ngũgĩ was among kenyan critics who claimed that kenyatta treated mau mau veterans dismissively, leaving many of them impoverished and landless while seeking to remove them from the centre stage of national politics.
in other areas kenyatta's government also faced criticism; it for instance made little progress in advancing women's rights in kenya.
assensoh argued that in his life story, kenyatta had a great deal in common with ghana's nkrumah.
simon gikandi noted that kenyatta, like nkrumah, was remembered for "initiating the discourse and process that plotted the narrative of african freedom", but at the same time both were "often remembered for their careless institution of presidential rule, one party dictatorship, ethnicity and cronyism.
they are remembered both for making the dream of african independence a reality and for their invention of postcolonial authoritarianism.
"in 1991, the kenyan lawyer and human rights activist gibson kamau kuria noted that in abolishing the federal system, banning independent candidates from standing in elections, setting up a unicameral legislature, and relaxing restrictions on the use of emergency powers, kenyatta had laid "the groundwork" for moi to further advance dictatorial power in kenya during the late 1970s and 1980s.
kenyatta was accused by kenya's truth, justice and reconciliation commission in its 2013 report of using his authority as president to allocate large tracts of land to himself and his family across kenya.
the kenyatta family is among kenya's biggest landowners.
during the 1990s, there was still much frustration among tribal groups, namely in the nandi, nakuru, uasin-gishu, and trans-nzoia districts, that under kenyatta's government they had not regained the lands taken by european settlers and that more of their land had been sold to those regarded as "foreigners"—kenyans from other tribes.
among these groups there were widespread calls for restitution and in 1991 and 1992 there were violent attacks against many of those who obtained land through kenyatta's patronage in these areas.
the violence continued sporadically until 1996, with an estimated 1500 killed and 300,000 displaced in the rift valley.

with a background in jazz, her work extends into other musical genres, including latin rhythms.
she has released a number of solo and collaborative albums and singles, and her 2008 album caminho won a gold disc.
she has twice received nominations for the fryderyk polish music awards.
dorota miśkiewicz was born on 12 september 1973 in kłodzko, southern poland.
her father henryk (born 1951) is a well-known jazz saxophonist and composer.
her younger brother michał (born 1977) would become a jazz percussionist, winning fryderyk awards with the simple acoustic trio (renamed the marcin wasilewski trio in 2008).
dorota studied the violin at the fryderyk chopin music academy in warsaw, graduating in 1997. in 1994 she joined the sextet of jazz musician włodzimierz nahorny, recording four albums with the group as vocalist and violinist.
miśkiewicz has given many performances in poland and internationally as a solo artist and alongside others, including with nigel kennedy in vienna and belgrade.

her first solo album, featuring songs which she herself composed, was released in 2002 and titled dorota miśkiewicz goes to heaven - zatrzymaj się ("stop").
it was nominated for the fryderyk prize for jazz album of the year.
her next album was released in october 2004, entitled pod rzęsami ("under the eyelashes").
it featured the track "w małych istnieniach" ("in small existences") which had qualified for the premieres competition at the opole festival.
the album's title track, recorded with grzegorz turnau, had featured on the soundtrack of the film zakochany anioł ("beloved angel").
the album also featured the single poza czasem ("beyond time").
her third album was released in september 2008, and is titled caminho (meaning "way" or "path" in portuguese).

the album won a gold disc and a fryderyk nomination.
according to the rzeczpospolita newspaper, although her background is in jazz, she has successfully turned her hand to other genres, including pop, bossa nova and samba.
her fourth album ale ("but") was released in may 2012.
a carranca (portuguese, literally "scowl" with another definition as "figurehead"; portuguese pronunciation: [kaˈʁɐ̃kɐ]) is a type of figurehead attached to river craft which is attributed with power to protect the boatmen from the river's evil spirits.
the culture in brazil incorporated elements of the indigenous culture, so that the idea of river spirits and forest spirits can help or hinder a crossing is also natural of the amerindian imaginary.
they were once commonly found on the lower rio são francisco in brazil's northeast region (nordeste).
the carranca is most commonly a figure of a human or an animal.
they were used to identify traders operating on the são francisco and, as with ancient figureheads, serve the superstitious as guardians on the river.
today most authentic carrancas and early folk art revivals are only found in museums with some being subject of a rio exhibition in 2002. four historic examples are featured on the front of the home of roberto burle marx, now the national monument, sítio roberto burle marx.
modern, more stylized versions are sometimes seen as decorations in restaurants or homes and commonly seen in tourist shops of the states of bahia, pernambuco, sergipe and alagoas where the historic use was found on the lower rio são francisco.
these range from key chain figures up to very large ones a meter or more in height and made from large tree trunks.
many, if not most of those are in the carranca-vampiro style rather than the classic boat figurehead styles of the past.
the difference may be seen by comparing the photos of classic styles compared to the tourist versions pictured on this page.
classic figurehead versions, dating from the early 19th or even late 18th centuries, were painted, frequently chalk white with black hair, gaping red mouths and white fangs.
the most common tourist versions follow similar schemes.
a more modern, decorative unpainted version is often in natural wood and even polished.
while most of the modern tourist versions are produced quickly in quantity using one of several patterns a few are made by more artistic wood workers and show unique design or interpretations of "functional" carrancas from history.
a very few of these are "museum quality" folk art displayed in folk art museums of brazil.
francisco alves mendes filho, better known as chico mendes (december 15, 1944 – december 22, 1988), was a brazilian rubber tapper, trade union leader and environmentalist.
he fought to preserve the amazon rainforest, and advocated for the human rights of brazilian peasants and indigenous peoples.
he was assassinated by a rancher on december 22, 1988. the chico mendes institute for conservation of biodiversity (instituto chico mendes de conservação da biodiversidade), a body under the jurisdiction of the brazilian ministry of the environment, is named in his honor.
francisco "loco" alves mendes filho was born on december 15, 1944, in a rubber reserve called seringal bom futuro, outside of xapuri, a small town in the state of acre.
he was the son of a second-generation rubber tapper, francisco mendes, and his wife, iracê.
chico was one of 17 siblings—only six of whom survived childhood.
at age 9, chico began work as a rubber tapper alongside his father.
the primary use for rubber then was for the rapid need for condoms.
the 80s was an era of unprotected intercourse, and the demand for the rubber suits were at alarming rate.
the government and cattle ranchers expelled many seringueiros from their land, including areas near xapuri due to tensions surrounding the new invention of latex.
at the time, the rubber industry across the nation was in decline, and land was frequently sold and burned for cattle pastures.
rubber tappers additionally faced a severe lack of education.
schools were frequently forbidden on and near plantations, as the owners did not want the workers to be able to read and do arithmetic.
for this reason, mendes did not learn to read until he was 18 years old, when he sought out help interpreting his bills.
mendes was taught to read and write by a man named euclides fernando távora, an activist turned rubber tapper.
most of his practice came from newspaper clippings on social and political issues within brazil.
these articles opened chico’s eyes to the widespread injustices in society, adding to his dissatisfaction with the treatment of seringueiros.
after learning what he could from távora, mendes became a literacy teacher in hopes of educating his community.
as his fellow workers became more aware of unjust treatment, they formed the rural workers’ union, and the more localized xapuri rubber tappers union.
both of these organizations worked through peaceful protest to stop the logging and burning of the rainforest that acted as their livelihood.
by the mid-1980s, chico was known as both a radical unionist and an activist, though he also ran for several local political positions such as state deputy and city councilor.
at first i thought i was fighting to save rubber trees, then i thought i was fighting to save the amazon rainforest.
now i realize i am fighting for humanity.
to save the rainforest, chico mendes and the rubber workers union asked the government to set up reserves as they wanted people to use the forest without damaging it.
they also used a very effective technique they called the 'empate' where rubber tappers blocked the way into rubber reserves, preventing their destruction.
the rubber tappers' union was created in 1975 in the nearby town of brasileia, with wilson pinheiro elected as the union's president and mendes as its secretary.
mendes also played a central role in the creation of the national council of rubber tappers in the mid-1980s.
mendes' group also had strong ties with the national campaign for the defence and development of the amazon, and helped organize local workers' party support.
when the first meeting of this new union was held in 1985 in the capital brasilia, rubber tappers from all over the country came.
the discussion expanded from the threats to their own livelihoods to the larger issues of road paving, cattle ranching, and deforestation.
the meeting also caught the attention of the international environmentalist movement, giving the rubber tappers a larger audience for their grievances.
the group embraced a larger alliance with environmentalism, rather than strict marxism, in spite of the bourgeois associations of the former.
another result of these discussions was the coining of the concept and the term "extractive reserves".
in november of that year, adrian cowell, an english filmmaker, filmed much of the proceedings of this meeting as part of a documentary he was making about mendes, which aired in 1990.
mendes believed that relying on rubber tapping alone was not sustainable, and that the seringueiros needed to develop more holistic, cooperative systems that used a variety of forest products, such as nuts, fruit, oil, and fibers; and that they needed to focus on building strong communities with quality education for their children.
in march 1987, the environmental defense fund and national wildlife federation flew mendes to washington, d.c. in an attempt to convince the inter-american development bank, world bank, and u.s. congress to support the creation of extractive reserves.
mendes won several awards for his work, including the united nations environmental program global 500 roll of honor award in 1987, and the national wildlife federation's national conservation achievement award in 1988.
in 1988 a man named darly alves da silva bought part of a rubber reserve called cachoeira, where relatives of mendes lived, and which was affiliated to the local rural workers union in xapuri.
while the sale of the section was disputed by the family of the vendor, who claimed he had no legal right to sell it, silva tried to drive them off their land and increase his ranch holdings.
the rubber tappers of cachoeira stood firm and set up road blocks to keep silva out.
in 1988, mendes launched a campaign to stop silva from logging the area that its inhabitants wanted demarcated as an extractive reserve.
mendes not only managed to stop the planned deforestation and create the reserve,[citation needed] but also gained a warrant for darly's arrest for a murder committed in another state, paraná.
he delivered the warrant to the federal police, but it was never acted upon.
mendes had received death threats for years before his murder.
however, in the months prior to his death, various pairs of gunmen hired by silva observed mendes from a square near his house and the town union hall.
on the evening of thursday, december 22, 1988, mendes was assassinated in his xapuri home by darci, the son of darly alves da silva.
the shooting took place exactly one week after mendes' 44th birthday when he had predicted he would "not live until christmas".
around his birthday, the gunmen who had been observing him disappeared completely.
their absence gave the community a sense of impending doom, as they had been constantly present since may of the same year.
the timing of their disappearance led many to believe they had unsuccessfully attempted to kill mendes on his birthday but had failed because of numerous guests present at his house.
mendes was the 90th rural activist murdered that year in brazil.
many felt that although the trial was proceeding against mendes' killers, the roles of the ranchers' union, the rural democratic union, and the brazilian federal police in his death were ignored.
in december 1990, silva, his son darci, and their employee jerdeir pereira were sentenced to 19 years in prison for their part in mendes' assassination.
in february 1992, they won a retrial, claiming that the prosecution's primary witness (mendes' wife) was biased.
the conviction was upheld, and they remained in prison.
in 1993, they escaped from jail, along with seven other prisoners, by sawing through the bars of their prison window.
all were recaptured, including darly jr., who served the remainder of his sentence with the other killers before returning to xapuri.
mendes' murder made international headlines and led to an outpouring of support for the rubber tappers' and environmental movements.
in march 1989, a third meeting was held for the national council of rubber tappers, and the alliance of forest peoples was created to protect rubber tappers, rural workers, and indigenous peoples from encroachment on traditional lands.
chico mendes’ death legitimized the struggle for conservation and unionization in the amazon for a global audience, and support for the movements poured in immediately following his death.
the strides forward made by activists in the wake of mendes’ death are multifaceted, encompassing indigenous sovereignty and alliance, the formation of extractive reserves, and government support for mendes’ activism.
the national council of rubber tappers was founded in 1985 by mendes and other union members; in march 1989, three months after mendes’ murder, the council held their third meeting.
the council issued twenty-seven demands on environmental and human rights protection.
they also issued the following statement, titled the declaration of the peoples of the forest:
“the traditional peoples who today trace on the amazonian sky the rainbow of the alliance of the peoples of the forest declare their wish to see their regions preserved.
they know that the development of the potential of their people and of the regions they inhabit is to be found in the future economy of their communities, and must be preserved for the whole brazilian nation as part of its identity and self-esteem.
this alliance of the peoples of the forest, bringing together indians, rubber tappers, and riverbank communities, and founded here in acre, embraces all efforts to protect and preserve this immense but fragile life-system that involves out forests, lakes, rivers and springs, the source of our wealth and the basis of our cultures and traditions.”
this indicates an increase in perceived support and an ensuing increase in demands by the national council, responding to the context of mendes’ death.
1986 marks the creation of the alliance of forest peoples, tasked with protecting rubber tappers, rural workers, and indigenous peoples from encroachment on traditional lands, and this group also found new footholds in the wake of mendes’ murder.
this political leverage gave the people of the forest (largely rubber tappers and indigenous people) access to important victories.
one of the most important and tangible victories was the demarcation of kayapo and yanomami lands in november 1991, overseen by the collor administration.
however, despite the successes indigenous peoples saw in land recognition during this time, the sovereign nations experienced intense violence within their borders by outsiders during the following years.
the years after mendes’ murder also saw a focus on mendes’ personal advocacy projects.
one of mendes’ main ideas, and a lasting impact of his life and activism, is brazil’s extractive reserves - forest land set aside by the brazilian government to be managed cooperatively by locals, who keep it healthy while gathering its rubber, nuts, and other products to sell.
these extractive reserves are funded in part by the world bank, which once financed roads to make the amazon easier to cut down.
their change of heart can be attributed to mendes’ in-person, extensive lobbying of the organization.
following the increased pressure by the international community in the wake of the violence, the brazilian government agreed to create extractive reserves and to demarcate indian lands.
the increased local support for mendes’ activism also saw several of mendes’ co-campaigners were elected to important government offices over the next decade, which created a more receptive environment for legislation protecting the amazon forests.
furthermore, the brazilian government has declared him patron of the brazilian environment.
institutions have been named after him, including the main state agency in charge of conservation – the instituto chico mendes de conservação da biodiversidade.
in 2013 a species of bird, chico's tyrannulet (zimmerius chicomendesi), was named after him.
following his death, the chico mendes extractive reserve was created in march 12, 1990 with the intention of maintaining sustainability of resources within the amazon forests.
the chico mendes extractive reserve is the largest extractive reserve within the amazon, covering nearly one million hectares of land.
its creation marked a shift for reserves within the amazon, after which many other extractive reserves were established.
they now account for approximately 13% of the amazon's total area.
songs inspired directly or in part by mendes include:
christopher columbus[a] (/kəˈlʌmbəs/; before 31 october 1451 – 20 may 1506) was an italian explorer and colonizer who completed four voyages across the atlantic ocean that opened the new world for conquest and permanent european colonization of the americas.
his expeditions, sponsored by the catholic monarchs of spain, were the first european contact with the caribbean, central america, and south america.
columbus's early life is somewhat obscure, but scholars generally agree that he was born in the republic of genoa and spoke a dialect of ligurian as his first language.
he went to sea at a young age and travelled widely, as far north as the british isles (and possibly iceland) and as far south as what is now ghana.
he married portuguese noblewoman filipa moniz perestrelo and was based in lisbon for several years, but later took a castilian mistress; he had one son with each woman.
though largely self-educated, columbus was widely read in geography, astronomy, and history.
he formulated a plan to seek a western sea passage to the east indies, hoping to profit from the lucrative spice trade.
following persistent lobbying, queen isabella i and king ferdinand ii agreed to sponsor a journey west, in the name of the crown of castile.
columbus left castile in august 1492 with three ships, and after a stopover in the canary islands made landfall in the americas on 12 october (later celebrated as columbus day).
his landing place was an island in the bahamas, known by its native inhabitants as guanahani; its exact location is uncertain.
columbus subsequently visited the islands now known as cuba and hispaniola, establishing a colony in what is now haiti—the first european settlement in the americas since the norse colonies nearly 500 years earlier.
he arrived back in castile in early 1493, bringing a number of captive natives with him.
word of his voyages soon spread throughout europe.
columbus made three further voyages to the new world, exploring the lesser antilles in 1493, trinidad and the northern coast of south america in 1498, and the eastern coast of central america in 1502. many of the names he gave to geographical features—particularly islands—are still in use.
he continued to seek a passage to the east indies, and the extent to which he was aware that the americas were a wholly separate landmass is uncertain.
he never clearly renounced his belief that he had reached the far east and gave the name indios ("indians") to the indigenous peoples he encountered.
columbus's strained relationship with the spanish crown and its appointed colonial administrators in america led to his arrest and removal from hispaniola in 1500, and later to protracted litigation over the benefits that he and his heirs claimed were owed to them by the crown.
columbus's expeditions inaugurated a period of exploration, conquest, and colonization that lasted for centuries, helping create the modern western world.
the transfers between the old world and new world that followed his first voyage are known as the columbian exchange, and the period of human habitation in the americas prior to his arrival is referred to as the pre-columbian era.
columbus's legacy continues to be debated.
he was widely venerated in the centuries after his death, but public perceptions have changed as recent scholars have given greater attention to negative aspects of his life, such as his enslavement of the indigenous population in his quest for gold and his brutal subjugation of the taíno people, leading to their near-extinction, as well as allegations of tyranny towards spanish colonists.
many landmarks and institutions in the western hemisphere bear his name, including the country of colombia and the name columbia, which is used as a personification for the united states, and appears in many place names there.
the name christopher columbus is the anglicisation of the latin christophorus columbus.
his name in ligurian is  cristoffa corombo, in italian cristoforo colombo, in spanish cristóbal colón, and in portuguese, cristóvão colombo.
he was born before 31 october 1451 in the territory of the republic of genoa (now part of modern italy), though the exact location remains disputed.
[b] his father was domenico colombo, a wool weaver who worked both in genoa and savona and who also owned a cheese stand at which young christopher worked as a helper.
his mother was susanna fontanarossa.
he had three brothers, bartolomeo, giovanni pellegrino, and giacomo .
he also had a sister named bianchinetta.
his brother bartolomeo worked in a cartography workshop in lisbon for at least part of his adulthood.
columbus never wrote in his native language, which is presumed to have been a genoese variety of ligurian: his name in the 16th-century genoese language would have been cristoffa corombo (ligurian pronunciation: [kriˈʃtɔffa kuˈɹuŋbu]).
in one of his writings, he says he went to sea at the age of 10. in 1470, the columbus family moved to savona, where domenico took over a tavern.
in the same year, christopher was on a genoese ship hired in the service of rené of anjou to support his attempt to conquer the kingdom of naples.
some modern authors have argued that he was not from genoa but, instead, from the aragon region of spain or from portugal.
these competing hypotheses have generally been discounted by mainstream scholars.
in 1473, columbus began his apprenticeship as business agent for the important centurione, di negro and spinola families of genoa.
later, he allegedly made a trip to chios, an aegean island then ruled by genoa.
in may 1476, he took part in an armed convoy sent by genoa to carry valuable cargo to northern europe.
he docked in bristol, england and galway, ireland.
a few writers speculate that in 1477, he was in iceland.
it is known that in the autumn of 1477, he sailed on a portuguese ship from galway to lisbon, where he found his brother bartolomeo, and they continued trading for the centurione family.
columbus based himself in lisbon from 1477 to 1485. he married filipa moniz perestrelo, daughter of the porto santo governor and portuguese nobleman of lombard origin bartolomeu perestrello.
in 1479 or 1480, his son diego columbus was born.
between 1482 and 1485, columbus traded along the coasts of west africa, reaching the portuguese trading post of elmina at the guinea coast (in present-day ghana).
some records report that filipa died sometime around 1485, while columbus was away in castile.
he returned to portugal to settle her estate and take his son diego with him.
he had left portugal for castile in 1485, where he found a mistress in 1487, a 20-year-old orphan named beatriz enríquez de arana.
it is likely that beatriz met columbus when he was in córdoba, a gathering site of many genoese merchants and where the court of the catholic monarchs was located at intervals.
beatriz, unmarried at the time, gave birth to columbus's natural son fernando columbus in july 1488, named for the monarch of aragón.
columbus recognized the boy as his offspring.
columbus entrusted his older, legitimate son diego to take care of beatriz and pay the pension set aside for her following his death, but diego was negligent in his duties.
ambitious, columbus eventually learned latin, portuguese, and castilian.
he read widely about astronomy, geography, and history, including the works of claudius ptolemy, cardinal pierre d'ailly's imago mundi, the travels of marco polo and sir john mandeville, pliny's natural history, and pope pius ii's historia rerum ubique gestarum.
according to historian edmund morgan,.mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0}
columbus was not a scholarly man.
yet he studied these books, made hundreds of marginal notations in them and came out with ideas about the world that were characteristically simple and strong and sometimes wrong, ...
throughout his life, columbus also showed a keen interest in the bible and in biblical prophecies, often quoting biblical texts in his letters and logs.
for example, part of the argument that he submitted to the spanish catholic monarchs when he sought their support for his proposed expedition to reach the indies by sailing west was based on his reading of the second book of esdras (ezra): see 2 esdras 6:42, which he took to mean that the earth is made of six parts of land to one of water.
towards the end of his life, he produced a book of prophecies in which his career as an explorer is interpreted in the light of christian eschatology and of apocalypticism.
carol delaney has argued that columbus was a millennialist and that these beliefs motivated his quest for asia in a variety of ways.
columbus wrote often about seeking gold in the diaries of his voyages and writes about acquiring the precious metal “in such quantity that the sovereigns…will undertake and prepare to go conquer the holy sepulcher”  comparative studies in society and history.
april, 2006. in an account of his fourth voyage, columbus wrote that “jerusalem and mount sion must be rebuilt by christian hands”.
it has also been written that “conversion of all people to the christian faith” is a central theme in columbus's writings which is a central tenet of some millenarian beliefs.
in a more specific identification of his motivations, hamandi writes that the “deliverance of jerusalem from muslim hands” could be accomplished by “using the resources of newly discovered lands”.
under the mongol empire's hegemony over asia (the pax mongolica, or mongol peace), europeans had long enjoyed a safe land passage, the silk road, to the indies (then construed roughly as all of south and east asia) and china, which were sources of valuable goods such as spices and silk.
with the fall of constantinople to the ottoman turks in 1453, the land route to asia became much more difficult and dangerous.
portuguese navigators tried to find a sea way to asia.
in 1470, the florentine astronomer paolo dal pozzo toscanelli suggested to king afonso v of portugal that sailing west across the atlantic would be a quicker way to reach the spice islands, cathay, and cipangu than the route around africa, but afonso rejected his proposal.
in 1474, toscanelli sent columbus a map with the notion of a westward route to asia.
in the 1480s, the columbus brothers proposed a plan to reach the indies by sailing west across the "ocean sea" (the atlantic).
however, this was complicated by the opening of the southeast passage to asia around africa by bartolomeu dias in 1488, when he reached the cape of good hope (modern-day south africa).
washington irving's 1828 biography of columbus popularized the idea that columbus had difficulty obtaining support for his plan because many catholic theologians insisted that the earth was flat.
in fact, nearly all educated westerners had understood, at least since the time of aristotle, that the earth is spherical.
the sphericity of the earth is also accounted for in the work of ptolemy, on which medieval astronomy was largely based.
christian writers whose works clearly reflect the conviction that the earth is spherical include saint bede the venerable in his reckoning of time, written around ad 723. in columbus's time, the techniques of celestial navigation, which use the position of the sun and the stars in the sky, together with the understanding that the earth is a sphere, had long been in use by astronomers and were beginning to be implemented by mariners.
as far back as the 3rd century bc, eratosthenes had correctly computed the circumference of the earth by using simple geometry and studying the shadows cast by objects at two remote locations.
in the 1st century bc, posidonius confirmed eratosthenes's results by comparing stellar observations at two separate locations.
these measurements were widely known among scholars, but confusion about the old-fashioned units of distance in which they were expressed led to some debate about the size of the earth.
[citation needed]
from pierre d'ailly's imago mundi columbus learned of alfraganus's estimate that a degree of latitude (or a degree of longitude along the equator) spanned 56​2⁄3 arabic miles (which works out to 66.2 nautical miles (122.6 km)), but did not realize that this was expressed in the arabic mile rather than the shorter roman mile with which he was familiar.
he therefore would have estimated the circumference of the earth to be about 30,200 kilometres (16,300 nmi) at the equator and 26,200 kilometres (14,100 nmi) at 30 degrees north (around where he was sailing), whereas the correct value is 40,075 kilometres (21,639 nmi) at the equator and 34,735 kilometres (18,755 nmi) at 30 degrees north.
[citation needed]
furthermore, most scholars accepted ptolemy's estimate that eurasia spanned 180° longitude, rather than the actual 130° (to the chinese mainland) or 150° (to japan at the latitude of spain).
columbus, for his part, believed an even higher estimate, leaving a smaller percentage for water.
some people have suggested he followed the estimate of marinus of tyre, which put the longitudinal span of the eurasian landmass at 225°.
[citation needed]  other people have suggested he followed esdras's statement that "six parts [of the globe] are habitable and the seventh is covered with water."
he also believed that japan (which he called "cipangu", following marco polo) was much larger, farther to the east from china ("cathay"), and closer to the equator than it is, and that there were inhabited islands even farther to the east than japan, including the mythical antillia, which he thought might lie not much farther to the west than the azores.
in this, he was influenced by the ideas of toscanelli.
columbus therefore would have estimated the distance from the canary islands west to japan to be about 9,800 kilometres (5,300 nmi) or 3,700 kilometres (2,000 nmi), depending on which estimate he used for eurasia's longitudinal span.
the true figure is now known to be vastly larger: about 20,000 kilometres (11,000 nmi).
[c] no ship in the 15th century could have carried enough food and fresh water for such a long voyage, and the dangers involved in navigating through the uncharted ocean would have been formidable.
most european navigators reasonably concluded that a westward voyage from europe to asia was unfeasible.
the catholic monarchs, however, having completed an expensive war in the iberian peninsula, were eager to obtain a competitive edge over other european countries in the quest for trade with the indies.
columbus's project, though far-fetched, held the promise of such an advantage.
[citation needed]
though columbus was wrong about the number of degrees of longitude that separated europe from the far east and about the distance that each degree represented, he did possess valuable knowledge about the trade winds, which would prove to be the key to his successful navigation of the atlantic ocean.
during his first voyage in 1492, the brisk trade winds from the east, commonly called "easterlies", propelled columbus's fleet for five weeks, from the canary islands to the bahamas.
the precise first land sighting and landing point was san salvador island.
to return to spain against this prevailing wind would have required several months of an arduous sailing technique, called beating, during which food and drinkable water would probably have been exhausted.
instead, columbus returned home by following the curving trade winds northeastward to the middle latitudes of the north atlantic, where he was able to catch the "westerlies" that blow eastward to the coast of western europe.
there, in turn, the winds curve southward towards the iberian peninsula.
it is unclear whether columbus learned about the winds from his own sailing experience or if he had heard about them from others.
the corresponding technique for efficient travel in the atlantic appears to have been exploited first by the portuguese, who referred to it as the volta do mar ("turn of the sea").
columbus's knowledge of the atlantic wind patterns was, however, imperfect at the time of his first voyage.
by sailing directly due west from the canary islands during hurricane season, skirting the so-called horse latitudes of the mid-atlantic, columbus risked either being becalmed or running into a tropical cyclone, both of which, by chance, he avoided.
in 1485, columbus presented his plans to king john ii of portugal.
he proposed that the king equip three sturdy ships and grant columbus one year's time to sail out into the atlantic, search for a western route to the orient, and return.
columbus also requested he be made "great admiral of the ocean", appointed governor of any and all lands he discovered, and given one-tenth of all revenue from those lands.
the king submitted columbus's proposal to his experts, who rejected it.
it was their considered opinion that columbus's estimation of a travel distance of 2,400 miles (3,860 km) was, in fact, far too low.
in 1488, columbus again appealed to the court of portugal, resulting in john ii again inviting him for an audience.
that meeting also proved unsuccessful, in part because not long afterwards bartolomeu dias returned to portugal with news of his successful rounding of the southern tip of africa (near the cape of good hope).
with an eastern sea route to asia apparently at hand, king john was no longer interested in columbus's far-fetched project.
columbus traveled from portugal to both genoa and venice, but he received encouragement from neither.
he had also dispatched his brother bartholomew to the court of henry vii of england to inquire whether the english crown might sponsor his expedition, but also without success.
columbus had sought an audience from the monarchs ferdinand ii of aragon and isabella i of castile, who had united several kingdoms in the iberian peninsula by marrying and were ruling together.
on 1 may 1486, permission having been granted, columbus presented his plans to queen isabella, who, in turn, referred it to a committee.
after the passing of much time, the savants of spain, like their counterparts in portugal, replied that columbus had grossly underestimated the distance to asia.
they pronounced the idea impractical and advised their royal highnesses to pass on the proposed venture.
however, to keep columbus from taking his ideas elsewhere, and perhaps to keep their options open, the catholic monarchs gave him an annual allowance of 12,000 maravedis and, in 1489, furnished him with a letter ordering all cities and towns under their domain to provide him food and lodging at no cost.
after continually lobbying at the spanish court and two years of negotiations, he finally had success in january 1492. ferdinand and isabella had just conquered granada, the last muslim stronghold on the iberian peninsula, and they received columbus in córdoba, in the alcázar castle.
isabella turned him down on the advice of her confessor.
columbus was leaving town by mule in despair when ferdinand intervened.
isabella then sent a royal guard to fetch him, and ferdinand later claimed credit for being "the principal cause why those islands were discovered".
in the april 1492 "capitulations of santa fe", king ferdinand and queen isabella promised columbus that if he succeeded he would be given the rank of admiral of the ocean sea and appointed viceroy and governor of all the new lands he could claim for spain.
he had the right to nominate three persons, from whom the sovereigns would choose one, for any office in the new lands.
he would be entitled to 10 percent of all the revenues from the new lands in perpetuity.
additionally, he would also have the option of buying one-eighth interest in any commercial venture with the new lands and receive one-eighth of the profits.
columbus was later arrested in 1500 and dismissed from his posts.
he and his sons, diego and fernando, then conducted a lengthy series of court cases against the castilian crown, known as the pleitos colombinos, alleging that the crown had illegally reneged on its contractual obligations to columbus and his heirs.
the columbus family had some success in their first litigation, as a judgment of 1511 confirmed diego's position as viceroy, but reduced his powers.
diego resumed litigation in 1512, which lasted until 1536, and further disputes continued until 1790.
between 1492 and 1503, columbus completed four round-trip voyages between spain and the americas, each voyage being sponsored by the crown of castile.
on his first voyage, he independently discovered the americas and magnetic declination.
[d] these voyages marked the beginning of the european exploration and colonization of the american continents, and are thus of enormous significance in western history.
columbus always insisted, in the face of mounting evidence to the contrary, that the lands that he visited during those voyages were part of the asian continent, as previously described by marco polo and other european travelers.
columbus's refusal to accept that the lands he had visited and claimed for spain were not part of asia might explain, in part, why the american continent was named after the florentine explorer amerigo vespucci and not after columbus.
on the evening of 3 august 1492, columbus departed from palos de la frontera with three ships.
the largest was a carrack (spanish: nao), the santa maría ex-gallega ("galician")[further explanation needed].
the other two were smaller caravels.
the name of one is lost: it is known today only by the nickname pinta, which in castilian of the time meant "painted one".
the santa clara was nicknamed affectionately the niña ("the little one"), a pun on the name of her owner, juan niño of moguer.
the monarchs forced the citizens of palos to contribute to the expedition.
the santa maría was owned by juan de la cosa and captained by columbus.
the pinta and the niña were piloted by the pinzón brothers (martín alonso and vicente yáñez).
columbus first sailed to the canary islands, which belonged to castile.
he restocked provisions and made repairs in gran canaria, then departed from san sebastián de la gomera on 6 september, for what turned out to be a five-week voyage across the ocean.
at about 2:00 in the morning of 12 october (21 october, gregorian calendar new style), a lookout on the pinta, rodrigo de triana (also known as juan rodríguez bermeo), spotted land, and immediately alerted the rest of the crew with a shout.
thereupon, the captain of the pinta, martín alonso pinzón, verified the sight of land and alerted columbus by firing a lombard.
columbus later maintained that he himself had already seen a light on the land a few hours earlier, thereby claiming for himself the lifetime pension promised by ferdinand and isabella to the first person to sight land.
columbus called the island (in what is now the bahamas) san salvador (meaning "holy savior"); the natives called it guanahani.
exactly which island in the bahamas this corresponds to is unresolved.
based on primary accounts and the geographic positions of the islands given columbus's course, the prime candidates are san salvador island (so named in 1925 on the theory that it was columbus's san salvador), samana cay, and plana cays.
the indigenous people he encountered, the lucayan, taíno, and arawak, were peaceful and friendly.
he called the inhabitants of the lands that he visited indios (spanish for "indians").
noting their gold ear ornaments, columbus took some of the arawaks prisoner and insisted that they guide him to the source of the gold.
from the entry in his journal of 12 october 1492, in which he wrote of them: "many of the men i have seen have scars on their bodies, and when i made signs to them to find out how this happened, they indicated that people from other nearby islands come to san salvador to capture them; they defend themselves the best they can.
i believe that people from the mainland come here to take them as slaves.
they ought to make good and skilled servants, for they repeat very quickly whatever we say to them.
i think they can very easily be made christians, for they seem to have no religion.
if it pleases our lord, i will take six of them to your highnesses when i depart, in order that they may learn our language."
columbus noted that their primitive weapons and military tactics made them susceptible to easy conquest, writing, "these people are very simple in war-like matters … i could conquer the whole of them with 50 men, and govern them as i pleased."
columbus also explored the northeast coast of cuba, where he landed on 28 october.
on 22 november, martín alonso pinzón took the pinta on an unauthorized expedition in search of an island called "babeque" or "baneque", which the natives had told him was rich in gold.
columbus, for his part, continued to the northern coast of hispaniola, where he landed on 5 december.
there, the santa maría ran aground on christmas day 1492 and had to be abandoned.
the wreck was used as a target for cannon fire to impress the native peoples.
columbus was received by the native cacique guacanagari, who gave him permission to leave some of his men behind.
columbus left 39 men, including luis de torres, the converso interpreter, who spoke hebrew and arabic,[citation needed] and founded the settlement of la navidad at the site of present-day bord de mer de limonade, haiti.
columbus took more natives prisoner and continued his exploration.
he kept sailing along the northern coast of hispaniola with a single ship, until he encountered pinzón and the pinta on 6 january.
on 13 january 1493, columbus made his last stop of this voyage in the new world, in the bay of rincón at the eastern end of the samaná peninsula in northeast hispaniola.
there he encountered the warlike cigüayos, the only natives who offered violent resistance during his first voyage to the americas.
the cigüayos refused to trade the amount of bows and arrows that columbus desired; in the ensuing clash one ciguayo was stabbed in the buttocks and another wounded with an arrow in his chest.
because of this and because of the cigüayos' use of arrows, he called the inlet where he met them the bay of arrows (or gulf of arrows).
columbus captured about 10 to 25 natives and took them back with him (only seven or eight of the natives arrived in spain alive).
columbus headed for spain on the niña, but a storm separated him from the pinta, and forced the niña to stop at the island of santa maria in the azores.
half of his crew went ashore to say prayers in a chapel to give thanks for having survived the storm.
but while praying, they were imprisoned by the governor of the island, ostensibly on suspicion of being pirates.
after a two-day standoff, the prisoners were released, and columbus again set sail for spain.
another storm forced him into the port at lisbon.
he anchored next to the king's harbor patrol ship on 4 march 1493 in portugal.
there, he was interviewed by bartolomeu dias, who had rounded the cape of good hope a few years earlier, in 1488–1489.
dias's success had complicated columbus's attempts to secure funding from the portuguese court because the sure route to the indies that dias pioneered made a risky, conjectural western route unnecessary.
not finding king john ii of portugal in lisbon, columbus wrote a letter to him and waited for john's reply.
john asked columbus to go to vale do paraíso north of lisbon to meet him.
relations between portugal and castile were poor at the time.
columbus went to meet with john at vale do paraíso.
hearing of columbus's voyage, john told him that he believed the voyage to be in violation of the 1479 treaty of alcáçovas.
after spending more than a week in portugal, and paying his respects to eleanor of viseu, columbus again set sail for spain.
ferdinand magellan was a young boy and a ward of eleanor's court; it is likely he saw columbus during this visit.
after departing, and after reportedly being saved from assassins by king john, columbus crossed the bar of saltes and entered the harbor of palos de la frontera on 15 march 1493. word of his finding new lands rapidly spread throughout europe.
columbus left the port of cádiz on 24 september 1493, with a fleet of 17 ships carrying 1,200 men and the supplies to establish permanent colonies in the new world.
the passengers included priests, farmers, and soldiers, who would be the new colonists.
this reflected the new policy of creating not just "colonies of exploitation", but also "colonies of settlement" from which to launch missions dedicated to converting the natives to christianity.
modern studies suggest that "crew members may have included free black africans who arrived in the new world about a decade before the slave trade began".
as in the first voyage, the fleet stopped at the canary islands, from which it departed on 13 october, following a more southerly course than on the previous expedition.
on 3 november, columbus sighted a rugged island that he named dominica (latin for sunday); later that day, he landed at marie-galante, which he named santa maría la galante.
after sailing past les saintes (los santos, "the saints"), he arrived at the island of guadeloupe, which he named santa maría de guadalupe de extremadura, after the image of the virgin mary venerated at the spanish monastery of villuercas, in guadalupe, cáceres, spain.
he explored that island from 4 to 10 november.
michele da cuneo, columbus's childhood friend from savona, sailed with columbus during the second voyage and wrote: "in my opinion, since genoa was genoa, there was never born a man so well equipped and expert in the art of navigation as the said lord admiral."
columbus named the small island of "saona ... to honor michele da cuneo, his friend from savona."
the same childhood friend reported in a letter that columbus had provided one of the captured indigenous women to him.
he wrote, "while i was in the boat, i captured a very beautiful carib woman, whom the said lord admiral gave to me.
when i had taken her to my cabin she was naked—as was their custom.
i was filled with a desire to take my pleasure with her and attempted to satisfy my desire.
she was unwilling, and so treated me with her nails that i wished i had never begun.
but—to cut a long story short—i then took a piece of rope and whipped her soundly, and she let forth such incredible screams that you would not have believed your ears.
eventually we came to such terms, i assure you, that you would have thought that she had been brought up in a school for whores."
pedro de las casas, father of the priest bartolomé de las casas, also accompanied columbus on this voyage.
the exact course of columbus's voyage through the lesser antilles is debated, but it seems likely that he turned north, sighting and naming several islands, including:
columbus also sighted the chain of the virgin islands, which he named islas de santa úrsula y las once mil vírgenes, "islands of saint ursula and the 11,000 virgins" (shortened, both on maps of the time and in common parlance, to islas vírgenes).
he also named the islands of virgin gorda ("fat virgin"), tortola, and peter island (san pedro).
one of the first skirmishes between native americans and europeans since the time of the vikings occurred on 14 november, when at saint croix, columbus's men rescued two native boys from several cannibalistic island caribs.
columbus's men pursued the carib canoe, which met them with arrows.
several europeans were wounded, but they killed all of the caribs, and learned that the two boys had recently been castrated by their captors.
columbus continued to the virgin islands, and landed in puerto rico, which he named san juan bautista in honor of saint john the baptist (a name that was later given to the capital city of san juan).
on 22 november, columbus returned to hispaniola, where he intended to visit the fort of la navidad, built during his first voyage and located on the northern coast of haiti.
columbus found the fort in ruins, destroyed by the native taino people.
among the ruins were the corpses of 11 of the 39 spaniards who had stayed behind as the first colonists in the new world.
columbus then sailed more than 100 kilometres (62 miles) eastwards along the northern coast of hispaniola, establishing a new settlement, which he called la isabela, in the present-day dominican republic.
however, la isabela proved to be poorly located and the settlement was short-lived.
according to the abstract of columbus's journal made by bartolomé de las casas, the objective of the third voyage was to verify the existence of a continent that king john ii of portugal suggested was located to the southwest of the cape verde islands.
king john reportedly knew of the existence of such a mainland because "canoes had been found which set out from the coast of guinea [west africa] and sailed to the west with merchandise."
on 30 may 1498, columbus left with six ships from sanlúcar, spain, for his third trip to the new world.
three of the ships headed directly for hispaniola with much-needed supplies, while columbus took the other three in an exploration of what might lie to the south of the caribbean islands he had already visited, including a hoped-for passage to continental asia.
columbus led his fleet to the portuguese island of porto santo, his wife's native land.
he then sailed to madeira and spent some time there with the portuguese captain joão gonçalves da camara, before sailing to the canary islands and cape verde.
as he crossed the atlantic, columbus discovered that the angle between north as indicated by a magnetic compass and north as measured by the position of the pole star changed with his position (a phenomenon now known as "compass variation").
he would later use his previous measurements of the compass variation to adjust his reckoning.
after being becalmed for several days in the doldrums of the mid-atlantic, columbus's fleet regained its wind and, dangerously low on water, turned north in the direction of dominica, which columbus had visited in his previous voyage.
the ships arrived at king john's hypothesized continent, which is south america, when they sighted the land of trinidad on 31 july approaching from the southeast.
the fleet sailed along the southern coast and entered dragon's mouth, anchoring near soldado rock where they made contact with a group of native amerindians in canoes.
columbus then landed on trinidad at icacos point (which he named punta de arenal) on 2 august.
after resupplying with food and water, from 4 to 12 august columbus explored the gulf of paria, which separates trinidad from what is now venezuela, near the delta of the orinoco river.
he then touched the mainland of south america at the paria peninsula.
[citation needed]
exploring the new continent, columbus correctly interpreted the enormous quantity of fresh water that the orinoco delivered into the atlantic ocean as evidence that he had reached a large landmass rather than another island.
he also speculated that the new continent might be the location of the biblical garden of eden.
he then sailed to the islands of chacachacare and margarita.
he sighted tobago (which he named "bella forma") and grenada (which he named "concepción").
in poor health, columbus returned to hispaniola on 19 august, only to find that many of the spanish settlers of the new colony were in rebellion against his rule, claiming that columbus had misled them about the supposedly bountiful riches of the new world.
a number of returning settlers and sailors lobbied against columbus at the spanish court, accusing him and his brothers of gross mismanagement.
columbus had some of his crew hanged for disobedience.
he had an economic interest in the enslavement of the hispaniola natives and for that reason was not eager to baptize them, which attracted criticism from some churchmen.
an entry in his journal from september 1498 reads: "from here one might send, in the name of the holy trinity, as many slaves as could be sold ..."
columbus was eventually forced to make peace with the rebellious colonists on humiliating terms.
in 1500, the crown had him removed as governor, arrested, and transported in chains to spain (see "accusations of tyranny" section below).
he was eventually freed and allowed to return to the new world, but not as governor.
[citation needed]
before leaving for his fourth voyage, columbus wrote a letter to the governors of the bank of saint george, genoa, dated at seville, 2 april 1502. he wrote "although my body is here my heart is always near you."
columbus made a fourth voyage nominally in search of the strait of malacca to the indian ocean.
accompanied by his brother bartolomeo and his 13-year-old son fernando, he left cádiz on 11 may 1502, with his flagship santa maría and the vessels gallega, vizcaína, and santiago de palos.
he sailed to arzila on the moroccan coast to rescue portuguese soldiers whom he had heard were under siege by the moors.
on 15 june, they landed at carbet on the island of martinique (martinica).
a hurricane was brewing, so he continued on, hoping to find shelter on hispaniola.
he arrived at santo domingo on 29 june, but was denied port, and the new governor refused to listen to his storm prediction.
instead, while columbus's ships sheltered at the mouth of the rio jaina, the first spanish treasure fleet sailed into the hurricane.
columbus's ships survived with only minor damage, while 29 of the 30 ships in the governor's fleet were lost to a storm on 1 july.
in addition to the ships, 500 lives (including that of the governor, francisco de bobadilla) and an immense cargo of gold were surrendered to the sea.
after a brief stop at jamaica, columbus sailed to central america, arriving at guanaja (isla de pinos) in the bay islands off the coast of honduras on 30 july.
here bartolomeo found native merchants and a large canoe, which was described as being "long as a galley" and filled with cargo.
on 14 august, he landed on the continental mainland at puerto castilla, near trujillo, honduras.
he spent two months exploring the coasts of honduras, nicaragua, and costa rica, before arriving in almirante bay in panama on 16 october.
on 5 december 1502, columbus and his crew found themselves in a storm unlike any they had ever experienced.
in his journal columbus writes,
for nine days i was as one lost, without hope of life.
eyes never beheld the sea so angry, so high, so covered with foam.
the wind not only prevented our progress, but offered no opportunity to run behind any headland for shelter; hence we were forced to keep out in this bloody ocean, seething like a pot on a hot fire.
never did the sky look more terrible; for one whole day and night it blazed like a furnace, and the lightning broke with such violence that each time i wondered if it had carried off my spars and sails; the flashes came with such fury and frightfulness that we all thought that the ship would be blasted.
all this time the water never ceased to fall from the sky; i do not say it rained, for it was like another deluge.
the men were so worn out that they longed for death to end their dreadful suffering.
in panama, columbus learned from the ngobe of gold and a strait to another ocean, but was told by local leader quibían not to go past a certain point down the river.
after much exploration, in january 1503, he established a garrison at the mouth of the belén river.
on 6 april, one of the ships became stranded in the river.
at the same time, the garrison was attacked by quibían and the other ships were damaged.
shipworms also damaged the ships in tropical waters.
columbus left for hispaniola on 16 april heading north.
on 10 may he sighted the cayman islands, naming them "las tortugas" after the numerous sea turtles there.
his ships next sustained more damage in a storm off the coast of cuba.
unable to travel farther, on 25 june 1503 they were beached in st. ann's bay, jamaica.
for one year columbus and his men remained stranded on jamaica.
a spaniard, diego méndez, and some natives paddled a canoe to get help from hispaniola.
the governor, nicolás de ovando y cáceres, detested columbus and obstructed all efforts to rescue him and his men.
in the meantime columbus, in a desperate effort to induce the natives to continue provisioning him and his hungry men, won their favor by predicting a lunar eclipse for 29 february 1504, using abraham zacuto's astronomical charts.
help finally arrived, no thanks to the governor, on 29 june 1504, and columbus and his men arrived in sanlúcar, spain, on 7 november.
following his first voyage, columbus was appointed viceroy and governor of the indies under the terms of the capitulations of santa fe.
in practice, this primarily entailed the administration of the colonies in the island of hispaniola, whose capital was established in santo domingo.
by the end of his third voyage, columbus was physically and mentally exhausted, his body wracked by arthritis and his eyes by ophthalmia.
in october 1499, he sent two ships to spain, asking the court of spain to appoint a royal commissioner to help him govern.
[citation needed]
by this time, accusations of tyranny and incompetence on the part of columbus had also reached the court.
queen isabella and king ferdinand responded by removing columbus from power and replacing him with francisco de bobadilla, a member of the order of calatrava.
bobadilla, who ruled as governor from 1500 until his death in a storm in 1502, had also been tasked by the court with investigating the accusations of brutality made against columbus.
arriving in santo domingo while columbus was away during the explorations of his third voyage, bobadilla was immediately met with complaints about all three columbus brothers: christopher, bartolomeo, and diego.
bobadilla reported to spain that columbus regularly used torture and mutilation to govern hispaniola.
the 48-page report, found in 2006 in the national archive in the spanish city of simancas, contains testimonies from 23 people, including both enemies and supporters of columbus, about the treatment of colonial subjects by columbus and his brothers during his seven-year rule.
according to the report, columbus once punished a man found guilty of stealing corn by having his ears and nose cut off and then selling him into slavery.
testimony recorded in the report stated that columbus congratulated his brother bartolomeo on "defending the family" when the latter ordered a woman paraded naked through the streets and then had her tongue cut out for suggesting that columbus was of lowly birth.
the document also describes how columbus put down native unrest and revolt: he first ordered a brutal crackdown in which many natives were killed, and then paraded their dismembered bodies through the streets in an attempt to discourage further rebellion.
"columbus's government was characterised by a form of tyranny," consuelo varela, a spanish historian who has seen the document, told journalists.
"even those who loved him had to admit the atrocities that had taken place."
because of their gross misgovernance, columbus and his brothers were arrested and imprisoned upon their return to spain from the third voyage.
they lingered in jail for six weeks before king ferdinand ordered their release.
not long after, the king and queen summoned the columbus brothers to the alhambra palace in granada.
there, the royal couple heard the brothers' pleas; restored their freedom and wealth; and, after much persuasion, agreed to fund columbus's fourth voyage.
but the door was firmly shut on columbus's role as governor.
henceforth nicolás de ovando y cáceres was to be the new governor of the west indies.
columbus had always claimed the conversion of non-believers as one reason for his explorations, but he grew increasingly religious in his later years.
probably with the assistance of his son diego and his friend the carthusian monk gaspar gorricio, columbus produced two books during his later years: a book of privileges (1502), detailing and documenting the rewards from the spanish crown to which he believed he and his heirs were entitled, and a book of prophecies (1505), in which he considered his achievements as an explorer but a fulfillment of bible prophecy in the context of christian eschatology.
in his later years, columbus demanded that the spanish crown give him 10 percent of all profits made in the new lands, as stipulated in the capitulations of santa fe.
because he had been relieved of his duties as governor, the crown did not feel bound by that contract and his demands were rejected.
after his death, his heirs sued the crown for a part of the profits from trade with america, as well as other rewards.
this led to a protracted series of legal disputes known as the pleitos colombinos ("columbian lawsuits").
during a violent storm on his first return voyage, columbus, then 41, suffered an attack of what was believed at the time to be gout.
in subsequent years, he was plagued with what was thought to be influenza and other fevers, bleeding from the eyes, temporary blindness and prolonged attacks of gout.
the attacks increased in duration and severity, sometimes leaving columbus bedridden for months at a time, and culminated in his death 14 years later.
based on columbus's lifestyle and the described symptoms, modern doctors suspect that he suffered from reactive arthritis, rather than gout.
reactive arthritis is a joint inflammation caused by intestinal bacterial infections or after acquiring certain sexually transmitted diseases (primarily chlamydia or gonorrhea).
"it seems likely that [columbus] acquired reactive arthritis from food poisoning on one of his ocean voyages because of poor sanitation and improper food preparation," writes dr. frank c. arnett, a rheumatologist and professor of internal medicine, pathology and laboratory medicine the university of texas medical school at houston.
on 20 may 1506, aged probably 54, columbus died in valladolid, spain.
his remains were first interred at valladolid, then at the monastery of la cartuja in seville (southern spain) by the will of his son diego colón, who had been governor of hispaniola.
in 1542, the remains were transferred to colonial santo domingo, in the present-day dominican republic.
in 1795, when france took over the entire island of hispaniola, columbus's remains were moved to havana, cuba.
after cuba became independent following the spanish–american war in 1898, the remains were moved back to spain, to the cathedral of seville, where they were placed on an elaborate catafalque.
however, a lead box bearing an inscription identifying "don christopher columbus" and containing bone fragments and a bullet was discovered at santo domingo in 1877. these bones were considered legitimate by physician and future united states assistant secretary of state john eugene osborne, who suggested in 1913 that the remains be placed on a battleship and travel through the panama canal as a part of its opening ceremony.
ultimately, it was decided not to do so.
to lay to rest claims that the wrong relics had been moved to havana and that columbus's remains had been left buried in the cathedral of santo domingo, dna samples of the corpse resting in seville were taken in june 2003 (history today august 2003) as well as other dna samples from the remains of his brother diego and younger son fernando colón.
initial observations suggested that the bones did not appear to belong to somebody with the physique or age at death associated with columbus.
dna extraction proved difficult; only short fragments of mitochondrial dna could be isolated.
the mitochondrial dna fragments matched corresponding dna from columbus's brother, giving support that both individuals had shared the same mother.
such evidence, together with anthropologic and historic analyses, led the researchers to conclude that the remains found in seville belonged to christopher columbus.
the authorities in santo domingo have never allowed the remains there to be exhumed, so it is unknown if any of those remains could be from columbus's body as well.
the dominican remains are located in "the columbus lighthouse" (faro a colón), in santo domingo.
the anniversary of columbus's 1492 landing in the americas is usually observed on 12 october in spain and throughout the americas, except canada.
in spain it is called the fiesta nacional de españa y día de la hispanidad, while a number of countries in latin america celebrate it as día de la raza.
in the united states it is called columbus day and is observed annually on the second monday in october.
there are efforts in the us to rename columbus day as indigenous peoples' day.
historically, the english had downplayed columbus and emphasized the role of the venetian john cabot as a pioneer explorer, but for the emerging united states, cabot made for a poor national hero.
veneration of columbus in america dates back to colonial times.
the name columbia for "america" first appeared in a 1738 weekly publication of the debates of the british parliament.
the use of columbus as a founding figure of new world nations and the use of the word "columbia", or simply the name "columbus", spread rapidly after the american revolution.
columbus's name was given to the federal capital of the united states (district of columbia), the capital cities of two u.s. states (ohio and south carolina), and the columbia river.
outside the united states the name was used in 1819 for the gran colombia, a precursor of the modern republic of colombia.
numerous cities, towns, counties, streets, and plazas (called plaza colón or plaza de colón throughout latin america and spain) have been named after him.
a candidate for sainthood in the catholic church in 1866, celebration of columbus's legacy perhaps reached a zenith in 1892 with the 400th anniversary of his first arrival in the americas.
monuments to columbus like the columbian exposition in chicago and columbus circle in new york city were erected throughout the united states and latin america extolling him.
the world columbian exposition in chicago, 1893, commemorated the 400th anniversary of the landing of christopher columbus in the americas.
over 27 million people attended the exposition during its six-month duration.
the united states postal service participated in the celebration issuing the first us commemorative postage stamps, a series of 16 postage issues called the columbian issue depicting columbus, queen isabella and others in the various stages of his several voyages.
the issues range in value from the 1-cent to the 5-dollar denominations.
under benjamin harrison and his postmaster general john wanamaker the columbian commemorative stamps were made available and were first issued at the world columbian exposition in chicago, illinois, in 1893. wanamaker originally introduced the idea of issuing the nation's first commemorative stamp to harrison, the congress and the u.s. post office.
to demonstrate his confidence in the new columbian commemorative issues wanamaker purchased $10,000 worth of stamps with his own money.
the columbian exposition lasted several months, and over $40 million in commemorative postage stamps had been sold.
the 400th anniversary columbian issues were very popular in the united states.
a total of two billion stamps were issued for all the columbian denominations, and 72 percent of these were the two-cent stamps, "landing of columbus", which paid the first-class rate for domestic mail at the time.
in 1992, a second columbian issue was released that was identical to the first to commemorate the 500th anniversary, except for the date in the upper right hand corner of each stamp.
these issues were made from the original dies of which the first engraved issues of 1893 were produced.
the united states issued the series jointly for the first time with three other countries, italy in lire, portugal in escudos and spain in pesetas.
in 1909, descendants of columbus undertook to dismantle the columbus family chapel in spain and move it to boalsburg near state college, pennsylvania, where it may now be visited by the public.
at the museum associated with the chapel, there are a number of columbus relics worthy of note, including the armchair that the "admiral of the ocean sea" used at his chart table.
columbus's voyages are considered some of the most important events in world history, kickstarting modern globalism and resulting in major demographic, commercial, economic, social, and political changes.
these explorations resulted in the permanent contact between the two hemispheres.
there was a massive exchange of animals, plants, fungi, diseases, technologies, mineral wealth and ideas.
exposed to old world diseases, the indigenous populations of the new world collapsed and were largely replaced by europeans and africans who brought with them new methods of farming, business, governance, and religious worship.
though christopher columbus came to be considered the discoverer of america in us and european popular culture, his historical legacy is more nuanced.
america had been discovered and populated by its indigenous population.
columbus was not even the first european to reach its shores, having been preceded by erik the red in 10th-century greenland and leif erikson in 11th-century vinland at l'anse aux meadows.
however, columbus's efforts brought the americas to the attention of europe at a time ripe for europe to act upon.
thus, columbus was able to initiate the enduring association between the earth's two major landmasses and their inhabitants.
"columbus's claim to fame isn't that he got there first," explains historian martin dugard, "it's that he stayed."
historians have traditionally argued that columbus remained convinced to the very end that his journeys had been along the east coast of asia, but writer kirkpatrick sale argues that a document in the book of privileges indicates columbus knew he found a new continent.
furthermore, his journals from the third voyage call the "land of paria" a "hitherto unknown" continent.
on the other hand, his other writings continued to claim that he had reached asia, such as a 1502 letter to pope alexander vi where he asserted that cuba was the east coast of asia.
he also rationalized that the new continent of south america was the "earthly paradise" that was located "at the end of the orient".
thus, it remains unclear what his true beliefs were.
the term "pre-columbian" is usually used to refer to the peoples and cultures of the americas before the arrival of columbus and his european successors.
columbus is often credited with refuting a prevalent belief in a flat earth.
however, this legacy is a popular misconception.
to the contrary, the spherical shape of the earth had been known to scholars since antiquity, and was common knowledge among sailors.
coincidentally, the oldest surviving globe of the earth, the erdapfel, was made in 1492, just before columbus's return to europe.
as such it contains no sign of the americas and yet demonstrates the common belief in a spherical earth.
the scholar amerigo vespucci, who sailed to america in the years following columbus's first voyage, was the first to speculate that the land was not part of asia but in fact constituted some wholly new continent previously unknown to eurasians.
his travel journals, published 1502–04, convinced german cartographer martin waldseemüller to reach the same conclusion, and in 1507—a year after columbus's death—waldseemüller published a world map calling the new continent america from vespucci's latinized name "americus".
according to paul lunde, "the preoccupation of european courts with the rise of the ottoman turks in the east partly explains their relative lack of interest in columbus's discoveries in the west."
since the late 20th century, historians have criticized columbus for initiating colonization and for abuse of natives.
among reasons for this criticism is the poor treatment of the native taíno people of hispaniola, whose population declined rapidly after contact with the spanish.
columbus required the natives to pay tribute in gold and cotton.
modern estimates for the pre-columbian population of hispaniola vary from several hundred thousand to more than a million.
according to the historian gonzalo fernandez de oviedo y valdes, by 1548, 56 years after columbus landed, and 42 years after he died, fewer than 500 taíno were living on the island.
the indigenous population declined rapidly, due primarily to the first pandemic of european endemic diseases, which struck hispaniola after 1519. the natives had no acquired immunity to these new diseases and suffered high fatalities.
there is also documentation that they were overworked.
historian andrés reséndez of university of california, davis, pushes back against this narrative, and says the available evidence suggests "slavery has emerged as major killer" of the indigenous populations of the caribbean between 1492 and 1550 more so than diseases such as smallpox, influenza and malaria.
he says that indigenous populations did not experience a rebound like european populations did following the black death because unlike the latter, the former were subjected to deadly forced labor in gold and silver mines on a massive scale.
the natives of the island were systematically subjugated via the encomienda system implemented by columbus.
adapted to the new world from spain, it resembled the feudal system in medieval europe, as it was based on a lord offering "protection" to a class of people who owed labor.
in addition, spanish colonists under his rule began to buy and sell natives as slaves, including children.
when natives on hispaniola began fighting back against their oppressors in 1495, columbus's men captured 1,500 arawak men, women, and children in a single raid.
the strongest were transported to spain to be sold as slaves; 40 percent of the 500 shipped died en route.
historian james w. loewen asserts that "columbus not only sent the first slaves across the atlantic, he probably sent more slaves—about five thousand—than any other individual."
according to spanish colonist and dominican friar bartolomé de las casas's contemporary a short account of the destruction of the indies, when slaves held in captivity began to die at high rates, columbus ordered all natives over the age of thirteen to pay a hawk's bell full of gold powder every three months.
natives who brought this amount to the spanish were given a copper token to hang around their necks.
the spanish cut off the hands of those without tokens, and left them to bleed to death.
thousands of natives committed suicide by poison to escape their persecution.
columbus' s forced labor system was also described by his son, ferdinand: "in the cibao, where the gold mines were, every person of fourteen years of age or upward was to pay a large hawk's bell of gold dust; all others were each to pay twenty-five pounds of cotton.
whenever an indian delivered his tribute, he was to receive a brass or copper token which he must wear about his neck as proof that he had made his payment; any indian found without such a token was to be punished."
during his brief reign, columbus executed spanish colonists for minor crimes, and used dismemberment as another form of punishment.
when columbus fell ill in 1495, "what little restraint he had maintained over his men disappeared as he went through a lengthy period of recuperation.
the troops went wild, stealing, killing, raping, and torturing natives, trying to force them to divulge the whereabouts of the imagined treasure-houses of gold."
according to las casas, 50,000 natives perished during this period.
upon his recovery, columbus organized his troops' efforts, forming a squadron of several hundred heavily armed men and more than twenty attack dogs.
dogs were used to hunt down natives who attempted to flee.
columbus's men tore across the land, killing thousands of sick and unarmed natives.
soldiers would use their captives for sword practice, attempting to decapitate them or cut them in half with a single blow.
the arawaks attempted to fight back against columbus's men but lacked their armor, guns, swords, and horses.
when taken prisoner, they were hanged or burned to death.
desperation led to mass suicides and infanticide among the natives.
in just two years under columbus's governorship, over 125,000 of the 250,000–300,000 natives in haiti were dead, many died from lethal forced labor in the mines, in which a third of workers died every six months.
within three decades, the surviving arawak population numbered only in the hundreds.
"virtually every member of the gentle race ... had been wiped out."
disease, warfare and harsh enslavement contributed to the depopulation.
within indigenous circles, columbus is often viewed as a key agent of genocide.
samuel eliot morison, a harvard historian and author of a multivolume biography on columbus writes, "the cruel policy initiated by columbus and pursued by his successors resulted in complete genocide."
loewen laments that while "haiti under the spanish is one of the primary instances of genocide in all human history", only one major history text he reviewed mentions columbus's role in it.
some of these accounts may be part of the black legend, an intentional defamation of spain,  while others challenge the genocide narrative.
noble david cook, writing about the black legend and the conquest of the americas wrote, "there were too few spaniards to have killed the millions who were reported to have died in the first century after old and new world contact".
he instead estimates that the death toll was caused by diseases like smallpox, which according to some estimates had an 80–90% fatality rate in native american populations.
disease played a significant role in the destruction of the natives.
indirect evidence suggests that some serious illness may have arrived with the 1500 colonists who accompanied columbus's second expedition in 1493.
by the end of 1494, disease and famine had claimed two-thirds of the spanish settlers.
a native nahuatl account depicted the social breakdown that accompanied the pandemics: "a great many died from this plague, and many others died of hunger.
they could not get up to search for food, and everyone else was too sick to care for them, so they starved to death in their beds."
when the pandemic finally struck in 1519 it wiped out much of the remaining native population.
charles c. mann wrote "it was as if the suffering these diseases had caused in eurasia over the past millennia were concentrated into the span of decades."
some historians have argued that, while brutal, columbus was simply a product of his time, and being a figure of the 15th century, should not be judged by the morality of the 20th century.
although an abundance of artwork involving christopher columbus exists, no authentic contemporary portrait has been found.
james w. loewen, author of lies my teacher told me, believes the various posthumous portraits have no historical value.
sometime between 1531 and 1536, alejo fernández painted an altarpiece, the virgin of the navigators, that includes a depiction of columbus.
the painting was commissioned for a chapel in seville's casa de contratación (house of trade) and remains there, as the earliest known painting about the voyages of columbus.
at the 1893 world's columbian exposition, 71 alleged portraits of columbus were displayed; most did not match contemporary descriptions.
these writings describe him as having reddish or blond hair, which turned to white early in his life, light colored eyes, as well as being a lighter-skinned person with too much sun exposure turning his face red.
accounts consistently describe columbus as a large and physically strong man of some six feet (1.83 metres) or more in height, easily taller than the average european of his day.
the most iconic image of columbus is a portrait by sebastiano del piombo, which has been reproduced in many textbooks.
it agrees with descriptions of columbus in that it shows a large man with auburn hair, but the painting dates from 1519 and cannot, therefore, have been painted from life.
furthermore, the inscription identifying the subject as columbus was probably added later, and the face shown differs from other images, including that of the "virgin of the navigators."

the statue of laocoön and his sons, also called the laocoön group (italian: gruppo del laocoonte), has been one of the most famous ancient sculptures ever since it was excavated in rome in 1506 and placed on public display in the vatican, where it remains.
it is very likely the same statue praised in the highest terms by the main roman writer on art, pliny the elder.
the figures are near life-size and the group is a little over 2 m (6 ft 7 in) in height, showing the trojan priest laocoön and his sons antiphantes and thymbraeus being attacked by sea serpents.
the group has been called "the prototypical icon of human agony" in western art, and unlike the agony often depicted in christian art showing the passion of jesus and martyrs, this suffering has no redemptive power or reward.
the suffering is shown through the contorted expressions of the faces (charles darwin pointed out that laocoön's bulging eyebrows are physiologically impossible), which are matched by the struggling bodies, especially that of laocoön himself, with every part of his body straining.
pliny attributes the work, then in the palace of emperor titus, to three greek sculptors from the island of rhodes: agesander, athenodoros and polydorus, but does not give a date or patron.
in style it is considered "one of the finest examples of the hellenistic baroque" and certainly in the greek tradition, but it is not known whether it is an original work or a copy of an earlier sculpture, probably in bronze, or made for a greek or roman commission.
the view that it is an original work of the 2nd century bc now has few if any supporters, although many still see it as a copy of such a work made in the early imperial period, probably of a bronze original.
others see it as probably an original work of the later period, continuing to use the pergamene style of some two centuries earlier.
in either case, it was probably commissioned for the home of a wealthy roman, possibly of the imperial family.
various dates have been suggested for the statue, ranging from about 200 bc to the 70s ad, though "a julio-claudian date [between 27 bc and 68 ad] ... is now preferred".
although mostly in excellent condition for an excavated sculpture, the group is missing several parts, and analysis suggests that it was remodelled in ancient times and has undergone a number of restorations since it was excavated.
it is on display in the museo pio-clementino, a part of the vatican museums.
the story of laocoön, a trojan priest, came from the greek epic cycle on the trojan wars, though it is not mentioned by homer.
it had been the subject of a tragedy, now lost, by sophocles and was mentioned by other greek writers, though the events around the attack by the serpents vary considerably.
the most famous account of these is now in virgil's aeneid (see the aeneid quotation at the entry laocoön), but this dates from between 29 and 19 bc, which is possibly later than the sculpture.
however, some scholars see the group as a depiction of the scene as described by virgil.
in virgil, laocoön was a priest of poseidon who was killed with both his sons after attempting to expose the ruse of the trojan horse by striking it with a spear.
in sophocles, on the other hand, he was a priest of apollo, who should have been celibate but had married.
the serpents killed only the two sons, leaving laocoön himself alive to suffer.
in other versions he was killed for having had sex with his wife in the temple of poseidon, or simply making a sacrifice in the temple with his wife present.
in this second group of versions, the snakes were sent by poseidon and in the first by poseidon and athena, or apollo, and the deaths were interpreted by the trojans as proof that the horse was a sacred object.
the two versions have rather different morals: laocoön was either punished for doing wrong, or for being right.
the snakes are depicted as both biting and constricting, and are probably intended as venomous, as in virgil.
pietro aretino thought so, praising the group in 1537:
...the two serpents, in attacking the three figures, produce the most striking semblances of fear, suffering and death.
the youth embraced in the coils is fearful; the old man struck by the fangs is in torment; the child who has received the poison, dies.
in at least one greek telling of the story the older son is able to escape, and the composition seems to allow for that possibility.
the style of the work is agreed to be that of the hellenistic "pergamene baroque" which arose in greek asia minor around 200 bc, and whose best known undoubtedly original work is the pergamon altar (dated ca 180-160 bc, now in berlin).
here the figure of alcyoneus is shown in a pose and situation (including serpents) which is very similar to those of laocoön, though the style is "looser and wilder in its principles" than the altar.
the execution of the laocoön is extremely fine throughout, and the composition very carefully calculated, even though it appears that the group underwent adjustments in ancient times.
the two sons are rather small in scale compared to their father, but this adds to the impact of the central figure.
the fine white marble used is often thought to be greek, but has not been identified by analysis.
in pliny's survey of greek and roman stone sculpture in his encyclopedic natural history (xxxvi, 37), he says:
....in the case of several works of very great excellence, the number of artists that have been engaged upon them has proved a considerable obstacle to the fame of each, no individual being able to engross the whole of the credit, and it being impossible to award it in due proportion to the names of the several artists combined.
such is the case with the laocoön, for example, in the palace of the emperor titus, a work that may be looked upon as preferable to any other production of the art of painting or of [bronze] statuary.
it is sculptured from a single block, both the main figure as well as the children, and the serpents with their marvellous folds.
this group was made in concert by three most eminent artists, agesander, polydorus, and athenodorus, natives of rhodes.
it is generally accepted that this is the same work as is now in the vatican.
it is now very often thought that the three rhodians were copyists, perhaps of a bronze sculpture from pergamon, created around 200 bc.
it is noteworthy that pliny does not address this issue explicitly, in a way that suggests "he regards it as an original".
pliny states that it was located in the palace of the emperor titus, and it is possible that it remained in the same place until 1506 (see "findspot" section below).
he also asserts that it was carved from a single piece of marble, though the vatican work comprises at least seven interlocking pieces.
the phrase translated above as "in concert" (de consilii sententia) is regarded by some as referring to their commission rather than the artists' method of working, giving in nigel spivey's translation: " [the artists] at the behest of council designed a group...", which spivey takes to mean that the commission was by titus, possibly even advised by pliny among other savants.
the same three artists' names, though in a different order (athenodoros, agesander, and polydorus), with the names of their fathers, are inscribed on one of the sculptures at tiberius's villa at sperlonga (though they may predate his ownership), but it seems likely that not all the three masters were the same individuals.
though broadly similar in style, many aspects of the execution of the two groups are drastically different, with the laocoon group of much higher quality and finish.
some scholars used to think that honorific inscriptions found at lindos in rhodes dated agesander and athenodoros, recorded as priests, to a period after 42 bc, making the years 42 to 20 bc the most likely date for the laocoön group's creation.
however the sperlonga inscription, which also gives the fathers of the artists, makes it clear that at least agesander is a different individual from the priest of the same name recorded at lindos, though very possibly related.
the names may have recurred across generations, a rhodian habit, within the context of a family workshop (which might well have included the adoption of promising young sculptors).
altogether eight "signatures" (or labels) of an athenodoros are found on sculptures or bases for them, five of these from italy.
some, including that from sperlonga, record his father as agesander.
the whole question remains the subject of academic debate.
the group was unearthed in february 1506 in the vineyard of felice de fredis; informed of the fact, pope julius ii, an enthusiastic classicist, sent for his court artists.
michelangelo was called to the site of the unearthing of the statue immediately after its discovery, along with the florentine architect giuliano da sangallo and his eleven-year-old son francesco da sangallo, later a sculptor, who wrote an account over sixty years later:
the first time i was in rome when i was very young, the pope was told about the discovery of some very beautiful statues in a vineyard near santa maria maggiore.
the pope ordered one of his officers to run and tell giuliano da sangallo to go and see them.
so he set off immediately.
since michelangelo buonarroti was always to be found at our house, my father having summoned him and having assigned him the commission of the pope’s tomb, my father wanted him to come along, too.
i joined up with my father and off we went.
i climbed down to where the statues were when immediately my father said, "that is the laocoön, which pliny mentions".
then they dug the hole wider so that they could pull the statue out.
as soon as it was visible everyone started to draw (or "started to have lunch"), all the while discoursing on ancient things, chatting as well about the ones in florence.
julius acquired the group on march 23, giving de fredis a job as a scribe as well as the customs revenues from one of the gates of rome.
by august the group was placed for public viewing in a niche in the wall of the brand new belvedere garden at the vatican, now part of the vatican museums, which regard this as the start of their history.
as yet it had no base, which was not added until 1511, and from various prints and drawings from the time the older son appears to have been completely detached from the rest of the group.
in july 1798 the statue was taken to france in the wake of the french conquest of italy, though the replacement parts were left in rome.
it was on display when the new musée central des arts, later the musée napoléon, opened at the louvre in november 1800.  a competition was announced for new parts to complete the composition, but there were no entries.
some plaster sections by françois girardon, over 150 years old, were used instead.
after napoleon's final defeat at the battle of waterloo in 1815 most (but certainly not all) the artworks plundered by the french were returned, and the laocoön reached rome in january 1816.
when the statue was discovered, laocoön's right arm was missing, along with part of the hand of one child and the right arm of the other, and various sections of snake.
the older son, on the right, was detached from the other two figures.
the age of the altar used as a seat by laocoön remains uncertain.
artists and connoisseurs debated how the missing parts should be interpreted.
michelangelo suggested that the missing right arms were originally bent back over the shoulder.
others, however, believed it was more appropriate to show the right arms extended outwards in a heroic gesture.
according to vasari, in about 1510 bramante, the pope's architect, held an informal contest among sculptors to make replacement right arms, which was judged by raphael, and won by jacopo sansovino.
the winner, in the outstretched position, was used in copies but not attached to the original group, which remained as it was until 1532, when giovanni antonio montorsoli, a pupil of michelangelo, added his even more straight version of laocoön's outstretched arm, which remained in place until modern times.
in 1725-27 agostino cornacchini added a section to the younger son's arm, and after 1816 antonio canova tidied up the group after their return from paris, without being convinced by the correctness of the additions but wishing to avoid a controversy.
in 1906 ludwig pollak, archaeologist, art dealer and director of the museo barracco, discovered a fragment of a marble arm in a builder's yard in rome, close to where the group was found.
noting a stylistic similarity to the laocoön group he presented it to the vatican museums: it remained in their storerooms for half a century.
in 1957 the museum decided that this arm—bent, as michelangelo had suggested—had originally belonged to this laocoön, and replaced it.
according to paolo liverani: "remarkably, despite the lack of a critical section, the join between the torso and the arm was guaranteed by a drill hole on one piece which aligned perfectly with a corresponding hole on the other."
in the 1980s the statue was dismantled and reassembled, again with the pollak arm incorporated.
the restored portions of the children's arms and hands were removed.
in the course of disassembly, it was possible to observe breaks, cuttings, metal tenons, and dowel holes which suggested that in antiquity, a more compact, three-dimensional pyramidal grouping of the three figures had been used or at least contemplated.
according to seymour howard, both the vatican group and the sperlonga sculptures "show a similar taste for open and flexible pictorial organization that called for pyrotechnic piercing and lent itself to changes at the site, and in new situations".
the more open, planographic composition along a plane, used in the restoration of the laocoön group, has been interpreted as "apparently the result of serial reworkings by roman imperial as well as renaissance and modern craftsmen".
a different reconstruction was proposed by seymour howard, to give "a more cohesive, baroque-looking and diagonally-set pyramidal composition", by turning the older son as much as 90°, with his back to the side of the altar, and looking towards the frontal viewer rather than at his father.
other suggestions have been made.
the discovery of the laocoön made a great impression on italian artists and continued to influence italian art into the baroque period.
michelangelo is known to have been particularly impressed by the massive scale of the work and its sensuous hellenistic aesthetic, particularly its depiction of the male figures.
the influence of the laocoön, as well as the belvedere torso, is evidenced in many of michelangelo's later sculptures, such as the rebellious slave and the dying slave, created for the tomb of pope julius ii.
several of the ignudi and the figure of haman in the sistine chapel ceiling draw on the figures.
raphael used the face of laocoön for his homer in his parnassus in the raphael rooms, expressing blindness rather than pain.
the florentine sculptor baccio bandinelli was commissioned to make a copy by the medici pope leo x. bandinelli's version, which was often copied and distributed in small bronzes, is in the uffizi gallery, florence, the pope having decided it was too good to send to françois i of france as originally intended.
a bronze casting, made for françois i at fontainebleau from a mold taken from the original under the supervision of primaticcio, is at the musée du louvre.
there are many copies of the statue, including a well-known one in the grand palace of the knights of st. john in rhodes.
many still show the arm in the outstretched position, but the copy in rhodes has been corrected.
the group was rapidly depicted in prints as well as small models, and became known all over europe.
titian appears to have had access to a good cast or reproduction from about 1520, and echoes of the figures begin to appear in his works, two of them in the averoldi altarpiece of 1520–22.
a woodcut, probably after a drawing by titian, parodied the sculpture by portraying three apes instead of humans.
it has often been interpreted as a satire on the clumsiness of bandinelli's copy, or as a commentary on debates of the time around the similarities between human and ape anatomy.
it has also been suggested that this woodcut was one of a number of renaissance images that were made to reflect contemporary doubts as to the authenticity of the laocoön group, the 'aping' of the statue referring to the incorrect pose of the trojan priest who was depicted in ancient art in the traditional sacrificial pose, with his leg raised to subdue the bull.
over 15 drawings of the group made by rubens in rome have survived, and the influence of the figures can be seen in many of his major works, including his descent from the cross in antwerp cathedral.
the original was seized and taken to paris by napoleon bonaparte after his conquest of italy in 1799, and installed in a place of honour in the musée napoléon at the louvre.
following the fall of napoleon, it was returned by the allies to the vatican in 1816.
pliny's description of laocoön as "a work to be preferred to all that the arts of painting and sculpture have produced" has led to a tradition which debates this claim that the sculpture is the greatest of all artworks.
johann joachim winkelmann (1717-1768) wrote about the paradox of admiring beauty while seeing a scene of death and failure.
the most influential contribution to the debate, gotthold ephraim lessing's essay laocoon: an essay on the limits of painting and poetry, examines the differences between visual and literary art by comparing the sculpture with virgil's verse.
he argues that the artists could not realistically depict the physical suffering of the victims, as this would be too painful.
instead, they had to express suffering while retaining beauty.
the most unusual intervention in the debate, william blake's annotated print laocoön, surrounds the image with graffiti-like commentary in several languages, written in multiple directions.
blake presents the sculpture as a mediocre copy of a lost israelite original, describing it as "jehovah & his two sons satan & adam as they were copied from the cherubim of solomons temple by three rhodians & applied to natural fact or history of ilium".
this reflects blake's theory that the imitation of ancient greek and roman art was destructive to the creative imagination, and that classical sculpture represented a banal naturalism in contrast to judeo-christian spiritual art.
the central figure of laocoön served as loose inspiration for the indian in horatio greenough's the rescue (1837–1850) which stood before the east facade of the united states capitol for over 100 years.
near the end of charles dickens' a christmas carol, ebenezer scrooge self-describes "making a perfect laocoön of himself with his stockings" in his hurry to dress on christmas morning.
john ruskin disliked the sculpture and compared its "disgusting convulsions" unfavourably with work by michelangelo, whose fresco of the brazen serpent, on a corner pendentive of the sistine chapel, also involves figures struggling with snakes - the fiery serpents of the book of exodus.
he invited contrast between the "meagre lines and contemptible tortures of the laocoon" and the "awfulness and quietness" of michelangelo, saying "the slaughter of the dardan priest" was "entirely wanting" in sublimity.
furthermore, he attacked the composition on naturalistic grounds, contrasting the carefully studied human anatomy of the restored figures with the unconvincing portrayal of the snakes:
for whatever knowledge of the human frame there may be in the laocoön, there is certainly none of the habits of serpents.
the fixing of the snake's head in the side of the principal figure is as false to nature, as it is poor in composition of line.
a large serpent never wants to bite, it wants to hold, it seizes therefore always where it can hold best, by the extremities, or throat, it seizes once and forever, and that before it coils, following up the seizure with the twist of its body round the victim, as invisibly swift as the twist of a whip lash round any hard object it may strike, and then it holds fast, never moving the jaws or the body, if its prey has any power of struggling left, it throws round another coil, without quitting the hold with the jaws; if laocoön had had to do with real serpents, instead of pieces of tape with heads to them, he would have been held still, and not allowed to throw his arms or legs about.
in 1910 the critic irving babbit used the title the new laokoon: an essay on the confusion of the arts for an essay on contemporary culture at the beginning of the 20th century.
in 1940 clement greenberg adapted the concept for his own essay entitled towards a newer laocoön in which he argued that abstract art now provided an ideal for artists to measure their work against.
a 2007 exhibition at the henry moore institute in turn copied this title while exhibiting work by modern artists influenced by the sculpture.
the location where the buried statue was found in 1506 was always known to be "in the vineyard of felice de fredis" on the oppian hill (the southern spur of the esquiline hill), as noted in the document recording the sale of the group to the pope.
but over time, knowledge of the site's precise location was lost, beyond "vague" statements such as sangallo's "near santa maria maggiore" (see above) or it being "near the site of the domus aurea" (the palace of the emperor nero); in modern terms near the colosseum.
an inscribed plaque of 1529 in the church of santa maria in aracoeli records the burial of de fredis and his son there, covering his finding of the group but giving no occupation.
research published in 2010 has recovered two documents in the municipal archives (badly indexed, and so missed by earlier researchers), which have established a much more precise location for the find: slightly to the east of the southern end of the sette sale, the ruined cistern for the successive imperial baths at the base of the hill by the colosseum.
the first document records de fredis' purchase of a vineyard of about 1.5 hectares from a convent for 135 ducats on 14 november 1504, exactly 14 months before the finding of the statue.
the second document, from 1527, makes it clear that there is now a house on the property, and clarifies the location; by then de fredis was dead and his widow rented out the house.
the house appears on a map of 1748, and still survives as a substantial building of three storeys, as of 2014[update] in the courtyard of a convent.
the area remained mainly agricultural until the 19th century, but is now entirely built up.
it is speculated that de fredis began building the house soon after his purchase, and as the group was reported to have been found some four metres below ground, at a depth unlikely to be reached by normal vineyard-digging operations, it seems likely that it was discovered when digging the foundations for the house, or possibly a well for it.
the findspot was inside and very close to the servian wall, which was still maintained in the 1st century ad (possibly converted to an aqueduct), though no longer the city boundary, as building had spread well beyond it.
the spot was within the gardens of maecenas, founded by gaius maecenas the ally of augustus and patron of the arts.
he bequeathed the gardens to augustus in 8 bc, and tiberius lived there after he returned to rome as heir to augustus in 2 ad.
pliny said the laocoön was in his time at the palace of titus (qui est in titi imperatoris domo), then heir to his father vespasian, but the location of titus's residence remains unknown; the imperial estate of the gardens of maecenas may be a plausible candidate.
if the laocoön group was already in the location of the later findspot by the time pliny saw it, it might have arrived there under maecenas or any of the emperors.
the extent of the grounds of nero's domus aurea is now unclear, but they do not appear to have extended so far north or east, though the newly rediscovered findspot-location is not very far beyond them.

the monumento a giuseppe garibaldi is an equestrian sculpture featuring giuseppe garibaldi, located on plaza italia, a landmark in the palermo neighbourhood of buenos aires, argentina.
giuseppe garibaldi (1807–1882) was an italian military and political figure.
in his twenties, he joined the carbonari italian patriot revolutionaries, and had to flee italy after a failed insurrection.
he then led the italian legion in the uruguayan civil war, and afterwards returned to italy as a commander in the conflicts of the risorgimento.
he has been dubbed the "hero of the two worlds" in tribute to his military expeditions in both south america and europe.
donated to the city by italian residents, it was built by italian sculptor eugenio maccagnani as a replica of the one located in brescia, italy, and was inaugurated on june 19, 1904.

vaga is an artists’ rights organization and copyright collective, representing over 6,000 visual artists worldwide.
founded in 1976, it was the first fine art and photography royalty collecting society in the united states, and continues to be one of the largest.
modeled after ascap (the american society of composers, authors and publishers), vaga acts as a clearinghouse for licensing reproduction rights to publishers, museums, film production companies, auction houses, galleries, multinational corporations, and other users of art.
in addition, vaga protects its members from infringements, advises on all aspects of intellectual property law, and advocates for artists’ rights.
vaga represents artists worldwide, both directly and through agreements with affiliated organizations in other countries.
as a member of cisac, the international confederation of societies that represent creators, vaga takes part in establishing the international standards that govern the use of copyrighted works.
vaga works to improve artists’ rights through consultation with the u.s. copyright office and by lobbying congress for improved rights legislation.
vaga, along with other rights organizations, in 2014 initiated the introduction of the american royalties too (art) act.
the bill was introduced in the house of representatives by rep. jerrold nadler and in the senate by senators tammy baldwin and ed markey.
if enacted, the bill will establish a resale royalty, whereby the creator of a work would receive a percentage of the sale of that work when it is resold at auction.
in 2012, the u.s. copyright office reviewed the viability of a resale royalty law in the u.s. vaga submitted public comments in support of such a law, and addressed the concerns of critics.
vaga's executive director, robert panzer, also participated in roundtable discussions hosted by the u.s. copyright office in order to advocate for a resale royalty law.
the findings of the office’s review were determinedly in favor of a resale royalty law in the us.

josé bonifácio de andrada e silva (portuguese pronunciation: [ʒuˈzɛ buniˈfasju dʒi ɐ̃ˈdɾadɐ i ˈsiwvɐ], 13 june 1763 – 6 april 1838) was a brazilian statesman, naturalist, professor and poet, born in santos, são paulo, then part of the portuguese empire.
he was one of the most important mentors of brazilian independence, and his actions were decisive for the success of emperor pedro i. he supported public education, was an abolitionist and suggested that a new national capital be created in brazil's underdeveloped interior (effected over a century later as brasília).
his career as naturalist was marked by the discovery of four new minerals.
in 1800, andrada e silva was appointed professor of geology at coimbra, and soon after inspector-general of the portuguese mines; and in 1812 he was made perpetual secretary of the lisbon academy of sciences.
returning to the colony in 1819, he urged dom pedro i to resist the recall of the lisbon court, and was appointed one of his ministers in 1821. when the independence of brazil was declared, andrada e silva was made minister of the interior and of foreign affairs; and when it was established, he was again elected by the constituent assembly.
he was also the author of the abolition project in brazil, presented to the constituent assembly in 1823.  but his democratic principles resulted in his dismissal from office in july 1823.
josé bonifácio spent part of his life in europe.
in his trips around europe he studied chemistry and mineralogy with other scientists.
he collected data, made scientific experiences and discovered 4 new minerals and 8 types of unknown species.
the mineral andradite is named after him.
among his other discoveries was petalite, a lithium-containing material, first discovered by andrade toward the end of the 18th century on a trip to sweden, and it was in this mineral swedish chemists first discovered lithium.
he also was the first to discover another important lithium-containing mineral spodumene from the same source, the island of utö in the stockholm archipelago of sweden.
in 1797 he was elected a foreign member of the royal swedish academy of sciences.
graduated in law and natural philosophy in coimbra, he joined the academia das ciências de lisboa (science academy of lisbon).
he taught geognosy at the university of coimbra in portugal.
knowing twelve languages, he could speak four.
in 1819, he travelled back to brazil where he continued to conduct scientific research.
a talented man having an unquiet temperament, he was also appointed minister for kingdom and overseas affairs and became the de facto prime minister.
his relationship with the prince became incompatible and he decided to join the opposition.
in 1823 he was exiled and went to live in bordeaux where, in 1825, come out his "poesias avulsas" (sundry poetries).
to publish them he used the pseudonym américo elísio.
on the dissolution of the assembly in november (the night of agony), he was arrested and banished to france, where he lived in exile near bordeaux until 1829, when he was permitted to return to brazil.
in 1831 when dom pedro i abdicated from the throne, he was appointed by the former emperor to be the tutor of the emperor's son.
since he did not agree with the regent's government he tried to reestablish the empire.
after being again arrested in 1833 and tried for intriguing on behalf of dom pedro i, he passed the rest of his days in retirement at the city of niterói.
he lost his duties of tutor and was accused of being a traitor, but he was eventually pardoned.
in december 1836, he contracted tuberculosis.
he died of the disease on 6 april 1838 in niterói.
josé bonifácio had also been engaged in literature.
his work poesias avulsas that come out in bordeaux were republished in brazil, in 1861, by the publisher laemmert.
in brazil it received the title "poesias" (poetries) and the publication had the coordination of joaquim norberto de sousa.
in 1942 afrânio peixoto prepared another issue through the brazilian academy of letters.
this work, prefaced with a text by sérgio buarque de holanda, was also published in a collection, as volume i, idealized by the "instituto nacional do livro" (the national book institute), appearing in 1946 with the title poesias de américo elísio [américo elísio's poetry].
his poetry shows a naturalistic pantheism that expresses his intellectual character and scientific curiosity.
his scientific, political and social works are published in volume iii, compiled and reproduced by edgar cerqueira falcão with the title obras científicas, politicas e sociais de josé bonifácio de andrada e silva.
its third edition came out in 1963 to celebrate the bicentennial of the patriarch of the independence.
saint josé de anchieta y díaz de clavijo, s.j.
(joseph of anchieta) (19 march 1534 – 9 june 1597) was a spanish jesuit missionary to the portuguese colony of brazil in the second half of the 16th century.
a highly influential figure in brazil's history in the first century after its european discovery, anchieta was one of the founders of são paulo in 1554 and of rio de janeiro in 1565. he is the first playwright, the first grammarian and the first poet born in the canary islands, and the father of brazilian literature.
anchieta was also involved in the religious instruction and conversion to the catholic faith of the indian population.
his efforts along with those of another jesuit missionary, manuel da nóbrega, at indian pacification were crucial to the establishment of stable colonial settlements in the colony.
with his book arte de gramática da língua mais usada na costa do brasil, anchieta became the first person to provide an orthography to the old tupi language most commonly spoken by the indigenous people of brazil.
anchieta is commonly known as "the apostle of brazil".
he was canonized by pope francis on 3 april 2014. he was the second native of the canary islands, after peter of saint joseph betancur, also a missionary to latin america, declared a saint by the catholic church.
anchieta is also considered the third saint of brazil.
anchieta was born on 19 march 1534, in san cristóbal de la laguna on tenerife in the canary islands, spain, to a wealthy family.
he was baptized on 7 april 1534 in the parish of our lady of remedies (now la laguna cathedral).
his father, juan  anchieta y zelaiaran, was a landowner from urrestilla, in the basque country, who had escaped to tenerife in 1525 after participating in an unsuccessful rebellion against the emperor charles v. through him, anchieta was related to ignatius of loyola, founder of the society of jesus.
his mother was mencia díaz de clavijo y llarena, a descendant of the conquerors of tenerife.
mencia was the daughter of sebastián de llarena, a jew who had converted to christianity, from the kingdom of castile.
when he was 14 years old, anchieta went to study in portugal at the royal college of arts in coimbra.
he was intensely religious and felt he had a vocation to the priesthood.
he sought admission to the jesuit college of the university of coimbra and was accepted into the jesuits on 1 may 1551, at the age of 17. while he was a novice, he nearly ruined his health by his excessive austerity, causing an injury to the spine that made him almost a hunchback.
he learned to write portuguese and latin as well as his mother tongue.
in 1553, the jesuits included anchieta among the third group of their members sent to the portuguese colony of brazil, believing that the climate would improve his health.
after a perilous journey and a shipwreck, anchieta and his small group arrived in são vicente, the first village that had been founded in brazil in 1534. there he made his first contact with the tapuia indians living in the region.
in late 1553, manuel da nóbrega, the first provincial of the jesuits in brazil, sent 13 jesuits including anchieta to climb the serra do mar to a plateau along the tietê river that the indians called piratininga (from tupi pira "fish" + tininga "drying" – according to anchieta, more than 12,000 fish could be found drying along the tietê river floodplains after one of its customary floods).
there the jesuits established a small missionary settlement and celebrated mass for the first time on 25 january 1554, date of the conversion of saint paul, according to tradition.
that date is now celebrated as the founding of são paulo.
anchieta and his jesuit colleagues began their efforts to instruct the native people in the rudiments of christianity and convert them, while also introducing basic education in other subjects.
he taught latin to the indians, began to learn their language, old tupi, and started compiling a dictionary and a grammar.
their mission settlement, the jesuit college of são paulo of piratininga, soon developed into a small population center.
anchieta and nóbrega had long opposed the way the portuguese colonists were treating the indians and had a serious conflict about it with duarte da costa, who served as governor-general of brazil from 1553 to 1558. they nevertheless supported the portuguese against their french rivals in establishing claims to brazil and welcomed the support of portuguese authorities against the huguenot protestants whom the french at times welcomed to their settlements.
in fact, the two jesuits saw the french colony as a generally protestant enterprise, ignoring its catholic components and making no distinction between lutherans and calvinists.
anchieta recognized that violence could be necessary to create the conditions for evangelizing the indigenous inhabitants and later praised the colony's third governor general, mem de sá (1500–1572), for what he accomplished in killing large numbers of amerindians.
due to the systematic killings and ransacking of their villages by the portuguese colonists and attempts at enslaving them, the indian tribes along the coast of the present-day states of são paulo, rio de janeiro and espírito santo rebelled and formed an alliance, the tamoyo confederation, which soon allied themselves to the french colonists who had settled in guanabara bay in 1555 under the command of vice-admiral nicolas durand de villegaignon.
the conflict was brutal and at once international and inter-religious.
in one instance the portuguese hung ten frenchmen in an attempt to intimidate their enemies into submission.
in another in 1557, a protestant named jacques le balleur was put to death and anchieta, in some interpretations, helped the executioner carry out the sentence, though the facts are much disputed.
the tamoyo confederation attacked são paulo several times between 1562 and 1564 without success.
anchieta and nóbrega initiated peace negotiations with the tamoyos in the village of iperoig in modern ubatuba on the northern coast of são paulo state.
anchieta's skill with the tupi language was crucial in these efforts.
after many incidents and the near massacre of anchieta and nóbrega by the indians, they finally succeeded in gaining the indians' confidence, and peace was established between the tamoyo and tupiniquim nations and the portuguese.
portuguese-french hostilities were renewed when estácio de sá, a nephew of the new governor-general of brazil, mem de sá, was ordered to expel the french colonists.
with the support and blessings of anchieta and nóbrega, he departed with an army from são vicente and founded the ramparts of rio de janeiro at the foot of pão de açúcar, in 1565. anchieta was with him and participated in a number of battles between the portuguese and the french, each side supported by their indian allies.
he acted as a surgeon and interpreter.
he was also responsible for reporting back to the governor-general's headquarters in salvador, bahia, and participated in the final victorious battle against the french in 1567.
after the peace settlement, a jesuit college was founded in rio under the direction of nóbrega.
anchieta was invited to remain and succeeded him upon his death in 1570. despite his frailty and ill health, and the rigors of slow travel by foot and ship of the time, over the next ten years anchieta traveled extensively between rio de janeiro, bahia, espírito santo and são paulo, consolidating the jesuit mission in brazil.
in 1577 the fourth superior general of the jesuits, everard mercurian, appointed anchieta provincial superior of the order's members in brazil.
as his health worsened, anchieta requested relief from his duties in 1591. he died in brazil on 9 june 1597, at reritiba, espírito santo, mourned by more than 3,000 indians.
in the tradition of jesuits, anchieta was a prolific rapporteur, communicating by letters to his superiors.
his reports establish him as an ethnographer, though he focused on amerindian behavior that did not follow european norms, such as their choice of marriage partners, cannibalism, and the role of sorcerers.
his detailed testimony with respect to cannibalism is often cited by anthropologists.
he explained, for example, that the amerindians "believe that true kinship comes from the side of the fathers, who are the agents, and ... that the mothers are nothing more than bags in which the children grow" and therefore treat the children of a captured female and a member of their tribe with respect but sometimes eat the children of a captured male and a female member of their own tribe.
he detailed the practice of polygamy and, because it had produced dense networks of interrelations, advocated easing the church's consanguinity rules to allow all but brothers and sisters to marry.
anchieta was pioneer in transcribing the old tupi language and authored the first published work on that language, a "pathbreaking" grammar, arte de gramática da língua mais usada na costa do brasil, written in 1555 and published in 1589. according to one assessment, "his grammar and dictionary still rank among the best ever produced of a brazilian language, nearly 500 years later.... anchieta was a dedicated linguist whose work can be considered the beginning of amazonian linguistics (indeed it would not be stretching matters too far to call his work the beginning of linguistics in the americas."
his written works in the indigenous language span theology, religious instruction, theater and poetry.
he was also a historian, author of a biography of mem de sá.
composed of hexameters, de gestis meni de saa is the first epic about the americas.
it presents de sá as "a christian ulysses determined to oust satan" who "presides ... over hordes of demonic amerindians, creatures devoted to dismembering bodies".
with the arrival of the jesuits, "the cross expels demons" and "shamans lose preternatural power as they move from the wilderness into the civilized missions".
that work of history was one of his two major poems.
the other was de beata virgine dei matre, a poem to the virgin mary.
tradition holds that anchieta composed it while in captivity at iperoig in 1563 by writing verses in the wet sand of the beach and memorizing each day's lines so that upon his release he could write its 4,900 verses on paper in their entirety.
his dramas, written in a combination of tupi, portuguese, spanish, and latin, were not meant for the stage but for performance by local amateurs in village squares and churchyards.
they were traditional in form, written in verse with five-line stanzas, a literary form known as the auto, a portuguese devotional drama, following the tradition the jesuits had developed of using the theater first in classrooms and then for popular instruction.
casts were all male, both native and european, and both groups were meant to learn from the dramas' instruction in christian morals.
they were written for special occasions like a saint's feast day or to mark the arrival of relics in the colony.
scholars have noted that they contain considerable "contextual information", that is references to local events such as village rivalries.
for example, amerindian cannibalism is juxtaposed with the roasting of st. lawrence.
few of his plays survive, but those that do have been praised, despite being crafted for a local audience with a didactic purpose, for their "remarkable feeling for spectacle, calling for the use of body paint, native costumes, song and dance, fights, torches, and processions".
a performance might even call for cannon fire from a nearby ship, though the plays were typically "short on action and long on explanations of doctrine" and characters fall clearly into positive and negative types.
anchieta's "auto da pregação universel" of 1567 and published in 1672 is the first dramatic text in brazilian letters.
as a keen naturalist, he described several new plants and animals among the novelties of brazil's wildlife and geography.
a climbing vine has been named for him: anchietea a. st.-hil.
violaceae.
his lucid and detailed reports are still important for understanding the beliefs, manners, and customs of the native peoples and european settlers of the sixteenth century.
he was also an excellent surgeon and physician.
his manuscripts were gathered from archives in portugal and brazil in the 1730s as part of the process for his beatification and deposited in rome.
his works have been published as cartas, informações, fragmentos históricos e sermões (letters, reports, historical fragments and sermons).
josé de anchieta is celebrated as the founder of brazilian letters and, with nóbrega, apostle of brazil.
he has given his name to two cities, anchieta, in the state of espírito santo (formerly called reritiba, the place where he died), and anchieta, in the state of santa catarina, as well as many other places, roads, institutions, hospitals, and schools.
in 1965, the spanish postal service issued a stamp with the image of anchieta, in a series called "los forjadores de américa".
ney latorraca starred in the brazilian biographical film, anchieta, josé do brasil, which was released in 1977.
when beatified by pope john paul ii in 1980, anchieta acquired the title "blessed josé de anchieta."
pope francis announced his canonization as a saint on 3 april 2014. the announcement was first communicated to three priests from the canary islands (hometown of anchieta) who attended the mass of the pope in his residence in santa marta, who communicated it to the bishop of tenerife, bernardo álvarez afonso.
he used a process known as equivalent canonization that dispenses with the standard judicial procedures and ceremonies in the case of someone long venerated.
anchieta was the first spaniard canonized by pope francis.
during and after his life, josé de anchieta was considered almost a supernatural being.
many legends formed around him, such as that he once preached to and calmed an attacking jaguar.
to this day, a popular devotion holds that praying to anchieta protects against animal attacks.
josé de anchieta is highly revered in the canary islands.
a bronze statue by brazilian artist bruno giorgi in the city of san cristóbal de la laguna depicts josé de anchieta departing for portugal.
it was a gift from the government of brazil to anchieta's hometown, where a wooden image of him is also venerated in the cathedral of la laguna and carried in procession through the streets every 9 june.
in the basilica of our lady of candelaria (patron saint of the canary islands), there is a painting of josé de anchieta founding the city of são paulo.
in 1997, a biographical comic book was published.
saint josé de anchieta is the patron and model of catechists.
he was also declared by pope benedict xvi as one of the thirteen intercessors of the world youth day 2013, held in rio de janeiro.
in april 2015 he was declared by the national conference of bishops of brazil a copatron of brazil, whose patron saint is our lady of aparecida.
the main shrines dedicated to saint josé de anchieta in brazil and the canary islands are those that are directly related to his life:

condor is the common name for two species of new world vultures, each in a monotypic genus.
the name derives from the quechua kuntur.
they are the largest flying land birds in the western hemisphere.
they are:
condors are part of the family cathartidae which contains the new world vultures, whereas the 15 species of old world vultures are in the family accipitridae, that also includes hawks, eagles, and kites.
the new world and old world vultures evolved from different ancestors.
however, they both are carrion-eaters and have distinctive bare heads.
[citation needed]
both condors are very large broad-winged soaring birds, the andean condor being 5 cm shorter (beak to tail) on average than the northern species, but larger in wingspan.
california condors are the largest flying land birds in north america.
the andean condor is second only to the wandering albatross (up to 3.5 m) in terms of wingspan among all living flying birds.
the adult plumage is uniformly black, with the exception of a frill of white feathers nearly surrounding the base of the neck which are meticulously kept clean by the bird.
as an adaptation for hygiene, the condor's head and neck have few feathers, which exposes the skin to the sterilizing effects of dehydration and solar ultraviolet light at high altitudes.
the head is much flattened above.
in the male it is crowned with a caruncle or comb, while the skin of the neck in the male lies in folds, forming a wattle.
the skin of the head and neck is capable of flushing noticeably in response to emotional state, which serves to communicate between individuals.
[citation needed]
the middle toe is greatly elongated, and the hinder one but slightly developed, while the talons of all the toes are comparatively straight and blunt.
the feet are thus more adapted to walking as in their relatives the storks[citation needed], and of little use as weapons or organs of prehension as in birds of prey and old world vultures.
the female, contrary to the usual rule among birds of prey, is smaller than the male.
although it is on average about five cm shorter from beak to tail than the california condor, the andean condor is larger in wingspan, ranging from 274 to 310 cm (8.99 to 10.17 ft) and heavier, reaching up to 11 to 15 kg (24 to 33 lb) for males and 7.5 to 11 kg (17 to 24 lb) for females.
overall length can range from 117 to 135 cm (46 to 53 in) measurements are usually taken from specimens reared in captivity.
california condors' wingspan measures up to 2.9 m (9.5 ft), and they can weigh up to 10.4 kg (23 lb).
the skin on the necks will vary in color, depending on the age of the birds.
adult birds' skin color can range from cream, pink, yellow, or even orange during breeding season.
fossils from the pleistocene era have been found in various parts of north america, including new york and florida, leading scientists to believe that california condors or their ancestors once lived on the west coast of north america as well as all the way to the eastern coast.
some scientists also believe that an ancient relative of the condor, argentavis magnificens from south america, may have been the largest flying bird ever with a wingspan of 7 metres (23 ft).
sexual maturity and breeding behavior do not appear in the condor until 5 or 6 years of age.
they may live for 50 years or more, and mate for life.
the world's oldest condor died at 100 in the jardin d'essai du hamma in algiers.
the young are covered with a grayish down until they are almost as large as their parents.
they are able to fly after six months, but continue to roost and hunt with their parents until age two, when they are displaced by a new clutch.
there is a well-developed social structure within large groups of condors, with competition to determine a 'pecking order' by body language, competitive play behavior, and a wide variety of vocalizations, even though the condor has no voice box.
on the wing the movements of the condor are graceful.
the lack of a large sternum to anchor correspondingly large flight muscles identifies it physiologically as a primary soarer.
the birds flap their wings on rising from the ground, but after attaining a moderate elevation they seem to sail on the air.
wild condors inhabit large territories, often traveling 250 km (160 mi) a day in search of carrion.
they prefer large carcasses such as deer or cattle which they spot by looking for other scavengers, which cannot rip through the tougher hides of these larger animals with the efficiency of the larger condor.
in the wild they are intermittent eaters, often going for a few days without eating, then gorging themselves on several kilograms (pounds) at once, sometimes to the point of being unable to lift off the ground.
[citation needed]
the moche people of ancient peru worshiped nature.
they placed emphasis on animals and often depicted condors in their art.
the andean condor lives for a long age, 50 years and it has been said that in the wild they can live to 60 years of age.

ciudad satélite, commonly known as satélite, is a greater mexico city upper middle class suburban area located in naucalpan, state of mexico.
officially, the name corresponds exclusively to the homonym neighborhood, ciudad satélite, founded circa 1957. with time, the area surrounding it, including upper-class neighborhoods like lomas verdes, echegaray, paseos del bosque or colonial satélite, alongside adjacent municipalities atizapán de zaragoza and tlalnepantla de baz, have become collectively known as "satélite", due to its prominence as both an economically and socially dynamic area.
initially conceived as "a city outside the city", in response to the increasing population of mexico city's upper classes, it was one of mexico's most prominent architectural ventures of the 20th century.
designed and built by mexican architects mario pani and josé luis cuevas on grounds of then president miguel alemán's family ranch, "los pirules", which was purchased from the fuentes-centurion family on the hacienda "los chabacanos," it quickly rose to prominence among city dwellers wishing to acquire property outside the city proper.
satélite was originally conceived as a commuter bedroom community; developers hoped to maintain a green belt between it and mexico city, but its rapid development (and rising property prices) made this untenable.
however, popular culture, market segmentation, availability of services, and comings and goings of life in this area have helped to define satélite as a cultural center.
ciudad satélite became the core of a new suburban phenomenon that eventually included not only single-family dwellings but also apartment buildings, condominiums,  and retail spaces; some manufacturing also developed.
this was a vast departure from the original concept.
over time, the progress of real estate development has expanded on the original meaning of the satélite community in the minds of mexico city residents.
the project was approved by then president miguel alemán valdés in 1948. the city remained uninhabited until 1952, when people started to move in because of the attractive prices.
public services such as the phone lines were not finished yet in all circuits and people initially had to use public phones.
by the 1970s, the ciudad satélite population vastly increased.
due to rapid growth, more neighborhoods were developed and are considered as part of the area of satélite.
these neighborhoods are las américas neighbourhood, next to naucalpan city hall, vista del valle (after the famous norwegian poet), paseos del bosque, pedregal de echegaray and el mirador.
some consider the neighbourhoods of san mateo, la florida and the echegaray borough to be part of the south zone of satélite.
the central-western zone consists of ciudad satélite, the core neighbourhood, lomas verdes, boulevares, naucalli park, and la concordia.
the northern zone consists of fuentes de satélite, santa cruz del monte, bellavista, and calacoaya neighbourhoods.
the only pre-hispanic facts known about the area are that once the tlatilca culture lived in the area formed between totolinga, los cuartos and hondo rivers.
(tucked inside the industrial zone of naucalpan is a small museum).
later, during the colonial period, the shrine of our lady of los remedios was built when a spanish officer found the religious figure under a maguey plant.
it is said that the small virgin had been brought by gonzalo rodríguez de villafuerte.
the shrine, which divides the satélite area from the popular zones of naucalpan municipality, was built in the sixteenth century, and in the architectural compound we can find the well-known caracoles or los remedios aqueduct.
ciudad satélite, the core neighborhood, started as a new urban concept in the mid fifties, when the rapid growth of mexico city and the rise of a new, energetic middle class forced the development of entire new neighborhoods.
it has been said that the grounds (in the northwestern suburbs of the city, near the old highway to querétaro) originally belonged to mexican president miguel alemán valdés, who was in office from 1946 to 1952.  he kept some acres and built a mansion in doctors circuit.
architect mario pani created most of the urban design.
the great novelty in ciudad satélite is the total absence (at least in the core neighborhood) of traffic lights, due to an ingenious street layout with "circuitos" or wide oval circuits where incorporation to other main roads allow drivers to see if cars are coming.
each of ciudad satélite circuits has several streets with names of famous professionals relating to the circuit's name.
the names of the circuits are the following: centro comercial (the mall), centro cívico (civic center), sculptors, painters, musicians, mineralogists, pedagogues, scientists, engineers, teachers, historians, surgeons, doctors, medics, geographers, sailors, playwrights, orators, missionaries, architects, poets, novelists, economists, heroes, jurists, journalists, diplomats, and the two external circuits (circunvalación oriente y circunvalación poniente).
the urban design and the original pricing for the grounds was deliberately intended for segmenting the new city into three areas: middle class, upper middle class and high class.
novelists and economists  were the circuits with the highest ground prices, so it is not a surprise that the most spectacular manors were built there.
many of ciudad satélite's houses were built in a functionalist style, absent of any kind of decorative elements in the facade.
this also applies to the so-called ciudad satélite's cathedral, san felipe de jesús sanctuary.
this big, spectacular church features many functionalist style elements, as well as astounding paintings.
other styles present in the neighborhood are colonial, modernist (vintage mexican architecture), and spanish or californian colonial style.
the next neighborhoods were then developed, and the urban extension of satélite area has been growing ever since.
contemporary issues in satélite include the big traffic problems (as this is a sleep-over zone, many people drive to mexico city everyday), the decrepit state of many roads, new concerns of car robberies, violations of environmental regulations, saturation and oversupply of real estate due to new developments, and unauthorised commerce in residential-designed zones.
many of the old history of the area is seen in our lady of los remedios shrine and its aqueduct.
torres de satélite (satellite towers).
this landmark stands in the middle of periferico, mexico city's main freeway.
designed by mathias goeritz and luis barragán and inspired in the painter jesus reyes ferreyra's ideas, it is a significant piece of modern sculpture and architecture.
due to the unusual fact that nobody really owns the land over which they were built, they were not maintained by any government and had fallen into disrepair.
in the latter 1990s they were finally repainted in their original colors, which had been chosen by barragán.
naucalli park is a large extension of eucalyptus forest devoted to the recreation of locals and other inhabitants of nearby areas.
it used to be an ejido (communal agricultural grounds) called "ejido de oro".
an expropriation decree converted it into a park which has a jogging circuit, many playground spots, monumental fountains, a convention center, an aaora (forum for art exhibits), a culture house, the branch of a well-known mexico city restaurant, an archery training ground, a big forum for classical music concerts (the state of mexico symphonic orchestra used to play here on sundays) and an amusement park with animatronic dinosaurs.
plaza satélite, built in the late sixties by the studio of architect juan sordo madaleno, is one of the biggest malls in mexico city.
it has undergone two full renewals and has all of the big department stores of the country, music stores, restaurants, boutiques, services and a big cinema complex.
mundo e is a smaller, more middle to lower middle class mall, with libraries, boutiques, cinema complex, fitness center and a couple of nightclubs.
other smaller malls are heliplaza, shopping plaza and the commerces on zona esmeralda.
a new and controversial big mall was built at la cúspide (the summit), which is the area's highest ground, offering sweeping views of mexico city.
the mall circuit zone (circuito centro comercial) is satélite's central commercial zone.
besides the big mall, it includes several commerces such as restaurants, nightclubs, cafeterias, three bookstores, and banks.
tuned cars this zone is widely recognized by its huge amount of modified cars, mostly middle to low end cars with powerful audio systems, neon lights at the bottom, and big rims.
the blue zone (la zona azul) is a nostalgic pair of commercial blocks that have some of the first businesses that operated in the area.
it is such a famous icon of satélite that it is the local place for joy demonstrations after the mexico national football team's victories.
a well-known ice cream and spicy fruit parlour is the main culinary attraction.
there are also  other food options, a branch of a world class cafeteria and an old stationery store.
the blue zone is known for drag racing of motorcycles and custom tuned cars.
the ruins of acropolis was originally built as an outdoor shopping mall.
it never obtained popularity and was abandoned.
nowadays it stands as one of the landmarks of ciudad satélite.
luis barragán's landscape sculptures can be seen in arboledas neighbourhood.
however, some are in a decrepit state.
parque de los ciervos (wild deer park) in zona esmeralda is a forest park where wild deer are raised.
it has picnic and playground facilities.
satélite is known for its excellent educational circuit: some good private schools as well as a couple of public junior highs have their home here.
school competition is officially low but is a big issue of pride for many "satelucos", to the extent of determining a particular state of mind for them.
the most important educational center is the unam faculty of superior studies at acatlán.
the area also houses a universidad del valle de mexico (uvm) university campus.
some of mexico's best known olympic medallists lived or live here, including carlos mercenario, soraya jiménez, dolores knoll, and fernando platas.
in the lower zone of boulevares, almost next to acatlán town, are the fields of the zone representative teams, such as the buccaneers (bucaneros), the cowboys (vaqueros), the black dogs (perros negros), and the redskins (pieles rojas).
there is also a local soccer football league, liga de fútbol satélite.
cultural exports from satélite include classical tenor rolando villazón, the members of the band café tacvba, troubadour fernando delgadillo, and rock band dildo.
for more prominent "satelucos", see this list: satelín-torres#prominent satelucos.
in the sixties, monseñor jose de jesus lopez created ardecusa (arte deporte y cultura de satélite, in spanish), a group of young people that enhanced the cultural and sports life in satelite through theatre, choirs, groups, sports teams, newspapers, and others.
the most famous were coro genesis (founded by gerardo bru and hilda and gustavo anaya) that was the only choir in the area that won 3 times the gycas (grupos y coros del area satélite).
also gerardo bru was the president of ardecusa for many years and the group presented most of the very memorable musicals like seven brides for seven brothers, the king and i, something´s afoot, godspel, grease, and anything ggoes.

pedro álvares cabral[a] (european portuguese: [ˈpeðɾu ˈaɫvɐr(ɨ)ʃ kɐˈβɾaɫ] or brazilian portuguese: [ˈpedɾu ˈawvaɾis kaˈbɾaw]; né pedro álvares de gouveia; c. 1467 or 1468 – c. 1520) was a portuguese nobleman, military commander, navigator and explorer regarded as the european discoverer of brazil.
in 1500 cabral conducted the first substantial exploration of the northeast coast of south america and claimed it for portugal.
while details of cabral's early life remain unclear, it is known that he came from a minor noble family and received a good education.
he was appointed to head an expedition to india in 1500, following vasco da gama's newly-opened route around africa.
the undertaking had the aim of returning with valuable spices and of establishing trade relations in india—bypassing the monopoly on the spice trade then in the hands of arab, turkish and italian merchants.
although the previous expedition of vasco da gama to india, on its sea route, had recorded signs of land west of the southern atlantic ocean (in 1497), cabral led the first known expedition to have touched four continents: europe, africa, america, and asia.
his fleet of 13 ships sailed far into the western atlantic ocean, perhaps intentionally, and made landfall (april 1500) on what he initially assumed to be a large island.
as the new land was within the portuguese sphere according to the 1494 treaty of tordesillas, cabral claimed it for the portuguese crown.
he explored the coast, realizing that the large land mass was probably a continent, and dispatched a ship to notify king manuel i of the new territory.
the continent was south america, and the land he had claimed for portugal later came to be known as brazil.
the fleet reprovisioned and then turned eastward to resume the journey to india.
a storm in the southern atlantic caused the loss of several ships, and the six remaining ships eventually rendezvoused in the mozambique channel before proceeding to calicut in india.
cabral was originally successful in negotiating trading rights, but arab merchants saw portugal's venture as a threat to their monopoly and stirred up an attack by both muslims and hindus on the portuguese entrepôt.
the portuguese sustained many casualties and their facilities were destroyed.
cabral took vengeance by looting and burning the arab fleet and then bombarded the city in retaliation for its ruler having failed to explain the unexpected attack.
from calicut the expedition sailed to the kingdom of cochin, another indian city-state, where cabral befriended its ruler and loaded his ships with coveted spices before returning to europe.
despite the loss of human lives and ships, cabral's voyage was deemed a success upon his return to portugal.
the extraordinary profits resulting from the sale of the spices bolstered the portuguese crown's finances and helped lay the foundation of a portuguese empire that would stretch from the americas to the far east.
[b]
cabral was later passed over, possibly as a result of a quarrel with manuel i, when a new fleet was assembled to establish a more robust presence in india.
having lost favor with the king, he retired to a private life of which few records survive.
his accomplishments slipped mostly into obscurity for more than 300 years.
decades after brazil's independence from portugal in the 19th century, cabral's reputation began to be rehabilitated by emperor pedro ii of brazil.
historians have long argued whether cabral was brazil's discoverer, and whether the discovery was accidental or intentional.
the first question has been settled by the observation that the few, cursory encounters by explorers before him were barely noticed at the time and contributed nothing to the future development and history of the land which would become brazil, the sole portuguese-speaking nation in the americas.
on the second question, no definite consensus has been formed, and the intentional discovery hypothesis lacks solid proof.
nevertheless, although he was overshadowed by contemporary explorers, historians consider cabral to be a major figure of the age of discovery.
little is certain regarding pedro álvares cabral's life before, or following, his voyage which led to the discovery of brazil.
he was born in 1467 or 1468—the former year being the most likely—at belmonte, about 30 kilometres (19 mi) from present-day covilhã in central portugal.
he was a son of fernão álvares cabral and isabel gouveia—one of five boys and six girls in the family.
cabral was christened pedro álvares de gouveia and only later, supposedly upon his elder brother's death in 1503, did he begin using his father's surname.
[c] the coat of arms of his family was drawn with two purple goats on a field of silver.
purple represented fidelity, and the goats were derived from the family name (cabral pertains to goats in english).
however, only his elder brother was entitled to make use of the family arms.
family lore said that the cabrais were descendants of caranus, the legendary first king of macedonia.
caranus was, in turn, a supposed 7th-generation scion of the demigod hercules.
[d] myths aside, the historian james mcclymont believes that another family tale might hold clues to the true origin of cabral's family.
according to that tradition, the cabrais derive from a castilian clan named the cabreiras  (cabra is spanish for goat) who bore a similar coat of arms.
[e] the cabral family rose to prominence during the 14th century.
álvaro gil cabral (cabral's great-great-grandfather and a frontier military commander) was one of the few portuguese nobles to remain loyal to dom joão i, king of portugal during the war against the king of castile.
as a reward, joão i presented álvaro gil with the hereditary fiefdom of belmonte.
raised as a member of the lower nobility, cabral was sent to the court of king dom afonso v in 1479 at around age 12. he received an education in the humanities and learned to bear arms and fight.
he would have been roughly age 17 on 30 june 1484 when he was named moço fidalgo (young nobleman; a minor title then commonly granted to young nobles) by king dom joão ii.
records of his deeds prior to 1500 are extremely fragmentary, but cabral may have campaigned in north africa, as had his ancestors and as was commonly done by other young nobles of his day.
king dom manuel i, who had acceded to the throne two years previously, awarded him an annual allowance worth 30,000 reais on 12 april 1497. he was concurrently given the title fidalgo (nobleman) in the king's council and was named a knight of the order of christ.
there is no contemporary image or detailed physical description of cabral.
it is known that he had a strong build and matched his father's height of 1.90 meters (6 ft 2.8 in).
cabral's character has been described as well-learned, courteous, prudent, generous, tolerant with enemies, humble, but also vain and too concerned with the respect he felt his honor and position demanded.
on 15 february 1500, cabral was appointed capitão-mor (literally major-captain, or commander-in-chief) of a fleet sailing for india.
it was then the custom for the portuguese crown to appoint nobles to naval and military commands, regardless of experience or professional competence.
this was the case for the captains of the ships under cabral's command—most were nobles like himself.
the practice had obvious pitfalls, since authority could as easily be given to highly incompetent and unfit people as it could fall to talented leaders such as afonso de albuquerque or dom joão de castro.
scant details have survived regarding the criteria used by the portuguese government in its selection of cabral as head of the india expedition.
in the royal decree naming him commander-in-chief, the only reasons given are "merits and services".
nothing more is known about these qualifications.
historian william greenlee argued that king manuel i "had undoubtedly known him well at court".
that, along with the "standing of the cabral family, their unquestioned loyalty to the crown, the personal appearance of cabral, and the ability which he had shown at court and in the council were important factors".
also in his favor may have been the influence of two of his brothers who sat on the king's council.
given the political intrigue present at court, cabral may have been part of a faction that furthered his appointment.
the historian malyn newitt subscribes to some sort of ulterior maneuvering and has said that the choice of cabral "was a deliberate attempt to balance the interests of rival factions of noble families, for he appears to have no other quality to recommend him and no known experience in commanding major expeditions."
cabral became the military chief, while far more experienced navigators were seconded to the expedition to aid him in naval matters.
the most important of these were bartolomeu dias, diogo dias and nicolau coelho.
they would, along with the other captains, command 13 ships and 1,500 men.
of this contingent, 700 were soldiers, although most were simple commoners who had no training or previous experience in combat.
the fleet had two divisions.
the first division was composed of nine naus (carracks) and two round caravels, and was headed to calicut (today more often known as kozhikode) in india with the goal of establishing trade relations and a factory (trading post).
the second division, consisting of one nau and one round caravel, set sail for the port of sofala in what is today mozambique.
in exchange for leading the fleet, cabral was entitled to 10,000 cruzados (an old portuguese currency equivalent to approximately 35 kg of gold) and the right to purchase 30 tonnes (33 short tons; 30 long tons) of pepper at his own expense for transport back to europe.
the pepper could then be resold, tax-free, to the portuguese crown.
he was also allowed to import 10 boxes of any other kind of spice, duty-free.
although the voyage was extremely hazardous, cabral had the prospect of becoming a very rich man if he returned safely to portugal with the cargo.
spices were then rare in europe and keenly sought-after.
an earlier fleet had been the first to reach india by circumnavigating africa.
that expedition had been led by vasco da gama and returned to portugal in 1499. for decades portugal had been searching for an alternate route to the east, in order to bypass the mediterranean sea which was under the control of the italian maritime republics and the ottoman empire.
portugal's expansionism would lead first to a route to india, and later to worldwide colonization.
a desire to spread catholic christianity to pagan lands was another factor motivating exploration.
there also was a long tradition of pushing back muslims, which stemmed from portugal's fight for nationhood against the moors.
the fight expanded first to north africa and eventually to the indian subcontinent.
an additional ambition which galvanized the explorers was the search for the mythical prester john—a powerful christian king with whom an alliance against islam could be forged.
finally, the portuguese crown sought a share in the lucrative west african trade in slaves and gold, and india's spice trade.
the fleet under the command of the 32–33-year-old cabral departed from lisbon on 9 march 1500 at noon.
the previous day it had been given a public send-off which included a mass and celebrations attended by the king, his court and a huge crowd.
on the morning of 14 march, the flotilla passed gran canaria, in the canary islands.
it sailed onward to cape verde, a portuguese colony situated on the west african coast, which was reached on 22 march.
the next day, a nau commanded by vasco de ataíde with 150 men disappeared without a trace.
the fleet crossed the equator on 9 april, and sailed westward as far as possible from the african continent in what was known as the volta do mar (literally "turn of the sea") navigational technique.
seaweed was sighted on 21 april, which led the sailors to believe that they were nearing the coast.
they were proven correct the next afternoon, wednesday 22 april 1500, when the fleet anchored near what cabral christened the monte pascoal ("easter mount", it being the week of easter).
the spot is on the northeast coast of present-day brazil.
the portuguese detected inhabitants on the shore, and all ships' captains gathered aboard cabral's lead ship on 23 april.
cabral ordered nicolau coelho, a captain who had experience from vasco da gama's voyage to india, to go ashore and make contact.
he set foot on land and exchanged gifts with the indigenous people.
after coelho returned, cabral took the fleet north, where after traveling 65 kilometres (40 mi) along the coast, it anchored on 24 april in what the commander-in-chief named porto seguro (safe port).
the place was a natural harbor, and afonso lopes (pilot of the lead ship) brought two natives aboard to confer with cabral.
as in the first contact, the meeting was friendly and cabral presented the locals with gifts.
the inhabitants were stone age hunter-gatherers, to whom the europeans assigned the generic label "indians".
the men collected food by stalking game, fishing and foraging, while the women engaged in small-scale farming.
they were divided into countless rival tribes.
the tribe which cabral met was the tupiniquim.
some of these groups were nomadic and others sedentary—having a knowledge of fire but not metalworking.
a few tribes engaged in cannibalism.
on 26 april, as more and more curious and friendly natives appeared, cabral ordered his men to build an altar inland where a christian mass was held—the first celebrated on the soil of what would later become brazil.
he, along with the ships' crews, participated.
the following days were spent stockpiling water, food, wood, and other provisions.
the portuguese also built a massive—perhaps 7 metres (23 ft) long—wooden cross.
cabral ascertained that the new land lay east of the demarcation line between portugal and spain that had been specified in the treaty of tordesillas.
the territory was thus within the sphere allotted to portugal.
to solemnize portugal's claim to the land, the wooden cross was erected and a second religious service held on 1 may.
in honor of the cross, cabral named the newly discovered land ilha de vera cruz (island of the true cross).
the next day a supply ship under the command of either gaspar de lemos or andré gonçalves (the sources conflict on who was sent) returned to portugal to apprise the king of the discovery.
the fleet resumed its voyage on either 2 or 3 may 1500 and sailed along the east coast of south america.
cabral became convinced that he had found an entire continent, rather than an island.
around 5 may, the fleet veered eastwards towards africa.
on 23 or 24 may they encountered a storm in the south atlantic's high-pressure zone, resulting in the loss of four ships.
the exact location of the disaster is unknown—speculations range from near the cape of good hope at the southern tip of the african continent to "within sight of the south american coast".
three naus and a caravel commanded by bartolomeu dias—the first european to reach the cape of good hope in 1488—foundered, and 380 men were lost.
the remaining vessels, hindered by rough weather and damaged rigging, were separated.
one ship that had been separated, commanded by diogo dias, wandered onward alone, and the other six ships were able to regroup.
they gathered into two formations consisting of three ships each, and cabral's group sailed east, past the cape of good hope.
fixing their position and sighting land, they turned north and landed somewhere in the primeiras and segundas archipelago, off east africa and north of sofala.
the main fleet remained near sofala ten days undergoing repairs.
the expedition then went north, and on 26 may reached kilwa kisiwani, where cabral made an unsuccessful attempt to negotiate a treaty with its king.
from kilwa kisiwani, the fleet departed to malindi, which was reached on 2 august.
cabral met with its king, with whom he established friendly relations and exchanged gifts.
pilots were recruited at malindi for the last leg to india and the fleet set sail.
land was reached at anjadip, an island frequented by ships to obtain supplies on their way to calicut.
here the ships were beached, recaulked and painted.
final arrangements were put into place for the encounter with the ruler of calicut.
the fleet departed anjadip and arrived in calicut on 13 september.
cabral successfully negotiated with the zamorin (the title of the ruler of calicut) and obtained permission to establish a factory and a warehouse.
in hopes of further improving relations, cabral dispatched his men on several military missions at the zamorin's request.
[f] however, on 16 or 17 december, the factory suffered a surprise attack by some 300 (according to other accounts, perhaps as many as several thousand) muslim arabs and hindu indians.
despite a desperate defense by crossbowmen, more than 50 portuguese were killed.
[g] the remaining defenders retreated to the ships, some by swimming.
thinking that the attack was the result of unauthorized incitement by jealous arab merchants, cabral waited 24 hours for an explanation from the ruler of calicut, but no apology was forthcoming.
the portuguese were outraged by the attack on the factory and the death of their comrades and seized 10 arab merchant ships at anchor in the harbor.
around 600 of their crews were killed and the cargoes confiscated before the merchantmen were set afire.
cabral also ordered his ships to bombard calicut for an entire day in reprisal for the violation of the agreement.
the massacre was blamed in part on portuguese animosity towards muslims, which had developed over centuries of conflict with the moors on the iberian peninsula and in north africa.
moreover, the portuguese were determined to dominate the spice trade and had no intention of allowing competition to flourish.
the arabs also had no desire to allow the portuguese to break their monopoly on access to spices.
the portuguese had started out by insisting on being given preferential treatment in every aspect of the trade.
the letter from king manuel i brought by cabral to the ruler of calicut, which was translated by the ruler's arab interpreters, sought the exclusion of arab traders.
the muslim merchants believed that they were about to lose both their trading opportunities and livelihoods, and attempted to sway the hindu ruler against the portuguese.
the portuguese and arabs were extremely suspicious of each other's every action.
historian william greenlee has argued that the portuguese realized that "they were few in numbers and that those who would come to india in the future fleets would always be at numerical disadvantage; so that this treachery must be punished in a manner so decisive that the portuguese would be feared and respected in the future.
it was their superior artillery which would enable them to accomplish this end."
thus, they created a precedent for european behavior in asia during the following centuries.
warnings in reports from vasco da gama's voyage to india had prompted king manuel i to brief cabral regarding another port to the south of calicut where he could also trade.
this city was kochi and the fleet set sail, reaching it on 24 december.
kochi was nominally a vassal of calicut, as well as being dominated by other indian cities.
kochi was eager to achieve independence, and the portuguese were willing to exploit indian disunity—as the british would three hundred years later.
this tactic eventually ensured portuguese hegemony over the region.
cabral forged an alliance with kochi's ruler, as well with rulers of other indian cities, and was able to establish a factory.
at last, loaded with precious spices, the fleet went to kannur for further trade before setting out on its return voyage to portugal on 16 january 1501.
the expedition headed for the east coast of africa.
one of the ships became stranded on a sandbar and the vessel began to founder.
as there was no space in the other ships, its cargo was lost and cabral ordered the carrack to be set on fire.
the fleet then proceeded to the island of mozambique (northeast of sofala), in order to take on provisions and make the ships ready for the rough passage around the cape of good hope.
one caravel was sent to sofala—another of the expedition's goals.
a second caravel, considered the fastest ship in the fleet and captained by nicolau coelho, was sent ahead to give the king advance notice of the voyage's success.
a third vessel, commanded by pedro de ataíde, became separated from the fleet after leaving mozambique.
on 22 may, the fleet—now reduced to only two ships—rounded the cape of good hope.
they arrived in beseguiche (now dakar, located near cape verde) on 2 june.
there they found not only nicolau coelho's caravel but also the nau captained by diogo dias—which had been lost for over a year following the disaster in the south atlantic.
the nau had experienced several adventures of its own[h] and was now in poor condition with only seven sick and malnourished men aboard—one of whom was so weak that he died of happiness upon again seeing his comrades.
another portuguese fleet was also found riding at anchor in beseguiche.
after manuel i had been told of the discovery of what is now brazil, he sent another and smaller fleet to explore it.
one of its navigators was amerigo vespucci (for whom the americas would be named), who told cabral of his exploration, confirming that he had indeed made landfall on an entire continent and not merely an island.
nicolau coelho's caravel departed first from beseguiche and arrived in portugal on 23 june 1501. cabral stayed behind, waiting for pedro de ataíde's missing ship and for the caravel that had been sent to sofala.
both eventually appeared and cabral arrived in portugal on 21 july 1501, with the other vessels coming home during the following days.
in all, two ships returned empty, five were fully loaded and six were lost.
nonetheless, the cargoes carried by the fleet returned up to 800% profit to the portuguese crown.
once sold, the proceeds covered the outlay in equipping the fleet, covered the cost of the vessels which had been lost, and cleared a profit which itself exceeded the total sum of those costs.
"undeterred by the unprecedented losses which he had sustained", asserts historian james mcclymont, when cabral "reached the east african coast, pressed forward to the accomplishment of the task which had been assigned to him and was able to inspire the surviving officers and men with like courage."
"few voyages to brazil and india were so well executed as cabral's", affirmed historian bailey diffie, which laid down a path leading to the immediate commencement "of a portuguese seagoing empire from africa to the far east", and eventually to "a land empire in brazil".
upon cabral's return, king manuel i began planning another fleet to make the journey to india and to avenge the portuguese losses in calicut.
cabral was selected to command this "revenge fleet", as it was called.
for eight months cabral made all preparations, but for reasons which remain uncertain, he was relieved of command.
it had apparently been proposed to give another navigator, vicente sodré, independent command over a section of the fleet, and cabral strongly opposed this.
whether he was dismissed or requested himself that he be relieved of command, the result was that when the fleet departed in march 1502, its commander was vasco da gama—a maternal nephew of vicente sodré—and not cabral.
it is known that hostility had developed between a faction supporting da gama and another supporting cabral.
at some point, cabral left the court permanently.
the king was greatly irritated by the feud, to such an extent that mentioning the matter in his presence could result in banishment, as it did for one of da gama's supporters.
despite the loss of favor with manuel i, cabral was able to contract an advantageous marriage in 1503 to dona (lady) isabel de castro, a wealthy noblewoman and descendant of king dom fernando i of portugal.
her mother was a sister of afonso de albuquerque, one of the greatest portuguese military leaders during the age of discovery.
the couple had at least four children: two boys (fernão álvares cabral and antónio cabral) and two girls (catarina de castro and guiomar de castro).
there were two additional daughters named isabel and leonor according to other sources, which also say that guiomar, isabel and leonor joined religious orders.
afonso de albuquerque attempted to intercede on cabral's behalf and on 2 december 1514 asked manuel i to forgive him and allow his return to court, but to no avail.
suffering from recurrent fever and a tremor (possibly malaria) since his voyage, cabral withdrew to santarém in 1509. he spent his remaining years there.
only sketchy information is available as to his activities during that time.
according to a royal letter dated 17 december 1509, cabral was party to a dispute over a transaction involving property which belonged to him.
another letter of that same year reported that he was to receive certain privileges for an undisclosed military service.
in 1518, or perhaps previously, he was raised from fidalgo to knight in the king's council and was entitled to a monthly allowance of 2,437 reais.
this was in addition to the annual allowance granted to him in 1497, and still being paid.
cabral died of unspecified causes, most probably in 1520. he was buried in the são joão evangelista chapel of the convento da graça in santarém.
the first permanent portuguese settlement in the land which would become brazil was são vicente, which was established in 1532 by martim afonso de sousa.
as the years passed, the portuguese would slowly expand their frontiers westward, conquering more lands from both indigenous americans and the spanish.
brazil had secured most of its present-day borders by 1750 and was regarded by portugal as the most important part of its far-flung maritime empire.
on 7 september 1822, the heir of portuguese king dom joão vi secured the independence of brazil from portugal and, as dom pedro i, became its first emperor.
cabral's discovery, and even his resting place in the land of his birth, had been almost completely forgotten during the span of nearly 300 years since his expedition.
this began to change beginning in the 1840s when emperor dom pedro ii, successor and son of pedro i, sponsored research and publications dealing with cabral's life and expedition through the brazilian historic and geographic institute.
this was part of the emperor's ambitious larger plan to foster and strengthen a sense of nationalism among brazil's diverse citizenry—giving them a common identity and history as residents of a unique portuguese-speaking empire, surrounded by hispanic-american republics.
the initial resurgence of interest in cabral had resulted from the rediscovery, in 1839, of his resting place by the brazilian historian francisco adolfo de varnhagen (later viscount of porto seguro).
the completely neglected state in which cabral's tomb was found nearly led to a diplomatic crisis between brazil and portugal—the latter then ruled by pedro ii's eldest sister, maria ii.
in 1871, the brazilian emperor—then on a trip to europe—visited cabral's gravesite and proposed an exhumation for scientific study, which was carried out in 1882. in a second exhumation during 1896, an urn containing earth and bone fragments was allowed to be removed.
although his remains still lay in portugal, the urn was eventually brought to the old cathedral of rio de janeiro in brazil on 30 december 1903. cabral has since become a national hero in brazil.
in portugal, however, he has been much overshadowed by his rival vasco da gama.
historian william greenlee argued that cabral's exploration is important "not only because of its position in the history of geography but because of its influence on the history and economics of the period."
though he acknowledges that few voyages have "been of greater importance to posterity", he also says that "few have been less appreciated in their time."
nevertheless, historian james mcclymont affirmed that "cabral's position in the history of portuguese conquest and discovery is inexpungable despite the supremacy of greater or more fortunate men."
he concluded that cabral "will always be remembered in history as the chief, if not the first discoverer of brazil."
a controversy that has occupied scholars for more than a century concerns whether cabral's discovery was by chance or intentional.
if the latter, that would mean that the portuguese had at least some hint that a land existed to the west.
the matter was first raised by emperor pedro ii in 1854 during a session of the brazilian historic and geographic institute, when he asked if the discovery might have been intentional.
until the 1854 conference, the widespread presumption was that the discovery had been an accident.
early works on the subject supported this view, including história do descobrimento e conquista da índia (history of the discovery and conquest of india, published in 1541) by fernão lopes de castanheda, décadas da ásia (decades of asia, 1552) by joão de barros, crônicas do felicíssimo rei d. manuel (chronicles of the most fortunate d. manuel, 1558) by damião de góis, lendas da índia (legends of india, 1561) by gaspar correia, história do brasil (history of brazil, 1627) by friar vicente do salvador and história da américa portuguesa (history of portuguese america, 1730) by sebastião da rocha pita.
the first work to advocate the idea of intentionality was published in 1854 by joaquim noberto de sousa e silva, after pedro ii had opened the debate.
since then, several scholars have subscribed to that view, including francisco adolfo de varnhagen, capistrano de abreu, pedro calmon, fábio ramos and mário barata.
historian hélio vianna affirmed that "although there are signs of the intentionality" in cabral's discovery, "based mainly in the knowledge or previous suspicion of the existence of lands at the edge of the south atlantic", there are no irrefutable proofs to support it.
this opinion is also shared by historian thomas skidmore.
the debate on whether it was a deliberate voyage of discovery or not is considered "irrelevant" by historian charles r. boxer.
historian anthony smith concludes that the conflicting contentions will "probably never be resolved".
cabral was not the first european to stumble upon areas of present-day brazil, not to mention other parts of south america.
roman coins have been found in today's venezuela, northwest of brazil, presumably from ships that were carried away by storm in ancient times.
norsemen reached north america and even established settlements, though these ended in failure sometime before the end of the 15th century.
christopher columbus, on his third voyage to the new world in 1498, traveled along part of what would later become venezuela.
in the case of brazil, it was once considered probable that the portuguese navigator duarte pacheco pereira had made a voyage to the brazilian coast in 1498. this belief has since been dismissed, however, and it is now thought that he voyaged to north america instead.
there is more certain evidence that two spaniards, vicente yáñez pinzón and diego de lepe, traveled along the northern coast of brazil between january and march 1500. pinzón went from what is today cabo de santo agostinho (brazilian state of pernambuco) to the mouth of the amazon river.
there he encountered another spanish expedition led by lepe, which would reach as far as the oyapock river in march.
the reason cabral is credited with having discovered brazil, rather than the spanish explorers, is because the visits by pinzón and lepe were cursory and had no lasting impact.
historians capistrano de abreu, francisco adolfo de varnhagen, mário barata and hélio vianna concur that the spanish expeditions did not influence the development of what would become the only portuguese-speaking nation in the americas—with a unique history, culture and society which sets it apart from the hispanic-american societies which dominate the rest of the continent.
fosca  was a british band, combining indie pop songwriting with synthpop instrumentation.
initially, the band was formed by bassist peter theobalds and orlando guitarist/lyricist dickon edwards plus orlando drummer david gray, before settling into being a vehicle for edwards and his songs.
over the next decade, edwards fronted several (predominantly female) lineups of the band including guitarist charley stone (formerly of gay dad).
they released a total of three studio albums between 2000-2008. the band was named after the protagonist in stephen sondheim's passion based upon the translation of lawrence venuti of the novel fosca by iginio ugo tarchetti, 1869.  they received press coverage from the independent.
the original version of fosca was founded in the summer of 1997 as a hard rock side project by dickon edwards, then concurrently the guitarist and lyricist for the romo band orlando, together with orlando's live drummer david gray and a bass player named peter theobalds.
edwards recruited laddish lead vocalist sav in what he would later describe as "an experiment of the laddish lion lying down with the limp-wristed lamb.".
this line-up performed five concerts between september 1997 and february 1998 - the first two predating dickon's final appearance with orlando, which he left to concentrate on fosca.
the final concert featured charley stone as guest guitarist.
they also recorded four tracks for a putative ep, one of which, the leopard of lime street would, later in 1998, feature on a volume of the sampler album series "snakebite city" on bluefire records.
in february 1998, dickon removed sav from the band as he felt the singer, "through not being an immediately apparent misfit, with consummate irony didn’t fit in fosca."
initially, david barnett, the future suede biographer auditioned to replace sav, however by april 1998 theobalds and gray had drifted away to a new band akercocke, while stone was otherwise committed to the band gay dad.
after several months of inactivity, a new version of fosca debuted on friday 25 september 1998 at queeruption in london.
from this point forward, dickon himself became the frontman for the band.
for the first show, the band included seven members, while the next, on new year's eve 1998, featured only three.
in early 1999, fosca made their first attempt at recording debut album on earth to make the numbers up at riverside studios in hammersmith, london.
this was eventually aborted after the budget ran out and one track, storytelling johnny was accidentally wiped by the dat recording machine.
however, one track from these sessions, file under forsaken, would later be released as the lead track for fosca's debut single nervous, london along with two additional tracks featuring rachel stevenson on folk-style lead vocals.
the remaining eight songs for the album were rerecorded in 2000 with a new synth-based sound not dissimilar to that of orlando, and released, still under the title on earth to make the numbers up, and preceded by the single the agony without the ecstasy on shinkansen recordings (an offshoot of sarah records who in early 1995 had released the reproduction is pollution ep by orlando under the alternative name shelley).
by this time, the band had stabilized into dickon edwards on vocals and guitar, rachel stevenson on keyboards and vocals, alex sharkey also on keyboards and vocals and sheila b on cello.
in 2001 the band released supine on the astroturf as the first single from their second album.
by the time follow-up single secret crush on third trombone and the parent album diary of an antibody were recorded and released in 2002, sharkey had been replaced by kate dornan, formerly the editor of orlando website orlando magic.
after a gap of some six years due to the collapse of shinkansen, fosca signed with the swedish independent record label but is it art?, on which they released a live album in 2007, followed by their third studio album the painted side of the rocket in sweden on 5 march 2008. uk release on 28 april.
the label also released a book of dickon's lyrics for fosca and orlando,the portable dickon edwards.
lyrics and other alibis 1993-2008.  by then, the current line-up was dickon edwards on vocals and guitar, rachel stevenson on keyboards and vocals, kate dornan on keyboards and vocals, tom edwards on guitar and former member charley stone returning to perform live on guitar.
a further single, the man i'm not today/my diogenes heart was released later in 2008. dickon disbanded fosca in march 2009  with the final concert being at klubb republik in norrköping, sweden on 14 march.
schiavo (pronounced [ˈskjaːvo]) is an italian surname and may refer to:
maria tudor is an opera in four acts composed by antônio carlos gomes to an italian-language libretto by emilio praga (completed by arrigo boito).
the libretto is based on victor hugo's 1833 play marie tudor, which centers on the rise, fall and execution of fabiano fabiani, a fictional favourite of mary i of england.
the opera premiered on 27 march 1879 at la scala, milan with anna d'angeri in the title role and francesco tamagno as fabiani.
the opera was a failure at its premiere and withdrawn, a heavy blow to gomes who was in serious financial and family difficulties at the time.
he returned to his native brazil the following year.
maria tudor was revived in november 1998 at the bulgarian national opera in sofia with eliane coelho in the title role.
the performance was televised and a live recording released on cd by the brazilian label imagemdata.
ruy barbosa de oliveira (5 november 1849 – 1 march 1923) was a brazilian polymath, diplomat, writer, jurist, and politician.
born in salvador, bahia, he was a federal representative, senator, minister of finance and diplomat.
for his distinguished participation in the 2nd hague conference, defending the principle of equality among nations, he earned the nickname "eagle of the hague".
he ran unsuccessfully for the presidency of brazil in 1910, 1914 and in 1919.
rui barbosa gave his first public speech for the abolition of slavery when he was 19.  for the rest of his life he remained an uncompromising defender of civil liberties.
slavery in brazil was finally abolished by the lei áurea ("golden law") in 1888. part of barbosa's legacy to history is that he authorised, as minister of finance on 14 december 1890, the destruction of most government records relating to slavery.
the avowed reason for this destruction, which took several years to be enacted and was followed by his successors, was to erase the "stain" of slavery on brazilian history.
however, historians today agree that barbosa aimed to prevent any possible indemnization of the former slave-owners for this liberation.
indeed, eleven days after the abolition of slavery, a law project was deposed at the chamber, proposing some indemnization to the slave owners.
barbosa's liberal ideas were influential in drafting of the first republican constitution.
he was a supporter of fiat money, as opposed to a gold standard, in brazil.
during his term as finance secretary, he implemented far-reaching reforms of brazil's financial regime, instituting a vigorously expansionist monetary policy.
the result was chaos and instability: the so-called fiat experiment resulted in the bubble of encilhamento, a dismal politic-economic failure.
due to his controversial role during it, in the following administration of floriano peixoto, he was forced into exile until floriano's term ended.
years later, after his return he was elected as a senator.
he headed the brazilian delegation to the 2nd hague conference and was brilliant in its deliberations.
as candidate of the civilian party in the presidential election of 1910, barbosa waged one of the most memorable campaigns in brazilian politics.
he was not successful and lost to marshal hermes da fonseca.
he ran again in the elections of 1914 and 1919, both times losing to the government candidate.
during world war i, he played a key role among those who advocated the allied cause, arguing that brazil should be more involved in the war.
barbosa died in petrópolis, near rio de janeiro, in 1923.

simón josé antonio de la santísima trinidad bolívar y palacios ponte-andrade y blanco (24 july 1783 – 17 december 1830), generally known as simón bolívar (spanish: [siˈmom boˈliβaɾ] (listen),[a] english: /ˈbɒlɪvər, -vɑːr/ bol-iv-ər, -⁠ar also us: /ˈboʊlɪvɑːr/ boh-liv-ar) and also colloquially as el libertador,  or the liberator, was a venezuelan military and political leader who led what are currently the states of venezuela, bolivia, colombia, ecuador, peru, and panama to independence from the spanish empire.
bolívar was born into a wealthy, aristocratic criollo family and, as was common for the heirs of upper-class families in his day, was sent to be educated abroad at a young age, arriving in spain when he was 16 and later moving to france.
while in europe he was introduced to the ideas of the enlightenment, which later motivated him to overthrow the reigning spanish in colonial south america.
taking advantage of the disorder in spain prompted by the peninsular war, bolívar began his campaign for independence in 1808. the campaign for the independence of new granada was consolidated with the victory at the battle of boyacá on 7 august 1819. he established an organized national congress within three years.
despite a number of hindrances, including the arrival of an unprecedentedly large spanish expeditionary force, the revolutionaries eventually prevailed, culminating in the patriot victory at the battle of carabobo in 1821, which effectively made venezuela an independent country.
following this triumph over the spanish monarchy, bolívar participated in the foundation of the first union of independent nations in latin america, gran colombia, of which he was president from 1819 to 1830. through further military campaigns, he ousted spanish rulers from ecuador, peru, and bolivia, the last of which was named after him.
he was simultaneously president of gran colombia (present-day venezuela, colombia, panama and ecuador), peru, and bolivia, but soon after, his second-in-command, antonio josé de sucre, was appointed president of bolivia.
bolívar aimed at a strong and united spanish america able to cope not only with the threats emanating from spain and the european holy alliance but also with the emerging power of the united states.
at the peak of his power, bolívar ruled over a vast territory from the argentine border to the caribbean sea.
bolívar fought 472 battles, of which 79 were important ones, and during his campaigns rode on horseback 123,000 kilometers, which is 10 times more than hannibal, three times more than napoleon, and twice as much as alexander the great.
bolívar is viewed as a national icon in much of modern south america, and is considered one of the great heroes of the hispanic independence movements of the early 19th century, along with josé de san martín, francisco de miranda and others.
towards the end of his life, bolívar despaired of the situation in his native region, with the famous quote "all who served the revolution have plowed the sea".
:450 in an address to the constituent congress of the republic of colombia, bolívar stated "fellow citizens!
i blush to say this: independence is the only benefit we have acquired, to the detriment of all the rest."
the surname bolívar originated with aristocrats from la puebla de bolívar, a small village in the basque country of spain.
bolívar's father came from the female line of the ardanza family.
his maternal grandmother was descended from families from the canary islands.
[b]
the bolívars settled in venezuela in the 16th century.
bolívar's first south american ancestor was simón de bolívar (or simon de bolibar; the spelling was not standardized until the 19th century), who lived and worked in santo domingo (the present-day dominican republic) from 1559 to 1560 and where his son simón de bolívar y castro was born.
when the governor was reassigned to venezuela by the spanish crown in 1569, simón de bolívar went with him.
as an early settler in spain's venezuela province, he became prominent in the local society, and he and his descendants were granted estates, encomiendas, and positions in the local cabildo.
when caracas cathedral was built in 1569, the bolívar family had one of the first dedicated side chapels.
the majority of the wealth of simón de bolívar's descendants came from the estates.
the most important was a sugar plantation with an encomienda that provided the labor needed to run the estate.
another portion of the bolívars' wealth came from silver, gold, and copper mines.
small gold deposits were first mined in venezuela in 1669, leading to the discovery of much more extensive copper deposits.
from his mother's side (the palacios family), bolívar inherited the aroa copper mines at cocorote.
native american and african slaves provided the majority of the labor in these mines.
toward the end of the 17th century, copper mining became so prominent in venezuela that the metal became known as cobre caracas ("caracas copper").
many of the mines became the property of the bolívar family.
bolívar's grandfather, juan de bolívar y martínez de villegas, paid 22,000 ducats to the monastery at santa maria de montserrat in 1728 for a title of nobility that had been granted by king philip v of spain for its maintenance.
the crown never issued the patent of nobility, and so the purchase became the subject of lawsuits that were still in progress during bolívar's lifetime, when independence from spain made the point moot.
(if the lawsuits had been successful, bolívar's older brother, juan vicente, would have become the marquess of san luis and viscount of cocorote.)
bolívar ultimately devoted his personal fortune to the revolution.
having been one of the wealthiest persons within the spanish american world at the beginning of the revolution, he died in poverty.
simón bolívar was born in a house in caracas, captaincy general of venezuela, on 24 july 1783.:6 he was baptized as simón josé antonio de la santísima trinidad bolívar y palacios.
his mother was maría de la concepción palacios y blanco, and his father was colonel don juan vicente bolívar y ponte.
he had two older sisters and a brother: maría antonia, juana, and juan vicente.
another sister, maría del carmen, died at birth.
when bolívar was an infant, he was cared for by doña ines manceba de miyares and the family's slave, hipólita.
a couple of years later, he returned to the care of his parents, but this experience would have a major effect on his life.
his father died before bolívar's third birthday to tuberculosis, and his mother died when he was almost nine.
after his mother's death, bolívar was placed in the custody of an instructor, miguel josé sanz, but this relationship did not work out and he was sent back home.
he went on to receive private lessons from the renowned professors andrés bello, guillermo pelgrón, jose antonio negrete, fernando vides, father andújar, and don simón rodríguez, formerly known as simón carreño.
don simón rodríguez became bolívar's teacher, friend and mentor.
he taught him how to swim and ride horses, as well as about liberty, human rights, politics, history, and sociology.
later in life, rodríguez was pivotal in bolívar's decision to start the revolution, instilling in him the ideas of liberty, enlightenment, and freedom.
in the meantime, bolívar was mostly cared for by his nurse, the slave hipólita, whom he later called "the only mother i have known".
when bolívar was fourteen, don simón rodríguez was forced to leave the country after being accused of involvement in a conspiracy against the spanish government in caracas.
bolívar then entered the military academy of the milicias de aragua.
in 1800, he was sent to spain to follow his military studies in madrid, where he remained until 1802. back in europe in 1804, he lived in france and traveled to different countries.
while in milan, bolívar witnessed the coronation of napoleon as king of italy (a kingdom in personal union with france in northern modern italy), an event that left a profound impression on him.
even if he disagreed with the crowning, he was highly sensitive to the popular veneration inspired by the hero.
bolívar returned to venezuela in 1807. after a coup on 19 april 1810, venezuela achieved de facto independence when the supreme junta of caracas was established and the colonial administrators deposed.
the supreme junta sent a delegation to great britain to get british recognition and aid.
this delegation presided by bolívar also included two future venezuelan notables andrés bello and luis lópez méndez.
the trio met with francisco de miranda and persuaded him to return to his native land.
in 1811, a delegation from the supreme junta, also including bolívar, and a crowd of commoners enthusiastically received miranda in la guaira.
during the insurgence war conducted by miranda, bolívar was promoted to colonel and was made commandant of puerto cabello the following year, 1812. as royalist frigate captain domingo de monteverde was advancing into republican territory from the west, bolívar lost control of san felipe castle along with its ammunition stores on 30 june 1812. bolívar then retreated to his estate in san mateo.
miranda saw the republican cause as lost and signed a capitulation agreement with monteverde on 25 july, an action that bolívar and other revolutionary officers deemed treasonous.
in one of bolívar's most morally dubious acts, he and others arrested miranda and handed him over to the spanish royal army at the port of la guaira.
for his apparent services to the royalist cause, monteverde granted bolívar a passport, and bolívar left for curaçao on 27 august.
it must be said, though, that bolívar protested to the spanish authorities about the reasons why he handled miranda, insisting that he was not lending a service to the crown but punishing a defector.
in 1813, he was given a military command in tunja, new granada (modern-day colombia), under the direction of the congress of united provinces of new granada, which had formed out of the juntas established in 1810.
this was the beginning of the admirable campaign.
on 24 may, bolívar entered mérida, where he was proclaimed el libertador ("the liberator").
this was followed by the occupation of trujillo on 9 june.
six days later, and as a result of spanish massacres on independence supporters,  bolívar dictated his famous "decree of war to the death", allowing the killing of any spaniard not actively supporting independence.
caracas was retaken on 6 august 1813, and bolívar was ratified as el libertador, establishing the second republic of venezuela.
the following year, because of the rebellion of josé tomás boves and the fall of the republic, bolívar returned to new granada, where he commanded a force for the united provinces.
his forces entered bogotá in 1814 and recaptured the city from the dissenting republican forces of cundinamarca.
bolívar intended to march into cartagena and enlist the aid of local forces in order to capture the royalist town of santa marta.
in 1815, however, after a number of political and military disputes with the government of cartagena, bolívar fled to jamaica, where he was denied support.
after an assassination attempt in jamaica, he fled to haiti, where he was granted protection.
he befriended alexandre pétion, the president of the recently independent southern republic (as opposed to the kingdom of haiti in the north), and petitioned him for aid.
—simón bolívar
in 1816, with haitian soldiers and vital material support, bolívar landed in venezuela and fulfilled his promise to pétion to free spanish america's slaves on 2 june 1816.:186
in july 1817, on a second expedition, he captured angostura after defeating the counter-attack of miguel de la torre.
:192–201 however, venezuela remained a captaincy of spain after the victory in 1818 by pablo morillo in the second battle of la puerta (es).
:212
on 15 february 1819, bolívar was able to open the venezuelan second national congress in angostura, in which he was elected president and francisco antonio zea was elected vice president.
:222–25 bolívar then decided that he would first fight for the independence of new granada, to gain resources of the vice royalty, intending later to consolidate the independence of venezuela.
the campaign for the independence of new granada, which included the crossing of the andes mountain range, one of history's military feats, was consolidated with the victory at the battle of boyacá on 7 august 1819.:233  bolívar returned to angostura, when congress passed a law forming a greater republic of colombia on 17 december, making bolívar president and zea vice president, with francisco de paula santander vice president on the new granada side, and juan germán roscio vice president on the venezuela side.
:246–47
morillo was left in control of caracas and the coastal highlands.
:248 after the restoration of the cádiz constitution, morillo ratified two treaties with bolívar on 25 november 1820, calling for a six-month armistice and recognizing bolívar as president of the republic.
:254–55  bolívar and morillo met in san fernando de apure on 27 november, after which morillo left venezuela for spain, leaving la torre in command.
:255–57
from his newly consolidated base of power, bolívar launched outright independence campaigns in venezuela and ecuador.
these campaigns concluded with the victory at the battle of carabobo, after which bolívar triumphantly entered caracas on 29 june 1821.:267 on 7 september 1821, gran colombia (a state covering much of modern colombia, ecuador, panama, and venezuela) was created, with bolívar as president and santander as vice president.
bolívar followed with the battle of bombona and the battle of pichincha, after which he entered quito on 16 june 1822.:287 on 26 and 27 july 1822, bolívar held the guayaquil conference with the argentine general josé de san martín, who had received the title of "protector of peruvian freedom" in august 1821 after partially liberating peru from the spanish.
:295 thereafter, bolívar took over the task of fully liberating peru.
the peruvian congress named him dictator of peru on 10 february 1824, which allowed bolívar to reorganize completely the political and military administration.
assisted by antonio josé de sucre, bolívar decisively defeated the spanish cavalry at the battle of junín on 6 august 1824. sucre destroyed the still numerically superior remnants of the spanish forces at ayacucho on 9 december 1824.
according to british historian robert harvey:
bolívar achievements in peru had been as staggering as any in his career of a year, from holding a strip of the country's north coast while himself nearly moribund, he and sucre had taken on and defeated an army of 18,000 men and secured a country the size of nearly all of western europe...the investment of personal energy, the distances covered and the four army expeditions across supposedly impassable mountain ranges had qualified him for superhuman status...his stamina and military achievements put him at the forefront of the global heroes of history.
writing to united states secretary of state john quincy adams in 1824, united states consul in peru william tudor stated:
unfortunately for peru, the invaders who came to proclaim liberty and independence were cruel, rapacious, unprincipled and incapable.
their mismanagement, their profligacy, and their thirst for plunder soon alienated the affections of the inhabitants.
even though bolívar condemned the corrupt practices of the spanish, he ordered some churches stripped of their decorations.
on 19 march 1824, josé gabriel pérez wrote to antonio josé de sucre about the orders given to him by bolívar; pérez talked about "all the ordinary and extraordinary means" that should be applied to assure the subsistence of the patriot army.
indeed, pérez said that bolívar issued instructions to take from churches "all golden and silver jewels" in order to coin them and pay war expenditures.
days later, bolívar himself said to sucre that there would be a complete lack of resources unless severe actions were taken against "the jewels of the churches, everywhere".
on 6 august 1825, at the congress of upper peru, the "republic of bolivia" was created.
:346 bolívar is thus one of the few people to have a country named after him.
bolívar returned to caracas on 12 january 1827, and then back to bogotá.
:369, 378, 408
bolívar had great difficulties maintaining control of the vast gran colombia.
in 1826, internal divisions sparked dissent throughout the nation, and regional uprisings erupted in venezuela.
the new south american union had revealed its fragility and appeared to be on the verge of collapse.
to preserve the union, an amnesty was declared and an arrangement was reached with the venezuelan rebels, but this increased the political dissent in neighboring new granada.
in an attempt to keep the nation together as a single entity, bolívar called for a constitutional convention at ocaña in march 1828.
bolívar thought that a federation like the one founded in the united states was unworkable in the spanish america.
:106, 166 for this reason, and to prevent a break-up, bolívar sought to implement a more centralist model of government in gran colombia, including some or all of the elements of the bolivian constitution he had written, which included a lifetime presidency with the ability to select a successor (although this presidency was to be held in check by an intricate system of balances).
:351
this move was considered controversial in new granada and was one of the reasons for the deliberations, which met from 9 april to 10 june 1828. the convention almost ended up drafting a document which would have implemented a radically federalist form of government, which would have greatly reduced the powers of a central administration.
the federalist faction was able to command a majority for the draft of a new constitution which has definite federal characteristics despite its ostensibly centralist outline.
unhappy with what would be the ensuing result, pro-bolívar delegates withdrew from the convention, leaving it moribund.
two months after the failure of this congress to write a new constitution, bolívar was declared president-liberator in colombia's "organic decree".
:394 he considered this a temporary measure, as a means to reestablish his authority and save the republic, although it increased dissatisfaction and anger among his political opponents.
:408 an assassination attempt on 25 september 1828 failed (in spanish it is indeed known as the noche septembrina), thanks to the help of his lover, manuela sáenz.
:399–405 bolívar afterward described manuela as "liberatrix of the liberator".
:403 dissent continued, and uprisings occurred in new granada, venezuela, and ecuador during the next two years.
bolivar initially tried to forgive those who were considered conspirators, members of the "santander" faction.
eventually it was decided to submit them to martial justice, after which those accused of being directly involved were executed, some without having their guilt fully established.
santander, who had known in advance of the conspiracy and had not directly opposed it because of his differences with bolivar, was condemned to death.
bolivar, though, commuted the sentence.
after the facts, bolivar continued to govern in a rarefied environment, cornered by fractional disputes.
uprisings occurred in new granada, venezuela, and ecuador during the following two years.
the separatists accused him of betraying republican principles and of wanting to establish a permanent dictatorship.
gran colombia declared war against peru when president general la mar invaded guayaquil.
he was later defeated by marshall antonio josé de sucre in the battle of the portete de tarqui, 27 february 1829. sucre was killed on 4 june 1830. general juan josé flores wanted to separate the southern departments (quito, guayaquil, and azuay), known as the district of ecuador, from gran colombia to form an independent country and become its first president.
venezuela was proclaimed independent on 13 january 1830 and josé antonio páez maintained the presidency of that country, banishing bolivar.
for bolívar, hispanic america was the fatherland.
he dreamed of a united spanish america and in the pursuit of that purpose he not only created gran colombia but also the confederation of the andes whose aim was to unite the aforementioned with peru and bolivia.
moreover, he promoted a network of treaties keeping the newly liberated south american countries together.
nonetheless, he was unable to control the centrifugal process which pushed outwards in all directions.
on 20 january 1830, as his dream fell apart, bolívar delivered his final address to the nation, announcing that he would be stepping down from the presidency of gran colombia.
in his speech, a distraught bolívar urged the people to maintain the union and to be wary of the intentions of those who advocated for separation.
(at the time, "colombians" referred to the people of gran colombia (venezuela, new granada, and ecuador), not modern-day colombia):
simón bolívar
colombians!
today i cease to govern you.
i have served you for twenty years as soldier and leader.
during this long period we have taken back our country, liberated three republics, fomented many civil wars, and four times i have returned to the people their omnipotence, convening personally four constitutional congresses.
these services were inspired by your virtues, your courage, and your patriotism; mine is the great privilege of having governed you.
the constitutional congress convened on this day is charged by providence with the task of giving the nation the institutions she desires, following the course of circumstances and the nature of things.
fearing that i may be regarded as an obstacle to establishing the republic on the true base of its happiness, i personally have cast myself down from the supreme position of leadership to which your generosity had elevated me.
colombians!
i have been the victim of ignominious suspicions, with no possible way to defend the purity of my principles.
the same persons who aspire to the supreme command have conspired to tear your hearts from me, attributing to me their own motives, making me seem to be the instigator of projects they themselves have conceived, representing me, finally, as aspiring to a crown which they themselves have offered on more than one occasion and which i have rejected with the indignation of the fiercest republican.
never, never, i swear to you, has it crossed my mind to aspire to a kingship that my enemies have fabricated in order to ruin me in your regard.
do not be deceived, colombians!
my only desire has been to contribute to your freedom and to be the preservation of your peace of mind.
if for this i am held guilty, i deserve your censure more than any man.
do not listen, i beg you, to the vile slander and the tawdry envy stirring up discord on all sides.
will you allow yourself to be deceived by the false accusations of my detractors?
please don't be foolish!
colombians!
gather around the constitutional congress.
it represents the wisdom of the nation, the legitimate hope of the people, and the final point of reunion of the patriots.
its sovereign decrees will determine our lives, the happiness of the republic, and the glory of colombia.
if dire circumstances should cause you to abandon it, there will be no health for the country, and you will drown in the ocean of anarchy, leaving as your children's legacy nothing but crime, blood, and death.
fellow countrymen!
hear my final plea as i end my political career; in the name of colombia i ask you, beg you, to remain united, lest you become the assassins of the country and your own executioners.
bolívar
bolívar ultimately failed in his attempt to prevent the collapse of the union.
gran colombia was dissolved later that year and was replaced by the republics of venezuela, new granada, and ecuador.
ironically, these countries were established as centralist nations, and would be governed for decades this way by leaders who, during bolívar's last years, had accused him of betraying republican principles and of wanting to establish a permanent dictatorship.
these separatists, among them josé antonio páez and francisco de paula santander, had justified their opposition to bolívar for this reason and publicly denounced him as a monarch.
some of them had in the past been accused of plotting against bolívar's life (santander, who governed the second centralist government of new granada, was associated with the september conspiracy).
josé maría obando, the first president of the republic of new granada (that succeeded the gran colombia), had been directly linked to the assassination of antonio josé de sucre in 1830. sucre was regarded by some as a political threat because of his popularity after he led a resounding patriot victory at the battle of ayacucho, ending the war against the spanish empire in south america.
bolívar also considered him his direct successor and had attempted to make him vice president of gran colombia after francisco de paula santander was exiled in 1828.
for the rest of the 19th century and into the early 20th century, the political environment of latin america was fraught with civil wars and characterized by a sociopolitical phenomenon known as caudillismo, which became very common in venezuela, especially after 1830.
indeed, such struggles already existed shortly after the patriot victory over the loyalists because the former spanish colonies created new nations that proclaimed their own autonomous states, which produced military confrontations with political conspirations that sent some of the former independence heroes into exile.
moreover, there were attempts by the spanish monarchy to reconquer their former settlements in the americas through expeditions that would help the remaining loyalist forces and advocates.
however, the attempts generally failed in venezuela, perú and mexico; thus, the loyalist resistance forces against the republic were finally defeated.
the main characteristic of caudillismo was the arrival of authoritarian but charismatic political figures who would typically rise to power in an unconventional way, often legitimizing their right to govern through undemocratic processes.
these caudillos maintained their control primarily on the basis of their personalities, as well as skewed interpretations of their popularity and what constituted a majority among the masses.
on his deathbed, bolívar envisaged the emergence of countless caudillos competing for the pieces of the great nation he once dreamed about.
saying that "all who served the revolution have plowed the sea",:450 bolívar finally resigned the presidency on 27 april 1830, intending to leave the country for exile in europe.
:435 he had already sent several crates containing his belongings and writings ahead of him to europe, but he died before setting sail from cartagena.
on 17 december 1830, at the age of 47, simón bolívar died of tuberculosis in the quinta de san pedro alejandrino in santa marta, gran colombia (now colombia).
on his deathbed, bolívar asked his aide-de-camp, general daniel f. o'leary, to burn the remaining extensive archive of his writings, letters, and speeches.
o'leary disobeyed the order and his writings survived, providing historians with a wealth of information about bolívar's liberal philosophy and thought, as well as details of his personal life, such as his long love affair with manuela sáenz.
shortly before her own death in 1856, sáenz augmented this collection by giving o'leary her own letters from bolívar.
bolívar's remains were buried in the cathedral of santa marta.
twelve years later, in 1842, at the request of president josé antonio páez, they were moved from santa marta to caracas, where they were buried in the cathedral of caracas together with the remains of his wife and parents.
in 1876, he was moved to a monument set up for his interment at the national pantheon of venezuela.
the quinta near santa marta has been preserved as a museum with numerous references to his life.
in 2010, symbolic remains of bolívar's later-years lover, manuela sáenz, were also interred in venezuela's national pantheon.
on january 2008, then-president of venezuela hugo chávez set up a commission to investigate theories that bolívar was the victim of an assassination.
on several occasions, chávez has claimed that bolívar was in fact poisoned by "new granada traitors".
in april 2010, infectious diseases specialist paul auwaerter studied records of bolívar's symptoms and concluded that he might have suffered from chronic arsenic poisoning, but that both acute poisoning and murder were unlikely.
in july 2010, bolívar's body was ordered to be exhumed to advance the investigations.
in july 2011, international forensics experts released their report, claiming there was no proof of poisoning or any other unnatural cause of death.
in 1799, following the early deaths of his father juan vicente (dead since 1786) and his mother concepción (who died in 1792), bolívar traveled to mexico, france, and spain, at the age of 16 years, to complete his education.
while in madrid during 1802 and after a two-year courtship, he married maría teresa rodríguez del toro y alaiza, who was to be his only wife.
she was related to the aristocratic families of the marquis del toro of caracas and the marquis de inicio of madrid.
eight months after returning to venezuela with him, she died from yellow fever on 22 january 1803. bolívar was so devastated by this loss that his relatives feared for his life.
he swore never to marry again, a promise he kept.
many years later bolívar would refer to the death of his wife as the turning point of his life.
indeed, in 1828, he told luis perú de lacroix the following words:
not surprisingly, spanish historian salvador de madariaga refers to the death of bolivar's wife as one of the key moments in hispanic america's history.
in 1804, he traveled again to europe in an attempt to ease his pain and began falling into a dissolute life.
it was then that he met again with his old teacher simón rodríguez in paris, who little by little was able to transform his acute depression into a sense of commitment towards a greater cause: the independence of venezuela.
he lived in napoleonic france for a while and undertook the grand tour.
during this time in europe, bolívar met the intellectual explorer, alexander von humboldt in rome.
humboldt later wrote: "i was wrong back then, when i judged him a puerile man, incapable of realizing so grand an ambition.
":64
bolívar had several love affairs.
most of them were ephemeral and did not last long.
historians, scholars and biographers often agree with the names of the most prominent women who stood with bolívar, such as josefina "pepita" machado, fanny du villars and manuela sáenz.
manuela sáenz was the most important of those women.
she was more than a lover in bolívar's later life; she became a trustworthy confidant and advisor.
moreover, manuela saved bolívar's life during the september conspiracy of 1828 in which bolívar was about to be killed.
during such assassination attempt, manuela diverted the assassins and thus gave bolívar enough time to escape from his room.
bolívar and manuela met in quito on 22 june 1822 and they began a long-term affair.
the relationship was controversial at the time, because manuela was already married to james thorne, but they became estranged in 1822 due to irreconcilable differences.
the emotional ties between manuela and bolívar were strong, and manuela attempted suicide when she received the news of bolívar's death.
despite sometimes living in the same south american cities (such as bogotá, quito and lima), bolívar and manuela did not always have a face-to-face relationship.
this romance was clear in their letters, but few of them have survived.
most of her letters were destroyed after manuela's death.
contrary to the arguments exposed by heinz dieterich, carlos álvarez saá, and a book edited by fundación editorial el perro y la rana publishing house in 2007, several letters attributed to both bolívar and manuela are intentional forgeries.
in his memoirs of simón bolívar, henri la fayette villaume ducoudray holstein (who himself has been called a "not-always-reliable and never impartial witness") described the young bolívar as he was attempting to seize power in venezuela and new granada in 1814–1816.
ducoudray holstein joined bolívar and served on his staff as an officer during this period.
he describes bolívar as a coward who repeatedly abandoned his military commission in front of the enemy, and also as a great lover of women, being accompanied at all times by two or more of his mistresses during the military operations.
he would not hesitate to stop the fleet transporting the whole army and bound for margarita island during two days in order to wait for his mistress to join his ship.
according to ducoudray holstein, bolívar behaved essentially as an opportunist preferring intrigues and secret manipulation to an open fight.
he was also deemed incompetent in military matters, systematically avoiding any risks and permanently anxious for his own safety.
in the diario de bucaramanga, bolívar's opinion of ducoudray is presented when louis peru de lacroix asked who had been bolívar's aides-de-camp since he had been general; he mentioned charles eloi demarquet and ducoudray.
bolívar confirmed the first but denied the second, saying that he had met him in 1815 and accepted his services, even admitting him to his general staff, but "i never trusted him enough to make him my aide-de-camp; to the contrary, i had a very unfavorable idea of his person and his services", and that ducoudray's departure after only a brief stay had been a "real pleasure."
karl marx
according to beddow and thibodeaux, karl marx dismissed bolívar as a "falsifier, deserter, conspirator, liar, coward and looter", and a "false liberator who merely sought to preserve the power of the old creole nobility to which he belonged".
in an unsympathetic biography titled bolívar y ponte, simón, published in the new american cyclopedia, karl marx criticized much of bolívar's life.
marx begins by saying that bolívar was born to a family of "creole nobility in venezuela" and that similar to the "custom of wealthy americans of those times, at the early age of 14 he was sent to europe".
at several points in marx's piece, he complains that bolívar abandoned his troops multiple times and writes that bolívar had to be persuaded by his cousin ribas to return to fight against the spanish after staying in cartagena.
marx then penned that after arriving in caracas in 1813, bolívar's "dictatorship soon proved a military anarchy, leaving the most important affairs in the hands of favorites, who squandered the finances of the country, and then resorted to odious means in order to restore them".
at the conclusion of the biography, marx uses ducoudray holstein's description of bolívar.
bolívar had no children, possibly because of infertility caused by having contracted measles and mumps as a child.
his closest living relatives descend from his sisters and brother.
one of his sisters died in infancy.
his sister juana bolívar y palacios married their maternal uncle, dionisio palacios y blanco, and had two children, guillermo and benigna.
guillermo palacios died fighting alongside his uncle simón in the battle of la hogaza on 2 december 1817. benigna had two marriages, the first to pedro briceño méndez and the second to pedro amestoy.
their great-grandchildren, bolívar's closest living relatives, pedro, and eduardo mendoza goiticoa lived in caracas as of 2009.
his eldest sister, maría antonia, married pablo clemente francia and had four children: josefa, anacleto, valentina, and pablo.
maría antonia became bolívar's agent to deal with his properties while he served as president of gran colombia and she was an executrix of his will.
she retired to bolívar's estate in macarao, which she inherited from him.
his older brother, juan vicente, who died in 1811 on a diplomatic mission to the united states, had three children born out of wedlock whom he recognized: juan, fernando simón, and felicia bolívar tinoco.
bolívar provided for the children and their mother after his brother's death.
bolívar was especially close to fernando and in 1822 sent him to study in the united states, where he attended the university of virginia.
in his long life, fernando had minor participation in some of the major political events of venezuelan history and also traveled and lived extensively throughout europe.
he had three children, benjamín bolívar gauthier, santiago hernández bolívar, and claudio bolívar taraja.
fernando died in 1898 at the age of 88.
simón bolívar was an admirer of both the u.s. and french revolutions.
:35, 52–53 bolívar even enrolled his nephew, fernando bolívar, in a private school in philadelphia, germantown academy, and paid for his education, including attendance at thomas jefferson's university of virginia.
:71–72, 369 while he was an admirer of u.s. independence, he did not believe that its governmental system could work in latin america.
thus, he claimed that the governance of heterogeneous societies like venezuela "will require a firm hand".
bolívar felt that the u.s. had been established in land especially fertile for democracy.
by contrast, he referred to spanish america as having been subject to the "triple yoke of ignorance, tyranny, and vice".
:224 if a republic could be established in such a land, in his mind, it would have to make some concessions in terms of liberty.
this is shown when bolívar blamed the fall of the first republic on his subordinates trying to imitate "some ethereal republic" and in the process, not paying attention to the gritty political reality of south america.
among the books accompanying him as he traveled were adam smith's the wealth of nations, voltaire's letters and, when he was writing the bolivian constitution, montesquieu's the spirit of the laws.
his bolivian constitution placed him within the camp of what would become latin american conservatism in the later nineteenth century.
the bolivian constitution intended to establish a lifelong presidency and a hereditary senate, essentially recreating the british unwritten constitution, as it existed at the time.
according to carlos fuentes:
how to govern ourselves after winning independence.
it can be said that the liberator exhausted his soul trying to find an answer to that question...bolívar tried to avoid the extremes that would overwhelm spanish america all along the nineteenth century and part of the twentieth.
tyranny or anarchy?
'do not aim at what is impossible to attain, because in the quest for liberty we may fall into tyranny.
absolute liberty always leads to absolute power and among these two extremes is social liberty'.
in order to find this equilibrium, bolívar proposed a 'clever despotism', a strong executive power able to impose equality there where racial inequality prevailed.
bolívar warned against an 'aristocracy of rank, employment and fortune' that while 'referring to liberty and guarantee' it would just be for themselves but not for levelling with members of lower classes'...he is the disciple of montesquieu in his insistence that institutions have to be adapted to culture.
similarly to some others in the history of american independence (george washington, miguel hidalgo, josé de san martín, bernardo o'higgins, francisco de paula santander, antonio nariño, and francisco de miranda), simón bolívar was a freemason.
he was initiated in 1803 in the masonic lodge lautaro, which operated in cádiz, spain,.
it was in this lodge that he first met some of his revolutionary peers, such as josé de san martín.
in may 1806 he was conferred the rank of master mason in the "scottish mother of st. alexander of scotland" in paris.
during his time in london, he frequented "the great american reunion" lodge in london, founded by francisco de miranda.
in april 1824, simón bolívar was given the 33rd degree of inspector general honorary.
he founded the masonic lodge no.
2 of peru, named "order and liberty".
due to the historical relevance of bolívar as a key element during the process of independence in hispanic america, his memory has been strongly attached to sentiments of nationalism and patriotism, being a recurrent theme of rhetoric in politics.
since the image of bolívar became an important part to the national identities of venezuela, colombia, panama, ecuador, peru and bolivia, his mantle is often claimed by hispanic american politicians all across the political spectrum.
[citation needed]
in venezuela, bolívar left behind a militarist legacy with multiple governments utilizing the memory, image and written legacy of bolívar as important parts of their political messages and propaganda.
bolívar disapproved of the excesses of "party spirit" and "factions", which led to an anti-political environment in venezuela.
for much of the 1800s, venezuela was ruled by caudillos, with six rebellions occurring to take control of venezuela between 1892 and 1900 alone.
the militarist legacy was then used by the nationalist dictatorship of marcos pérez jiménez and more recently the socialist political movement led by hugo chávez.
the nations of bolivia and the bolivarian republic of venezuela, and their respective currencies (the bolivian boliviano and the venezuelan bolívar), are all named after bolívar.
additionally, most cities and towns in colombia and venezuela are built around a main square known as plaza bolívar, as is the case with bogotá.
in this example, most governmental buildings and public structures are located on or around the plaza, including the national capitol and the palace of justice.
besides quito and caracas, there are monuments to bolívar in the latin american capitals of lima, buenos aires, havana, mexico city, panama city, paramaribo, san josé, santo domingo and sucre.
in bogotá, the simón bolívar park has hosted many concerts.
outside of latin america, the variety of monuments to simón bolívar are a continuing testament to his legacy.
these include statues in many capitals around the world, including algiers, ankara,[citation needed] bucharest, london, minsk, moscow, new delhi, ottawa, paris, prague, port-au-prince, rome, sofia, tehran, vienna and washington, d.c.. several cities in spain, especially in the basque country, have constructed monuments to bolívar, including a large monument in bilbao and a comprehensive venezuelan government-funded museum in cenarruza-puebla de bolívar, his ancestral hometown.
in the usa, an imposing bronze equestrian statue of simón bolívar stands at the southern entrance to central park at the avenue of the americas in new york city which also celebrates bolívar's contributions to latin america.
the bolivar peninsula in texas, bolivar county, mississippi, bolivar, new york, bolivar, west virginia and bolivar, tennessee are also named in his honor.
monuments to bolívar's military legacy also comprise one of venezuelan navy's sail training barques, which is named after him, and the uss simon bolivar, a benjamin franklin-class fleet ballistic missile submarine which served with the u.s. navy between 1965 and 1995.
minor planet 712 boliviana discovered by max wolf is named in his honor.
the name was suggested by camille flammarion.
the first venezuelan satellite, venesat-1, was given the alternative name simón bolívar after him.
his birthday is a public holiday in venezuela and bolivia.

bolívar has been depicted in opera, literature, film, and other media, and continues to be a part of the popular culture in many countries.
in 1883, to celebrate 100 years since his birth, the italian musician nicolò gabrielli composed the triumphal march simón bolívar and dedicated it to then president of venezuela antonio guzmán blanco.
in 1943 darius milhaud composed the opera bolívar.
he is also the central character in gabriel garcía márquez's 1989 novel the general in his labyrinth, in which he is portrayed in a less heroic but more humane manner than in most other parts of his legacy.
in 1969 maximilian schell played the role of simón bolívar in the film of the same name by director alessandro blasetti, which also featured actress rosanna schiaffino.
bolívar's life was also the basis of the 2013 film libertador, starring édgar ramírez and directed by alberto arvelo.
in an episode of the spanish tv series the ministry of time, "tiempo de ilustrados (time of the enlightened)", the time agents help him win the heart of his future wife, as this was considered fundamental for bolívar to fulfil his destiny.
later in the second season of the series the time agents will find him again in 1828 (two years before his death) to avoid his murder, planned by santander’s followers.
as of 2019, a netflix series has been released depicting bolívar's life and the major events surrounding it.
the netflix series is a colombian production with spanish as the main language.

gabriel tarde (french: [taʁd]; in full jean-gabriel de tarde; 12 march 1843 – 13 may 1904) was a french sociologist, criminologist and social psychologist who conceived  sociology as based on small psychological interactions among individuals (much as if it were chemistry), the fundamental forces being imitation and innovation.
tarde was born in sarlat in the province of dordogne, and he studied law at toulouse and paris.
from 1869 to 1894 he worked as a magistrate and investigating judge in the province.
in the 1880s he corresponded with representatives of the newly formed criminal anthropology, most notably the italians enrico ferri and cesare lombroso and the french psychiatrist alexandre lacassagne.
with the latter, tarde came to be the leading representative for a "french school" in criminology.
in 1900 he was appointed professor in modern philosophy at the collège de france.
as such he was the most prominent contemporary critic of durkheim's sociology.
among the concepts that tarde initiated were the group mind (taken up and developed by gustave le bon, and sometimes advanced to explain so-called herd behaviour or crowd psychology), and economic psychology, where he anticipated a number of modern developments.
tarde was very critical of émile durkheim's work at the level of both methodology and theory.
however, durkheim's sociology overshadowed tarde's insights, and it was not until u.s. scholars, such as the chicago school, took up his theories that they became famous.
tarde took an interest in criminology and the psychological basis of criminal behavior while working as a magistrate in public service.
he was critical of the concept of the atavistic criminal as developed by cesare lombroso.
tarde's criminological studies served as the underpinning of his later sociology.
tarde also emphasized the tendency of the criminal to return to the scene of the crime and to repeat it, which he saw as part of a wider process of repetition compulsion.
tarde considered imitation, conscious and unconscious, as a fundamental interpersonal trait, with the imitation of fathers by sons as the primal situation, resting on prestige.
tarde highlighted the importance of the creative exemplar in society, arguing that "genius is the capacity to engender one's own progeny".
tarde also wrote a science-fiction novel entitled underground man (fragment d'histoire future, 1896).
the plot is a post-apocalyptic story of an earth destroyed by a new ice age.
humanity must rebuild a new civilization underground.
the choice is made to lay the foundation of their utopia on music and art.
for example, it has recently been revealed that in difference and repetition, deleuze's milestone book which affected his transition to a more socially-aware brand of philosophy and his writing partnership with guattari, deleuze in fact re-centered his philosophical orientation around tarde's thesis that repetition serves difference rather than vice versa.
also on the heels of the re-release of tarde's works has come an important development in which french sociologist bruno latour has referred to tarde as a possible predecessor to actor-network theory in part because of tarde's criticisms of durkheim's conceptions of the social.
a book, the social after gabriel tarde: debates and assessments, edited by matei candea, was published by routledge in 2010. it provides a set of mature critiques of the recent renaissance of tarde as well as suggesting models for scholars to use tarde's thought in their scholarship.
this book includes contributions that philosophically reflect the latourian (including a contribution from latour himself) as well as deleuzian approaches to tarde, and also highlight a number of new ways tarde is being adapted in terms of methods in contemporary sociology, particularly in the area of ethnography, and the study of online communities.
additionally, in 2010, bruno latour and vincent antonin lepinay released a short book called the science of passionate interests: an introduction to gabriel tarde's economic anthropology, in which they show how tarde's work offers a strong critique of the foundations of the economics discipline and economic methodology.
tarde's work has further influenced affect philosophy.
for example, in 2012 tony d sampson's book virality: contagion theory in the age of networks used a tarde inspired imitation thesis to describe the tendency for emotions, feelings and affects to spread "accidentally" on digital networks.

in the books of samuel, david is a young shepherd who gains fame first as a musician and later by killing the enemy champion goliath.
he becomes a favorite of king saul and a close friend of saul's son jonathan.
worried that david is trying to take his throne, saul turns on david.
after saul and jonathan are killed in battle, david is anointed as king.
david conquers jerusalem, taking the ark of the covenant into the city, and establishing the kingdom founded by saul.
as king, david commits adultery with bathsheba, leading him to arrange the death of her husband uriah the hittite.
because of this sin, david's son absalom tries to overthrow him.
david flees jerusalem during absalom's rebellion, but after absalom's death he returns to the city to rule israel.
because david shed much blood, god denies david the opportunity to build the temple.
before his peaceful death, he chooses his son solomon as successor.
he is honored in the prophetic literature as an ideal king and the forefather of a future messiah, and many psalms are ascribed to him.
historians of the ancient near east agree that david probably existed around 1000 bce, but that there is little that can be said about him as a historical figure.
it was initially thought that there was no evidence outside of the bible concerning david, but the tel dan stele, an inscribed stone erected by a king of damascus in the late 9th/early 8th centuries bce to commemorate his victory over two enemy kings, contains the phrase in hebrew: ביתדוד‎, bytdwd, which most scholars translate as "house of david".
ancient near east historians generally doubt that the united monarchy as described in the bible existed.
david is richly represented in post-biblical jewish written and oral tradition, and is discussed in the new testament.
early christians interpreted the life of jesus in light of the references to the messiah and to david; jesus is described as being descended from david.
david is discussed in the quran as a major prophet and figures in islamic oral and written tradition as well.
the biblical character of david has inspired many interpretations in art and literature over centuries.
the first book of samuel and the first book of chronicles both identify david as the son of jesse, the bethlehemite, the youngest of eight sons.
he also had at least two sisters, zeruiah, whose sons all went on to serve in david's army, and abigail, whose son amasa went on to serve in absalom's army, absalom being one of david's younger sons.
while the bible does not name his mother, the talmud identifies her as nitzevet, a daughter of a man named adael, and the book of ruth claims him as the great-grandson of ruth, the moabite, by boaz.
david is described as cementing his relations with various political and national groups through marriage.
king saul initially offered david his oldest daughter, merab.
david did not refuse the offer, but humbled himself in front of saul to be considered among the king's family.
saul reneged and instead gave merab in marriage to adriel the meholathite.
having been told that his younger daughter michal was in love with david, saul gave her in marriage to david upon david's payment in philistine foreskins (ancient jewish historian josephus lists the dowry as 600 philistine heads).
saul became jealous of david and tried to have him killed.
david escaped.
then saul sent michal to galim to marry palti, son of laish.
david then took wives in hebron, according to 2 samuel 3; they were ahinoam the yizre'elite; abigail, the wife of nabal the carmelite; maacah, the daughter of talmay, king of geshur; haggith; abital; and eglah.
later, david wanted michal back and abner, ish-bosheth's army commander, delivered her to david, causing her husband (palti) great grief.
the book of chronicles lists his sons with his various wives and concubines.
in hebron, david had six sons: amnon, by ahinoam; daniel, by abigail; absalom, by maachah; adonijah, by haggith; shephatiah, by abital; and ithream, by eglah.
by bathsheba, his sons were shammua, shobab, nathan, and solomon.
david's sons born in jerusalem of his other wives included ibhar, elishua, eliphelet, nogah, nepheg, japhia, elishama and eliada.
jerimoth, who is not mentioned in any of the genealogies, is mentioned as another of his sons in 2 chronicles 11:18. his daughter tamar, by maachah, is raped by her half-brother amnon.
david fails to bring amnon to justice for his violation of tamar, because he is his firstborn and he loves him, and so, absalom murders amnon to avenge tamar.
god is angered when saul, israel's king, unlawfully offers a sacrifice and later disobeys a divine command both to kill all of the amalekites and to destroy their confiscated property.
consequently, god sends the prophet samuel to anoint a shepherd, david, the youngest son of jesse of bethlehem, to be king instead.
after god sends an evil spirit to torment saul, his servants recommend that he send for a man skilled in playing the lyre.
a servant proposes david, whom the servant describes as "skillful in playing, a man of valor, a warrior, prudent in speech, and a man of good presence; and the lord is with him."
david enters saul's service as one of the royal armour-bearers and plays the lyre to soothe the king.
war comes between israel and the philistines, and the giant goliath challenges the israelites to send out a champion to face him in single combat.
david, sent by his father to bring provisions to his brothers serving in saul's army, declares that he can defeat goliath.
refusing the king's offer of the royal armour, he kills goliath with his sling.
saul inquires the name of the young hero's father.
saul sets david over his army.
all israel loves david, but his popularity causes saul to fear him ("what else can he wish but the kingdom?").
saul plots his death, but saul's son jonathan, one of those who loves david, warns him of his father's schemes and david flees.
he goes first to nob, where he is fed by the priest ahimelech and given goliath's sword, and then to gath, the philistine city of goliath, intending to seek refuge with king achish there.
achish's servants or officials question his loyalty, and david sees that he is in danger there.
he goes next to the cave of adullam, where his family join him.
from there he goes to seek refuge with the king of moab, but the prophet gad advises him to leave and he goes to the forest of hereth, and then to keilah, where he is involved in a further battle with the philistines.
saul plans to besiege keilah so that he can capture david, so david leaves the city in order to protect its inhabitants.
from there he takes refuge in the mountainous wilderness of ziph.
jonathan meets with david again and confirms his loyalty to david as the future king.
after the people of ziph notify saul that david is taking refuge in their territory, saul seeks confirmation and plans to capture david in the wilderness of maon, but his attention is diverted by a renewed philistine invasion and david is able to secure some respite at ein gedi.
returning from battle with the philistines, saul heads to ein gedi in pursuit of david and enters the cave where, as it happens, david and his supporters are hiding, "to attend to his needs".
david realises he has an opportunity to kill saul, but this is not his intention: he secretly cuts off a corner of saul's robe, and when saul has left the cave he comes out to pay homage to saul as the king and to demonstrate, using the piece of robe, that he holds no malice towards saul.
the two are thus reconciled and saul recognises david as his successor.
a similar passage occurs in 1 samuel 26, when david is able to infiltrate saul's camp on the hill of hachilah and remove his spear and a jug of water from his side while he and his guards lie asleep.
in this account, david is advised by abishai that this is his opportunity to kill saul, but david declines, saying he will not "stretch out [his] hand against the lord's anointed".
saul confesses that he has been wrong to pursue david and blesses him.
in 1 samuel 27:1–4, saul ceases to pursue david because david took refuge a second time with achish, the philistine king of gath.
achish permits david to reside in ziklag, close to the border between gath and judea, from where he leads raids against the geshurites, the girzites and the amalekites, but leads achish to believe he is attacking the israelites in judah, the jerahmeelites and the kenites.
achish believes that david had become a loyal vassal, but he never wins the trust of the princes or lords of gath, and at their request achish instructs david to remain behind to guard the camp when the philistines march against saul.
david returns to ziklag.
jonathan and saul are killed in battle, and david is anointed king over judah.
in the north, saul's son ish-bosheth is anointed king of israel, and war ensues until ish-bosheth is murdered.
with the death of saul's son, the elders of israel come to hebron and david is anointed king over all of israel.
he conquers jerusalem, previously a jebusite stronghold, and makes it his capital.
he brings the ark of the covenant to the city, intending to build a temple for god, but the prophet nathan forbids it, prophesying that the temple would be built by one of david's sons.
nathan also prophesies that god has made a covenant with the house of david stating, "your throne shall be established forever".
david wins additional victories over the philistines, moabites, edomites, amalekites, ammonites and king hadadezer of aram-zobah, after which they become tributaries.
during a siege of the ammonite capital of rabbah, david remains in jerusalem.
he spies a woman, bathsheba, bathing and summons her; she becomes pregnant.
the text in the bible does not explicitly state whether bathsheba consented to sex.
david calls her husband, uriah the hittite, back from the battle to rest, hoping that he will go home to his wife and the child will be presumed to be his.
uriah does not visit his wife, however, so david conspires to have him killed in the heat of battle.
david then marries the widowed bathsheba.
in response, nathan prophesies the punishment that will fall upon him, stating "the sword shall never depart from your house."
when david acknowledges that he has sinned, nathan advises him that his sin is forgiven and he will not die, but the child will.in fulfillment of nathan's words, david's son absalom, fueled by vengeance and lust for power, rebels.
absalom's forces are routed at the battle of the wood of ephraim, and he is caught by his long hair in the branches of a tree where, contrary to david's order, he is killed by joab, the commander of david's army.
david laments the death of his favourite son: "o my son absalom, my son, my son absalom!
would i had died instead of you, o absalom, my son, my son!"
until joab persuades him to recover from "the extravagance of his grief" and to fulfill his duty to his people.
david returns to gilgal and is escorted across the river jordan and back to jerusalem by the tribes of judah and benjamin.
when david is old and bedridden, adonijah, his eldest surviving son and natural heir, declares himself king.
bathsheba and nathan go to david and obtain his agreement to crown bathsheba's son solomon as king, according to david's earlier promise, and the revolt of adonijah is put down.
david dies at the age of 70 after reigning for 40 years, and on his deathbed counsels solomon to walk in the ways of god and to take revenge on his enemies.
the book of samuel calls david a skillful harp (lyre) player and "the sweet psalmist of israel."
yet, while almost half of the psalms are headed "a psalm of david" (also translated as "to david" or "for david") and tradition identifies several with specific events in david's life (e.g., psalms 3, 7, 18, 34, 51, 52, 54, 56, 57, 59, 60, 63 and 142), the headings are late additions and no psalm can be attributed to david with certainty.
psalm 34 is attributed to david on the occasion of his escape from abimelech (or king achish) by pretending to be insane.
according to the parallel narrative in 1 samuel 21, instead of killing the man who had exacted so many casualties from him, abimelech allows david to depart, exclaiming, "am i so short of madmen that you have to bring this fellow here to carry on like this in front of me?
must this man come into my house?"
the tel dan stele, an inscribed stone erected by a king of damascus in the late 9th/early 8th centuries bce to commemorate his victory over two enemy kings, contains the phrase hebrew: ביתדוד‎, bytdwd, which most scholars translate as "house of david".
other scholars, such as anson rainey have challenged this reading, but it is likely that this is a reference to a dynasty of the kingdom of judah which traced its ancestry to a founder named david.
the mesha stele from moab, dating from approximately the same period, may also contain the name david in two places, although this is less certain than the mention in the tel dan inscription.
besides the two steles, bible scholar and egyptologist kenneth kitchen suggests that david's name also appears in a relief of pharaoh shoshenq (usually identified with shishak in the bible, 1 kings 14:25-27).
the relief claims that shoshenq raided places in palestine in 925 bce, and kitchen interprets one place as "heights of david", which was in southern judah and the negev  where the bible says david took refuge from saul.
the relief is damaged and interpretation is uncertain.
apart from these, all that is known of david comes from the biblical literature.
some scholars have concluded that this was likely compiled from contemporary records of the 11th and 10th centuries bce, but that there is no clear historical basis for determining the exact date of compilation.
other scholars, such as a. graeme auld, professor of hebrew bible at the university of edinburgh, believe that the books of samuel were substantially composed during the time of king josiah at the end of the 7th century bce, extended during the babylonian exile (6th century bce), and substantially complete by about 550 bce.
auld contends that further editing was done even after then—the silver quarter-shekel which saul's servant offers to samuel in 1 samuel 9 "almost certainly fixes the date of the story in the persian or hellenistic period" because a quarter-shekel was known to exist in hasmonean times.
the authors and editors of samuel drew on many earlier sources, including, for their history of david, the "history of david's rise" (1 samuel 16:14–2 samuel 5:10), and the "succession narrative" (2 samuel 9–20 and 1 kings 1–2).
the book of chronicles, which tells the story from a different point of view, was probably composed in the period 350–300 bce, and uses samuel as its source.
the authors and editors of samuel and chronicles did not aim to record history, but to promote david's reign as inevitable and desirable, and for this reason there is little about david that is concrete and undisputed.
the archaeological evidence indicates that in the 10th century bce, the time of david, judah was sparsely inhabited and jerusalem was no more than a small village; over the following century it slowly evolved from a highland chiefdom to a kingdom, but always overshadowed by the older and more powerful kingdom of israel to the north.
the biblical evidence likewise indicates that david's judah was something less than a full-fledged monarchy: it often calls him negid, for example, meaning "prince" or "chief", rather than melek, meaning "king"; the biblical david sets up none of the complex bureaucracy that a kingdom needs (even his army is made up of volunteers), and his followers are largely related to him and from his small home-area around hebron.
beyond this, the full range of possible interpretations is available.
john bright, in his history of israel (1981), takes samuel at face value.
donald b. redford, however, sees all reconstructions from biblical sources for the united monarchy period as examples of "academic wishful thinking".
thomas l. thompson rejects the historicity of the biblical narrative: "the history of palestine and of its peoples is very different from the bible's narratives, whatever political claims to the contrary may be.
an independent history of judea during the iron i and iron ii periods has little room for historicizing readings of the stories of i-ii samuel and i kings."
amihai mazar however, concludes that based on recent archeological findings, like those in city of david, khirbet qeiyafa, tel dan, tel rehov, khirbat en-nahas and others "the deconstruction of united monarchy and the devaluation of judah as a state in 9th century is unacceptable interpretation of available historic data".
according to mazar, based on archeological evidences, the united monarchy can be described as a "state in development".
some studies of david have been written: baruch halpern has pictured david as a lifelong vassal of achish, the philistine king of gath; israel finkelstein and neil asher silberman have identified as the oldest and most reliable section of samuel those chapters which describe david as the charismatic leader of a band of outlaws who captures jerusalem and makes it his capital.
steven mckenzie, associate professor of the hebrew bible at rhodes college and author of king david: a biography, argues that david came from a wealthy family, was "ambitious and ruthless" and a tyrant who murdered his opponents, including his own sons.
critical bible scholarship holds that the biblical account of david's rise to power is a political apology—an answer to contemporary charges against him, of his involvement in murders and regicide.
israel finkelstein and neil asher silberman reject the idea that david ruled over a united monarchy, suggesting instead that he ruled only as a chieftain over the southern kingdom of judah, much smaller than the northern kingdom of israel at that time.
they posit that israel and judah were still polytheistic or henotheistic in the time of david and solomon, and that much later seventh-century redactors sought to portray a past golden age of a united, monotheistic monarchy in order to serve contemporary needs.
they note a lack of archeological evidence for david's military campaigns and a relative underdevelopment of jerusalem, the capital of judah, compared to a more developed and urbanized samaria, capital of israel.
jacob l. wright, associate professor of hebrew bible at emory university, has written that the most popular legends about david, including his killing of goliath, his affair with bathsheba, and his ruling of a united kingdom of israel rather than just judah, are the creation of those who lived generations after him, in particular those living in the late persian or hellenistic periods.
david is an important figure in rabbinic judaism, with many legends around him.
according to one tradition, david was raised as the son of his father jesse and spent his early years herding his father's sheep in the wilderness while his brothers were in school.
david's adultery with bathsheba is interpreted as an opportunity to demonstrate the power of repentance, and the talmud states that it was not adultery at all, quoting a jewish practice of divorce on the eve of battle.
furthermore, according to talmudic sources, the death of uriah was not to be considered murder, on the basis that uriah had committed a capital offense by refusing to obey a direct command from the king.
however, in tractate sanhedrin, david expressed remorse over his transgressions and sought forgiveness.
god ultimately forgave david and bathsheba but would not remove their sins from scripture.
in jewish legend, david's sin with bathsheba is the punishment for david's excessive self-consciousness who had besought god to lead him into temptation so that he might give proof of his constancy as abraham, isaac, and jacob (who successfully passed the test) whose names later were united with god's, while david eventually failed through the temptation of a woman.
according to midrashim, adam gave up 70 years of his life for the life of david.
also, according to the talmud yerushalmi, david was born and died on the jewish holiday of shavuot (feast of weeks).
his piety was said to be so great that his prayers could bring down things from heaven.

the concept of the messiah is important in christianity.
originally an earthly king ruling by divine appointment ("the anointed one", as the title messiah had it), the "son of david" became in the last two pre-christian centuries the apocalyptic and heavenly one who would deliver israel and usher in a new kingdom.
this was the background to the concept of messiahship in early christianity, which interpreted the career of jesus "by means of the titles and functions assigned to david in the mysticism of the zion cult, in which he served as priest-king and in which he was the mediator between god and man".
the early church believed that "the life of david [foreshadowed] the life of christ; bethlehem is the birthplace of both; the shepherd life of david points out christ, the good shepherd; the five stones chosen to slay goliath are typical of the five wounds; the betrayal by his trusted counsellor, achitophel, and the passage over the cedron remind us of christ's sacred passion.
many of the davidic psalms, as we learn from the new testament, are clearly typical of the future messiah."
in the middle ages, "charlemagne thought of himself, and was viewed by his court scholars, as a 'new david'.
[this was] not in itself a new idea, but [one whose] content and significance were greatly enlarged by him".
the linking of david to earthly kingship was reflected in european cathedral windows of the late middle ages, through the device of the tree of jesse, its branches demonstrating how divine kingship descended from jesse, through his son david, to jesus.

western rite churches (lutheran, roman catholic) celebrate his feast day on 29 december, eastern-rite on 19 december.
the eastern orthodox church and eastern catholic churches celebrate the feast day of the "holy righteous prophet and king david" on the sunday of the holy forefathers (two sundays before the great feast of the nativity of the lord), when he is commemorated together with other ancestors of jesus.
he is also commemorated on the sunday after the nativity, together with joseph and james, the brother of the lord.

in european christian culture of the middle ages, david was made a member of the nine worthies, a group of heroes encapsulating all the ideal qualities of chivalry.
his life was thus proposed as a valuable subject for study by those aspiring to chivalric status.
this aspect of david in the nine worthies was popularised firstly through literature, and was thereafter adopted as a frequent subject for painters and sculptors.
david was considered as a model ruler and a symbol of divinely-ordained monarchy throughout medieval western europe and eastern christendom.
david was perceived as the biblical predecessor to christian roman and byzantine emperors and the name "new david" was used as an honorific reference to these rulers.
the georgian bagratids and the solomonic dynasty of ethiopia claimed a direct biological descent from him.
likewise, kings of the frankish carolingian dynasty frequently connected themselves to david; charlemagne himself occasionally used the name of david as his pseudonym.
david is an important figure in islam as one of the major prophets sent by god to guide the israelites.
david is mentioned several times in the quran with the arabic name داود, dāwūd, often with his son solomon.
in the qur'an: david killed goliath (2:251), a giant soldier in the philistine army.
when david killed goliath, god granted him kingship and wisdom and enforced it (38:20).
david was made god's "vicegerent on earth" (38:26) and god further gave david sound judgment (21:78; 37:21–24, 26) as well as the psalms, regarded as books of divine wisdom (4:163; 17:55).
the birds and mountains united with david in uttering praise to god (21:79; 34:10; 38:18), while god made iron soft for david (34:10), god also instructed david in the art of fashioning chain-mail out of iron (21:80); an indication of the first use of wrought iron, this knowledge gave david a major advantage over his bronze and cast iron-armed opponents, not to mention the cultural and economic impact.
together with solomon, david gave judgment in a case of damage to the fields (21:78) and david judged the matter between two disputants in his prayer chamber (38:21–23).
since there is no mention in the qur'an of the wrong david did to uriah nor any reference to bathsheba, muslims reject this narrative.
muslim tradition and the hadith stress david's zeal in daily prayer as well as in fasting.
qur'an commentators, historians and compilers of the numerous stories of the prophets elaborate upon david's concise qur'anic narratives and specifically mention david's gift in singing his psalms as well as his musical and vocal talents.
his voice is described as having had a captivating power, weaving its influence not only over man but over all beasts and nature, who would unite with him to praise god.
literary works about david include:
david has been depicted several times in films; these are some of the best-known:
for a considerable period, starting in the 15th century and continuing until the 19th, french playing card manufacturers assigned to each of the court cards names taken from history or mythology.
in this context, the king of spades was often known as "david".

"família" is the seventh single by brazilian rock band titãs, released in 1987. the song is about the everyday issues of a family.
it was once covered by molejo on their 1998 album família.
the song was featured on the rede manchete telenovela "corpo santo".
in 2013, bass player and vocalist nando reis (now an ex-member) recorded a new version of the song with his sons théo and sebastião.
the new version is being used as the opening theme of the 2013 season of rede globo's malhação.
while sebastião played acoustic guitar, nando reis and théo sang, sharing the same microphone, like the beatles used to do, "in order to create a more familiar atmosphere", according to reis.
nostalgia is a sentimentality for the past, typically for a period or place with happy personal associations.
the word nostalgia is learned formation of a greek compound, consisting of νόστος (nóstos), meaning "homecoming", a homeric word, and ἄλγος (álgos), meaning "pain" or "ache", and was coined by a 17th-century medical student to describe the anxieties displayed by swiss mercenaries fighting away from home.
described as a medical condition—a form of melancholy—in the early modern period, it became an important trope in romanticism.
nostalgia is associated with a yearning for the past, its personalities, possibilities, and events, especially the "good old days" or a "warm childhood".
the scientific literature on nostalgia usually refers to nostalgia regarding the personal life and has mainly studied the effects of nostalgia induced during the studies.
smell and touch are strong evokers of nostalgia due to the processing of these stimuli first passing through the amygdala, the emotional seat of the brain.
these recollections of one's past are usually important events, people one cares about, and places where one has spent time.
music and weather can also be strong triggers of nostalgia.
nostalgia's definition has changed greatly over time.
consistent with its greek word roots meaning "homecoming" and "pain," nostalgia was for centuries considered a potentially debilitating and sometimes fatal medical condition expressing extreme homesickness.
the modern view is that nostalgia is an independent, and even positive, emotion that many people experience often.
occasional nostalgia has been found to have many functions, such as to improve mood, increase social connectedness, enhance positive self-regard, and provide existential meaning.
many nostalgic reflections serve more than one function, and overall seem to benefit those who experience them.
such benefits may lead to a chronic disposition or personality trait of "nostalgia proneness."
nostalgia has also been associated with learning and memory consolidation.
although nostalgia is often triggered by negative feelings, it results in increasing one's mood and heightening positive emotions, which can stem from feelings of warmth or coping resulting from nostalgic reflections.
one way to improve mood is to effectively cope with problems that hinder one's happiness.
batcho (2013) found that nostalgia proneness positively related to successful methods of coping throughout all stages—planning and implementing strategies, and reframing the issue positively.
these studies led to the conclusion that the coping strategies that are likely among nostalgia prone people often lead to benefits during stressful times.
nostalgia can be connected to more focus on coping strategies and implementing them, thus increasing support in challenging times.
nostalgia also sometimes involves memories of people you were close to, and thus it can increase one's sense of social support and connections.
nostalgia is also triggered specifically by feelings of loneliness, but counteracts such feelings with reflections of close relationships.
according to zhou et al.
(2008), lonely people often have lesser perceptions of social support.
loneliness, however, leads to nostalgia, which actually increases perceptions of social support.
thus, zhou and colleagues (2008) concluded that nostalgia serves a restorative function for individuals regarding their social connectedness.
nostalgia serves as a coping mechanism and helps people to feel better about themselves.
vess et al.
(2012) found that the subjects who thought of nostalgic memories showed a greater accessibility of positive characteristics than those who thought of exciting future experiences.
additionally, in a second study conducted, some participants were exposed to nostalgic engagement and reflection while the other group was not.
the researchers looked again at self-attributes and found that the participants who were not exposed to nostalgic experiences reflected a pattern of selfish and self-centered attributes.
vess et al.
(2012), however, found that this effect had weakened and become less powerful among the participants who engaged in nostalgic reflection.
nostalgia helps increase one's self-esteem and meaning in life by buffering threats to well-being and also by initiating a desire to deal with problems or stress.
routledge (2011) and colleagues found that nostalgia correlates positively with one's sense of meaning in life.
the second study revealed that nostalgia increases one's perceived meaning in life, which was thought to be mediated by a sense of social support or connectedness.
thirdly, the researchers found that threatened meaning can even act as a trigger for nostalgia, thus increasing one's nostalgic reflections.
by triggering nostalgia, though, one's defensiveness to such threat is minimized as found in the fourth study.
the final two studies found that nostalgia is able to not only create meaning, but buffer threats to meaning by breaking the connection between a lack of meaning and one's well being.
follow-up studies also completed by routledge in 2012 not only found meaning as a function of nostalgia, but also concluded that nostalgic people have greater perceived meaning, search for meaning less, and can better buffer existential threat.
nostalgia makes people more willing to engage in growth-oriented behaviors and encourages them to view themselves as growth-oriented people.
baldwin & landau (2014) found that nostalgia leads people to rate themselves higher on items like "i am the kind of person who embraces unfamiliar people, events, and places."
nostalgia also increased interest in growth-related behavior such as "i would like to explore someplace that i have never been before."
in the first study, these effects were statistically mediated by nostalgia-induced positive affect—the extent to which nostalgia made participants feel good.
in the second study, nostalgia led to the same growth outcomes but the effects were statistically mediated by nostalgia-induced self-esteem.
one recent study critiques the idea of nostalgia, which in some forms can become a defense mechanism by which people avoid the historical facts.
this study looked at the different portrayals of apartheid in south africa and argued that nostalgia appears as two ways, 'restorative nostalgia' a wish to return to that past, and 'reflective nostalgia' which is more critically aware.
reliving past memories may provide comfort and contribute to mental health.
one notable recent medical study has looked at the physiological effects thinking about past 'good' memories can have.
they found that thinking about the past 'fondly' actually increased perceptions of physical warmth.
in a 2014 study conducted by routledge, he and a team observed that the more people reported having major disruptions and uncertainties in their lives, the more they nostalgically longed for the past.
routledge suggests that by invoking the idea of an idealized past, politicians can provoke the social and cultural anxieties and uncertainties that make nostalgia especially attractive — and effective — as a tool of political persuasion.
the term was coined in 1688 by johannes hofer (1669–1752) in his basel dissertation.
hofer introduced nostalgia or mal du pays "homesickness" for the condition also known as mal du suisse "swiss illness" or schweizerheimweh "swiss homesickness", because of its frequent occurrence in swiss mercenaries who in the plains of lowlands france or italy were pining for their native mountain landscapes.
symptoms were also thought to include fainting, high fever, indigestion, stomach pain, and death.
military physicians hypothesized that the malady was due to damage to the victims' brain cells and ear drums by the constant clanging of cowbells in the pastures of switzerland.
english homesickness is a loan translation of nostalgia.
sir joseph banks used the word in his journal during the first voyage of captain cook.
on 3 september 1770 he stated that the sailors "were now pretty far gone with the longing for home which the physicians have gone so far as to esteem a disease under the name of nostalgia", but his journal was not published in his lifetime (see beaglehole, j. c.
(ed.).
the endeavour journal of joseph banks 1768–1771, public library of new south wales/angus and robertson, sydney, 1962, vol.
ii, p. 145).
cases resulting in death were known and soldiers were sometimes successfully treated by being discharged and sent home.
receiving a diagnosis was, however, generally regarded as an insult.
in 1787 robert hamilton (1749–1830, physician of ipswich) described a case of a soldier suffering from nostalgia, who received sensitive and successful treatment:
[citation needed]
in the eighteenth century, scientists were looking for a locus of nostalgia, a nostalgic bone.
by the 1850s nostalgia was losing its status as a particular disease and coming to be seen rather as a symptom or stage of a pathological process.
it was considered as a form of melancholia and a predisposing condition among suicides.
nostalgia was, however, still diagnosed among soldiers as late as the american civil war.
by the 1870s interest in nostalgia as a medical category had almost completely vanished.
nostalgia was still being recognized in both the first and second world wars, especially by the american armed forces.
great lengths were taken to study and understand the condition to stem the tide of troops leaving the front in droves (see the bbc documentary century of the self).
nostalgia is triggered by something reminding an individual of an event or item from their past.
the resulting emotion can vary from happiness to sorrow.
the term of "feeling nostalgic" is more commonly used to describe pleasurable emotions associated with and/or a longing to go back to a particular period of time, although the former may also be true.
swiss nostalgia was linked to the singing of kuhreihen, which were forbidden to swiss mercenaries because they led to nostalgia to the point of desertion, illness or death.
the 1767 dictionnaire de musique by jean-jacques rousseau claims that swiss mercenaries were threatened with severe punishment to prevent them from singing their swiss songs.
it became somewhat of a topos in romantic literature, and figures in the poem der schweizer by achim von arnim (1805) and in clemens brentano's des knaben wunderhorn (1809) as well as in the opera le chalet by adolphe charles adam (1834) which was performed for queen victoria under the title the swiss cottage.
the romantic connection of nostalgia, the kuhreihen and the swiss alps was a significant factor in the enthusiasm for switzerland, the development of early tourism in switzerland and alpinism that took hold of the european cultural elite in the 19th century.
german romanticism coined an opposite to heimweh, fernweh "far-sickness," "longing to be far away," like wanderlust expressing the romantic desire to travel and explore.
hearing an old song can bring back memories for a person.
a song heard once at a specific moment and then not heard again until a far later date will give the listener a sense of nostalgia for the date remembered and events which occurred then.
however, if it is heard throughout life, it may lose its association with any specific period or experience.
a person can deliberately trigger feelings of nostalgia by listening to familiar music, looking at old photos, or visiting comforting environments of the past.
with this knowledge widely available, many books have been published specifically to evoke the feeling of nostalgia.
books are just one of many mediums used in the monetization of nostalgia[circular reference].
in media and advertising, nostalgia-evoking images, sounds, and references can be used strategically to create a sense of connectedness between consumers and products with the goal of convincing the public to consume, watch, or buy advertised products.
modern technology facilitates nostalgia-eliciting advertising through the subject, style, and design of an advertisement.
the feeling of longing for the past is easily communicated through social media and advertising because these media require the participation of multiple senses, are able to represent their ideas entirely, and therefore become more reminiscent of reality.
due to efficient advertising schemes, consumers need not have experienced a specific event or moment in time in order to feel nostalgic for it.
this is due to a phenomenon referred to as vicarious nostalgia.
vicarious nostalgia is a feeling of wistful yearning for a moment that occurred prior to, or outside of, the span of one's memory, but is relatable (has sentimental value) due to repeated mediated exposure to it.
the constant propagating of advertisements and other media messages makes vicarious nostalgia possible, and changes the ways we understand advertisements and subsequently, the way consumers use their purchasing power.
examples of nostalgia used to provoke public interest include nostalgia-themed websites including the nostalgia machine and doyouremember?, revamps of old movies, tv shows, and books.
vintage, rustic and old-fashioned design styles can also be seen in nostalgia-based ad campaigns that companies such as coca-cola and levi strauss & co. use.

joaquim josé da silva xavier (portuguese pronunciation: [ʒwaˈkĩ ʒuˈzɛ dɐ ˈsiwvɐ ʃɐviˈɛʁ]; november 12, 1746 – april 21, 1792), known as tiradentes (pronounced [tʃiɾɐˈdẽtʃis]), was a leading member of the brazilian revolutionary movement known as inconfidência mineira, whose aim was full independence from portuguese colonial power and creation of a brazilian republic.
when the separatists' plot was uncovered by authorities, tiradentes was arrested, tried and publicly hanged.
since the advent of the brazilian republic, tiradentes has been considered a national hero of brazil and patron of the military police.
tiradentes was born on the fazenda do pombal, near the village of santa rita do rio abaixo, at the time disputed territory between the towns of são joão del-rei and são josé del rey, in the captaincy of minas gerais.
joaquim josé da silva xavier was the fourth of seven children of portuguese born domingos da silva santos and of brazilian born antônia da encarnação xavier.
although by no means an aristocrat, tiradantes did not come from a poor family as evidenced by his mother's inventory, which was opened in 1756. it states that there were 35 slaves on the large fazenda of pombal, where they also worked as miners.
a porch provided external access to an oratory, and there were slave quarters and communal kitchens.
a large and valuable quantity of mining equipment was also listed in the inventory.
in 1755 after the death of his mother, he went with his father and brothers to the town of são josé.
two years later, when he was 11 years old, his father died.
with the premature death of his parents, his family soon lost its property due to debt.
having received no regular education, he entered under the tutelage of his uncle and godfather sebastião ferreira leitão, who was a dentist.
he worked as a peddler and a miner, and he became a partner in a pharmacy in vila rica.
he dedicated himself to pharmaceutical practices and dentistry, which earned him the nickname tiradentes.
"tiradentes" means "tooth puller", a pejorative denomination adopted during the trial against him.
according to brother raimundo de penaforte, tiradentes "adorned his mouth with new teeth which he made himself that seemed natural".
he also occasionally worked as a doctor in light of knowledge about medicinal plants acquired with his cousin, brother josé mariano da conceição veloso, a celebrated botanist of the time.
tiradentes used knowledge he acquired about minerals while working as a miner to enter the public service as a terrain surveyor.
he later joined the minas gerais dragoon regiment, where he was given command of a detachment and sent on missions to cities along "caminho novo", a road between vila rica (then capital of minas gerais) and rio de janeiro through which gold was sent to the coast, ultimately to be shipped to portugal.
over time, witnessing the transit of goods along caminho novo, tiradentes started to perceive the massive exportation of gold and other valuable resources to the metropolis as exploitation to which brazilians were subjected.
he also grew dissatisfied with his relatively low rank (not a member of the local aristocracy, he was systematically overlooked for promotion and never rose above alferes, the lowest officer rank at the time) and a later dismissal from his commanding post.
his trips to rio put him in contact with people who had lived in europe and brought liberal ideas from there.
in 1788, tiradentes met josé alvares maciel, a son of vila rica's army's commandant who had just returned from england.
contrasting british industrial progress with brazilian colonial poverty, the two decided to create a group of freedom aspirants.
led by clerics and other brazilians with some social presence, like cláudio manuel da costa, tomás antônio gonzaga (both public servants and renowned writers) and alvarenga peixoto (eminent businessman), the group propagated their ideas among the people.
at the time, portugal's demand for gold was high.
however, productivity of brazilian mines was declining.
the colony was failing to meet the quinto – the quota of gold demanded by the crown – and pressure from the metropolis rose.
this culminated in the creation of the derrama, a heavily confiscatory tribute that, in turn, further stirred seditious sentiments.
influenced by the writings of jean-jacques rousseau and the american revolution, tiradentes joined a number of like-minded citizens in the inconfidência mineira, a revolutionary movement.
they envisioned an independent brazilian republic, with são joão del rei as its capital and the conversion of vila rica to a university town.
the proposed flag for the new republic had a green triangle over a white background, surrounded by the latin motto "libertas quae sera tamen" ("freedom, even if it be late").
tiradentes's plan was to take to the streets of vila rica and proclaim a brazilian republic on the day of the derrama, in february 1789, when tax was due to portugal and the sentiment of revolt among brazilians would be stronger.
joaquim silvério dos reis, one of the conspirators, exposed the plot in exchange for a tax waiver.
the governor of minas gerais cancelled the derrama and ordered the imprisonment of the rebels.
a trial was carried, lasting almost three years.
tiradentes was sentenced to death, along with ten other inconfidentes.
queen maria i of portugal later commuted the sentences of capital punishment to perpetual banishment for all convicts, except those whose activities involved aggravated circumstances.
such was the case of tiradentes, who took full responsibility for the movement.
he was imprisoned in rio, then hanged on april 21, 1792. afterwards, his body was quartered and the pieces were sent to vila rica, to be displayed in places where he used to propagate his liberal ideas.
tiradentes began to be considered a national hero by the republicans in the late 19th century.
after the institution of the republic, in 1889, the anniversary of his death became a national holiday.
his moniker, "tiradentes", became the namesake of a city in the state of minas gerais, of city squares in belo horizonte, curitiba, são paulo, rio de janeiro, and ouro preto, as well as of a major avenue in santo domingo, dominican republic.

salvador guillermo allende gossens (us: /ɑːˈjɛndeɪ, -di/, uk: /æˈ-, aɪˈɛn-/, american spanish: [salβaˈðoɾ ɣiˈʝeɾmo aˈʝende ˈɣosens]; 26 june 1908 – 11 september 1973) was a chilean socialist politician and physician, president of chile from 1970 until 1973, and head of the popular unity political coalition government; he was latin america's first ever marxist to be elected president in a country with liberal democracy.
allende's involvement in chilean political life spanned a period of nearly forty years, having covered the posts of senator, deputy and cabinet minister.
as a life-long committed member of the socialist party of chile, whose foundation he had actively contributed to, he unsuccessfully ran for the national presidency in the 1952, 1958, and 1964 elections.
in 1970, he won the presidency in a close three-way race.
he was elected in a run-off by congress as no candidate had gained a majority.
on 11 september 1973, the military moved to oust allende in a coup d'état supported by the united states central intelligence agency (cia).
as troops surrounded la moneda palace, he gave his last speech vowing not to resign.
later that day, allende committed suicide with an ak-47 rifle gifted to him by fidel castro, according to an investigation conducted by a chilean court with the assistance of international experts in 2011.
following allende's death, general augusto pinochet refused to return authority to a civilian government, and chile was later ruled by a military junta that was in power up until 1990, ending more than four decades of uninterrupted democratic governance.
the military junta that took over dissolved the congress of chile, suspended the constitution, and began a persecution of alleged dissidents, in which at least 3,095 civilians disappeared or were killed.
allende was born on 26 june 1908 in valparaíso.
he was the son of salvador allende castro and laura gossens uribe.
allende's family belonged to the chilean upper middle class and had a long tradition of political involvement in progressive and liberal causes.
his grandfather was a prominent physician and a social reformist who founded one of the first secular schools in chile.
salvador allende was of basque and belgian (walloons) descent.
allende attended high school at instituto nacional general josé miguel carrera of santiago and at the liceo eduardo de la barra in valparaíso.
as a teenager, his main intellectual and political influence came from the shoe-maker juan de marchi, an italian-born anarchist.
allende was a talented athlete in his youth, being a member of the everton de viña del mar sports club (named after the more famous english football club of the same name), where he is said to have excelled at the long jump.
allende then graduated with a medical degree in 1933 from the university of chile.
during his time at medical school allende was influenced by professor max westenhofer, a german pathologist who emphasized the social determinants of disease and social medicine.
allende co-founded a section of the socialist party of chile (founded in 1933 with marmaduque grove and others) in valparaíso and became its chairman.
he married hortensia bussi with whom he had three daughters.
he was a freemason, a member of the lodge progreso no.
4 in valparaíso.
in 1933, he published his doctoral thesis higiene mental y delincuencia (crime and mental hygiene) in which he criticized cesare lombroso's proposals.
in 1938, allende was in charge of the electoral campaign of the popular front headed by pedro aguirre cerda.
the popular front's slogan was "bread, a roof and work!"
after its electoral victory, he became minister of health in the reformist popular front government which was dominated by the radicals.
while serving in this position, allende was responsible for the passage of a wide range of progressive social reforms, including safety laws protecting workers in the factories, higher pensions for widows, maternity care, and free lunch programmes for schoolchildren.
upon entering the government, allende relinquished his congressional seat for valparaíso, which he had won in 1937. around that time, he wrote la realidad médico social de chile (the social and medical reality of chile).
after the kristallnacht in nazi germany, allende was one of 76 members of the congress who sent a telegram to adolf hitler denouncing the persecution of jews.
following president aguirre cerda's death in 1941, he was again elected deputy while the popular front was renamed democratic alliance.
in 1945, allende became senator for the valdivia, llanquihue, chiloé, aisén and magallanes provinces; then for tarapacá and antofagasta in 1953; for aconcagua and valparaíso in 1961; and once more for chiloé, aisén and magallanes in 1969. he became president of the chilean senate in 1966. during the fifties, allende introduced legislation that established the chilean national health service, the first program in the americas to guarantee universal health care.
his three unsuccessful bids for the presidency (in the 1952, 1958 and 1964 elections) prompted allende to joke that his epitaph would be "here lies the next president of chile."
in 1952, as candidate for the frente de acción popular (popular action front, frap), he obtained only 5.4% of the votes, partly due to a division within socialist ranks over support for carlos ibáñez.
in 1958, again as the frap candidate, allende obtained 28.5% of the vote.
this time, his defeat was attributed to votes lost to the populist antonio zamorano.
declassified documents show that from 1962 through 1964, the cia spent a total of $2.6 million to finance the campaign of eduardo frei and spent $3 million in anti-allende propaganda "to scare voters away from allende's frap coalition".
the cia considered its role in the victory of frei a great success.
they argued that "the financial and organizational assistance given to frei, the effort to keep durán in the race, the propaganda campaign to denigrate allende—were 'indispensable ingredients of frei's success'", and they thought that his chances of winning and the good progress of his campaign would have been doubtful without the covert support of the government of the united states.
thus, in 1964 allende lost once more as the frap candidate, polling 38.6% of the votes against 55.6% for christian democrat eduardo frei.
as it became clear that the election would be a race between allende and frei, the political right – which initially had backed radical julio durán– settled for frei as "the lesser evil".
allende had a close relationship with the chilean communist party from the beginning of his political career.
on his fourth (and successful) bid for the presidency, the communist party supported him as the alternate for its own candidate, the world-renowned poet pablo neruda.
during his presidential term, allende shared positions held by the communists, in opposition to the views of the socialists.
some argue, however, that this was reversed at the end of his period in office.
[a]
allende won the 1970 chilean presidential election as leader of the unidad popular ("popular unity") coalition.
on 4 september 1970, he obtained a narrow plurality of 36.2% to 34.9% over jorge alessandri, a former president, with 27.8% going to a third candidate (radomiro tomic) of the christian democratic party (pdc).
according to the chilean constitution of the time, if no presidential candidate obtained a majority of the popular vote, congress would choose one of the two candidates with the highest number of votes as the winner.
tradition was for congress to vote for the candidate with the highest popular vote, regardless of margin.
indeed, former president jorge alessandri had been elected in 1958 with only 31.6% of the popular vote, defeating allende.
one month after the election, on 20 october, while the senate had still to reach a decision and negotiations were actively in place between the christian democrats and the popular unity, general rené schneider, commander in chief of the chilean army, was shot resisting a kidnap attempt by a group led by general roberto viaux.
hospitalized, he died of his wounds three days later, on 23 october.
schneider was a defender of the "constitutionalist" doctrine that the army's role is exclusively professional, its mission being to protect the country's sovereignty and not to interfere in politics.
general schneider's death was widely disapproved of and, for the time, ended military opposition to allende, whom the congress finally chose on 24 october.
on 26 october, president eduardo frei named general carlos prats as commander in chief of the army to replace rené schneider.
allende assumed the presidency on 3 november 1970 after signing a statute of constitutional guarantees proposed by the christian democrats in return for their support in congress.
in an extensive interview with régis debray in 1972, allende explained his reasons for agreeing to the guarantees.
some critics have interpreted allende's responses as an admission that signing the statute was only a tactical move.
upon assuming the presidency, allende began to carry out his platform of implementing a socialist programme called la vía chilena al socialismo ("the chilean path to socialism").
this included nationalization of large-scale industries (notably copper mining and banking), and government administration of the health care system, educational system (with the help of a united states educator, jane a. hobson-gonzalez from kokomo, indiana), a programme of free milk for children in the schools and shanty towns of chile, and an expansion of the land seizure and redistribution already begun under his predecessor eduardo frei montalva, who had nationalized between one-fifth and one-quarter of all the properties listed for takeover.
allende also intended to improve the socio-economic welfare of chile's poorest citizens; a key element was to provide employment, either in the new nationalized enterprises or on public work projects.
in november 1970, 3,000 scholarships were allocated to mapuche children in an effort to integrate the indigenous minority into the educational system, payment of pensions and grants was resumed, an emergency plan providing for the construction of 120,000 residential buildings was launched, all part-time workers were granted rights to social security, a proposed electricity price increase was withdrawn, diplomatic relations were restored with cuba, and political prisoners were granted an amnesty.
in december that same year, bread prices were fixed, 55,000 volunteers were sent to the south of the country to teach writing and reading skills and provide medical attention to a sector of the population that had previously been ignored, a central commission was established to oversee a tri-partite payment plan in which equal place was given to government, employees and employers, and a protocol agreement was signed with the united centre of workers which granted workers representational rights on the funding board of the social planning ministry.
an obligatory minimum wage for workers of all ages (including apprentices) was established, free milk was introduced for expectant and nursing mothers and for  children between the ages of 7 and 14, free school meals were established, rent reductions were carried out, and the construction of the santiago subway was rescheduled so as to serve working-class neighbourhoods first.
workers benefited from increases in social security payments, an expanded public works program, and a modification of the wage and salary adjustment mechanism (which had originally been introduced in the 1940s to cope with the country's permanent inflation), while middle-class chileans benefited from the elimination of taxes on modest incomes and property.
in addition, state-sponsored programs distributed free food to the country's neediest citizens, and in the countryside, peasant councils were established to mobilise agrarian workers and small proprietors.
in the government's first budget (presented to the chilean congress in november 1970), the minimum taxable income level was raised, removing from the tax pool 35% of those who had paid taxes on earnings in the previous year.
in addition, the exemption from general taxation was raised to a level equivalent to twice the minimum wage.
exemptions from capital taxes were also extended, which benefitted 330,000 small proprietors.
the extra increases that frei promised to the armed forces were also fully paid.
according to one estimate, purchasing power went up by 28% between october 1970 and july 1971.
the rate of inflation fell from 36.1% in 1970 to 22.1% in 1971, while average real wages rose by 22.3% during 1971.
[b] minimum real wages for blue-collar workers were increased by 56% during the first quarter of 1971, while in the same period real minimum wages for white-collar workers were increased by 23%, a development that decreased the differential ratio between blue- and white-collar workers’ minimum wage from 49% (1970) to 35% (1971).
central government expenditures went up by 36% in real terms, raising the share of fiscal spending in gdp from 21% (1970) to 27% (1971), and as part of this expansion, the public sector engaged in a huge housing program, starting to build 76,000 houses in 1971, compared to 24,000 for 1970. during a 1971 emergency program, over 89,000 houses were built, and during allende's three years as president an average of 52,000 houses were constructed annually.
although the acceleration of inflation in 1972 and 1973 eroded part of the initial increase in wages, they still rose (on average) in real terms during the 1971–73 period.
allende's first step in early 1971 was to raise minimum wages (in real terms) for blue-collar workers by 37%–41% and 8%–10% for white-collar workers.
educational, food, and housing assistance was significantly expanded, with public-housing starts going up twelvefold and eligibility for free milk extended from age 6 to age 15. a year later, blue-collar wages were raised by 27% in real terms and white-collar wages became fully indexed.
price controls were also set up, while the allende government introduced a system of distribution networks through various agencies (including local committees on supply and prices) to ensure that the new rules were adhered to by shopkeepers.
the new minister of agriculture, jacques chonchol, promised to expropriate all estates which were larger than eighty "basic" hectares (about 200 acres).
this promise was kept, with no farm in chile exceeding this limit by the end of 1972. within eighteen months, the latifundia (extensive agricultural estates) had been abolished.
the agrarian reform had involved the expropriation of 3,479 properties which, added to the 1,408 properties incorporated under the frei government, made up some 40% of the total agricultural land area in the country.
particularly in rural areas, the allende government launched a campaign against illiteracy, while adult education programs expanded, together with educational opportunities for workers.
from 1971 through to 1973, enrollments in kindergarten, primary, secondary, and postsecondary schools all increased.
the allende government encouraged more doctors to begin their practices in rural and low-income urban areas, and built additional hospitals, maternity clinics, and especially neighborhood health centers that remained open longer hours to serve the poor.
improved sanitation and housing facilities for low-income neighborhoods also equalized health care benefits, while hospital councils and local health councils were established in neighborhood health centers as a means of democratizing the administration of health policies.
these councils gave central government civil servants, local government officials, health service employees, and community workers the right to review budgetary decisions.
the allende government also sought to bring the arts (both serious and popular) to the mass of the chilean population by funding a number of cultural endeavours.
with eighteen-year-olds and illiterates now granted the right to vote, mass participation in decision-making was encouraged by the allende government, with traditional hierarchical structures now challenged by socialist egalitarianism.
the allende government was able to draw upon the idealism of its supporters, with teams of "allendistas" travelling into the countryside and shanty towns to perform volunteer work.
the allende government also worked to transform chilean popular culture through formal changes to school curriculum and through broader cultural education initiatives, such as state-sponsored music festivals and tours of chilean folklorists and nueva canción musicians.
in 1971, the purchase of a private publishing house by the state gave rise to "editorial quimantu", which became the center of the allende government's cultural activities.
in the space of two years, 12 million copies of books, magazines, and documents (8 million of which were books) specializing in social analysis, were published.
cheap editions of great literary works were produced on a weekly basis, and in most cases were sold out within a day.
culture came into the reach of the masses for the first time, who responded enthusiastically.
"editorial quimantu" encouraged the establishment of libraries in community organizations and trade unions.
through the supply of cheap textbooks, it enabled the left to progress through the ideological content of the literature made available to workers.
to improve social and economic conditions for women, the women's secretariat was established in 1971, which took on issues such as public laundry facilities, public food programs, day-care centers, and women's health care (especially prenatal care).
the duration of maternity leave was extended from 6 to 12 weeks, while the allende government steered the educational system towards poorer chileans by expanding enrollments through government subsidies.
a "democratisation" of university education was carried out, making the system tuition-free.
this led to an 89% rise in university enrollments between 1970 and 1973. the allende government also increased enrollment in secondary education from 38% in 1970 to 51% in 1974. enrollment in education reached record levels, including 3.6 million young people, and 8 million school textbooks were distributed among 2.6 million pupils in primary education.
an unprecedented 130,000 students were enrolled by the universities, which became accessible to peasants and workers.
the illiteracy rate was reduced from 12% in 1970 to 10.8% in 1972, while the growth in primary school enrollment increased from an annual average of 3.4% in the period 1966–70 to 6.5% in 1971–1972.
secondary education grew at a rate of 18.2% in 1971–1972, and the average school enrollment of children between the ages of 6 and 14 rose from 91% (1966–70) to 99%.
social spending was dramatically increased, particularly for housing, education, and health, while a major effort was made to redistribute wealth to poorer chileans.
as a result of new initiatives in nutrition and health, together with higher wages, many poorer chileans were able to feed themselves and clothe themselves better than they had been able to before.
public access to the social security system was increased, while state benefits such as family allowances were raised significantly.
the redistribution of income enabled wage and salary earners to increase their share of national income from 51.6% (the annual average between 1965 and 1970) to 65% while family consumption increased by 12.9% in the first year of the allende government.
in addition, while the average annual increase in personal spending had been 4.8% in the period 1965–70, it reached 11.9% in 1971. during the first two years of allende's presidency, state expenditure on health rose from around 2% to nearly 3.5% of gdp.
according to jennifer e. pribble, this new spending "was reflected not only in public health campaigns, but also in the construction of health infrastructure".
small programs targeted at women were also experimented with, such as cooperative laundries and communal food preparation, together with an expansion of child-care facilities.
the national supplementary food program was extended to all primary school pupils and to all pregnant women, regardless of their employment or income condition.
complementary nutritional schemes were applied to malnourished children, while antenatal care was emphasized.
under allende, the proportion of children under the age of 6 with some form of malnutrition fell by 17%.
apart from the existing supply and prices councils (community-based bodies which controlled the distribution of essential groups in working-class districts, and were a popular, not government, initiative), community-based distribution centers and shops were developed, which sold directly in working-class neighborhoods.
the allende government felt obliged to increase its intervention in marketing activities, and state involvement in grocery distribution reached 33%.
the cut (central labor confederation) was accorded legal recognition, and its membership grew from 700,000 to almost 1 million.
in enterprises in the area of social ownership, an assembly of the workers elected half of the members of the management council for each company.
these bodies replaced the former board of directors.
minimum pensions were increased by amounts equal to two or three times the inflation rate, and between 1970 and 1972, such pensions increased by a total of 550%.
the incomes of 300,000 retirement pensioners were increased by the government from one-third of the minimum salary to the full amount.
labor insurance cover was extended to 200,000 market traders, 130,000 small shop proprietors, 30,000 small industrialists, small owners, transport workers, clergy, professional sportsmen, and artesans.
the public health service was improved, with the establishment of a system of clinics in working-class neighborhoods on the peripheries of the major cities, providing a health center for every 40,000 inhabitants.
statistics for construction in general, and house-building in particular, reached some of the highest levels in the history of chile.
four million square metres were completed in 1971–72, compared to an annual average of ​2 1⁄2 million between 1965 and 1970. workers were able to acquire goods which had previously been beyond their reach, such as heaters, refrigerators, and television sets.
as further noted by ricardo israel zipper,
"by now meat was no longer a luxury, and the children of working people were adequately supplied with shoes and clothing.
the popular living standards were improved in terms of the employment situation, social services, consumption levels, and income distribution."
chilean presidents were allowed a maximum term of six years, which may explain allende's haste to restructure the economy.
not only was a major restructuring program organized (the vuskovic plan), he had to make it a success if a socialist or communist successor to allende was going to be elected.
in the first year of allende's term, the short-term economic results of minister of the economy pedro vuskovic's expansive monetary policy were highly favorable: 12% industrial growth and an 8.6% increase in gdp, accompanied by major declines in inflation (down from 34.9% to 22.1%) and unemployment (down to 3.8%).
however, by 1972, the chilean escudo had an inflation rate of 140%.
the average real gdp contracted between 1971 and 1973 at an annual rate of 5.6% ("negative growth"); and the government's fiscal deficit soared while foreign reserves declined.
the combination of inflation and government-mandated price-fixing, together with the "disappearance" of basic commodities from supermarket shelves, led to the rise of black markets in rice, beans, sugar, and flour.
the chilean economic situation was also somewhat exacerbated due to a us-backed campaign to fund worker strikes in certain sectors of the economy.
the allende government announced it would default on debts owed to international creditors and foreign governments.
allende also froze all prices while raising salaries.
his implementation of these policies was strongly opposed by landowners, employers, businessmen and transporters associations, and some civil servants and professional unions.
the rightist opposition was led by the national party, the roman catholic church (which in 1973 was displeased with the direction of educational policy), and eventually the christian democrats.
there were growing tensions with foreign multinational corporations and the government of the united states.
allende also undertook the pioneeristic project cybersyn, a distributed decision support system for decentralized economic planning, developed by british cybernetics expert stafford beer.
based on the experimental viable system model and the neural network approach to organizational design,  the project consisted of four modules: a network of telex machines (cybernet) in all state-run enterprises that would transmit and receive information with the government in santiago.
information from the field would be fed into statistical modeling software (cyberstride) that would monitor production indicators, such as raw material supplies or high rates of worker absenteeism, in "almost" real time, alerting the workers in the first case and, in abnormal situations, if those parameters fell outside acceptable ranges by a very large degree, also the central government.
the information would also be input into an economic simulation software (checo, for chilean economic simulator) which featured a bayesian filtering and control setting that the government could use to forecast the possible outcome of economic decisions.
finally, a sophisticated operations room (opsroom) would provide a space where managers could see relevant economic data, formulate feasible responses to emergencies, and transmit advice and directives to enterprises and factories in alarm situations by using the telex network.
in conjunction with the system, the cybersyn development team also planned the so-called cyberfolk device system, a closed television circuit connected to an interactive apparatus that would enable the citizenry to actively participate in economic and political decision-making.
in 1971, chile re-established diplomatic relations with cuba, joining mexico and canada in rejecting a previously established organization of american states convention prohibiting governments in the western hemisphere from establishing diplomatic relations with cuba.
shortly afterward, cuban president fidel castro made a month-long visit to chile.
originally the visit was supposed to be one week; however, castro enjoyed chile and one week led to another.
in october 1972, the first of what were to be a wave of strikes was led first by truckers, and later by small businessmen, some (mostly professional) unions and some student groups.
other than the inevitable damage to the economy, the chief effect of the 24-day strike was to induce allende to bring the head of the army, general carlos prats, into the government as interior minister.
allende also instructed the government to begin requisitioning trucks in order to keep the nation from coming to a halt.
government supporters also helped to mobilize trucks and buses but violence served as a deterrent to full mobilization, even with police protection for the strike-breakers.
allende's actions were eventually declared unlawful by the chilean appeals court and the government was ordered to return trucks to their owners.
throughout this presidency racial tensions between the poor descendants of indigenous people, who supported allende's reforms, and the white elite increased.
allende raised wages on a number of occasions throughout 1970 and 1971, but these wage hikes were negated by the in-tandem inflation of chile's fiat currency.
although price rises had also been high under frei (27% a year between 1967 and 1970), a basic basket of consumer goods rose by 120% from 190 to 421 escudos in one month alone, august 1972. in the period 1970–72, while allende was in government, exports fell 24% and imports rose 26%, with imports of food rising an estimated 149%.
export income fell due to a hard-hit copper industry: the price of copper on international markets fell by almost a third, and post-nationalization copper production fell as well.
copper is chile's single most important export (more than half of chile's export receipts were from this sole commodity).
the price of copper fell from a peak of $66 per ton in 1970 to only $48–9 in 1971 and 1972.  chile was already dependent on food imports, and this decline in export earnings coincided with declines in domestic food production following allende's agrarian reforms.
throughout his presidency, allende remained at odds with the chilean congress, which was dominated by the christian democratic party.
the christian democrats (who had campaigned on a socialist platform in the 1970 elections, but drifted away from those positions during allende's presidency, eventually forming a coalition with the national party)[citation needed], continued to accuse allende of leading chile toward a cuban-style dictatorship, and sought to overturn many of his more radical policies.
allende and his opponents in congress repeatedly accused each other of undermining the chilean constitution and acting undemocratically.
allende's increasingly bold socialist policies (partly in response to pressure from some of the more radical members within his coalition), combined with his close contacts with cuba, heightened fears in washington.
the nixon administration continued exerting economic pressure on chile via multilateral organizations, and continued to back allende's opponents in the chilean congress.
almost immediately after his election, nixon directed cia and u.s. state department officials to "put pressure" on the allende government.
his economic policies were used by economists rudi dornbusch and sebastian edwards to coin the term macroeconomic populism.
in 1972, chile's inflation was at 150%.
("pinochet's rule: repression and economic success".

allende's popular unity government tried to maintain normal relations with the united states.
but when chile nationalized its copper industry, washington cut off united states credits and increased its support to opposition.
forced to seek alternative sources of trade and finance, chile gained commitments from the soviet union to invest some $400 million in chile in the next six years.
[citation needed] allende's government was disappointed that it received far less economic assistance from the ussr than it hoped for.
trade between the two countries did not significantly increase and the credits were mainly linked to the purchase of soviet equipment.
moreover, credits from the soviet union were much less than those provided to the people's republic of china and countries of eastern europe.
when allende visited the ussr in late 1972 in search of more aid and additional lines of credit, after 3 years, he was turned down.
the united states opposition to allende started several years before he was elected president of chile.
declassified documents show that from 1962 through 1964, the cia spent $3 million in anti-allende propaganda "to scare voters away from allende's frap coalition", and spent a total of $2.6 million to finance the presidential campaign of eduardo frei.
the possibility of allende winning chile's 1970 election was deemed a disaster by a us administration that wanted to protect us geopolitical interests by preventing the spread of communism during the cold war.
in september 1970, president nixon informed the cia that an allende government in chile would not be acceptable and authorized $10 million to stop allende from coming to power or unseat him.
a cia document declared, "it is firm and continuing policy that allende be overthrown by a coup."
henry kissinger's 40 committee and the cia planned to impede allende's investiture as president of chile with covert efforts known as "track i" and "track ii"; track i sought to prevent allende from assuming power via so-called "parliamentary trickery", while under the track ii initiative, the cia tried to convince key chilean military officers to carry out a coup.
additionally, some point to the involvement of the defense intelligence agency agents that allegedly secured the missiles used to bombard la moneda palace.
in fact, open us military aid to chile continued during the allende administration, and the national government was very much aware of this, although there is no record that allende himself believed that such assistance was anything but beneficial to chile.
during nixon's presidency, united states officials attempted to prevent allende's election by financing political parties aligned with opposition candidate jorge alessandri and supporting strikes in the mining and transportation sectors.
after the 1970 election, the track i operation attempted to incite chile's outgoing president, eduardo frei montalva, to persuade his party (pdc) to vote in congress for alessandri.
under the plan, alessandri would resign his office immediately after assuming it and call new elections.
eduardo frei would then be constitutionally able to run again (since the chilean constitution did not allow a president to hold two consecutive terms, but allowed multiple non-consecutive ones), and presumably easily defeat allende.
the chilean congress instead chose allende as president, on the condition that he would sign a "statute of constitutional guarantees" affirming that he would respect and obey the chilean constitution and that his reforms would not undermine any of its elements.
track ii was aborted, as parallel initiatives already underway within the chilean military rendered it moot.
during the second term of office of democratic president bill clinton, the cia acknowledged having played a role in chilean politics before the coup, but its degree of involvement is debated.
the cia was notified by its chilean contacts of the impending coup two days in advance but contends it "played no direct role in" the coup.
much of the internal opposition to allende's policies came from the business sector, and recently released united states government documents confirm that the united states indirectly funded the truck drivers' strike, which exacerbated the already chaotic economic situation before the coup.
the most prominent united states corporations in chile before allende's presidency were the anaconda and kennecott copper companies and itt corporation, international telephone and telegraph.
both copper corporations aimed to expand privatized copper production in the city of sewell in the chilean andes, where the world's largest underground copper mine "el teniente", was located.
at the end of 1968, according to us department of commerce data, united states corporate holdings in chile amounted to $964 million.
anaconda and kennecott accounted for 28% of united states holdings, but itt had by far the largest holding of any single corporation, with an investment of $200 million in chile.
in 1970, before allende was elected, itt owned 70% of chitelco, the chilean telephone company and funded el mercurio, a chilean right-wing newspaper.
documents released in 2000 by the cia confirmed that before the elections of 1970, itt gave $700,000 to allende's conservative opponent, jorge alessandri, with help from the cia on how to channel the money safely.
itt president harold geneen also offered $1 million to the cia to help defeat allende in the elections.
after general pinochet assumed power, united states secretary of state henry kissinger told president richard nixon that the united states "didn't do it", but "we helped them...created the conditions as great as possible".
(referring to the coup itself).
recent documents declassified under the clinton administration's chile declassification project show that the united states government and the cia sought to overthrow allende in 1970 immediately before he took office ("project fubelt").
many documents regarding the united states intervention in chile remain classified.
political and moral support came mostly through the communist party and unions of the soviet union.
for instance, allende received the lenin peace prize from the soviet union in 1972. however, there were some fundamental differences between allende and soviet political analysts, who believed that some violence – or measures that those analysts "theoretically considered to be just" – should have been used.
declarations from kgb general nikolai leonov, former deputy chief of the first chief directorate of the kgb, confirmed that the soviet union supported allende's government economically, politically and militarily.
leonov stated in an interview at the chilean center of public studies (cep) that the soviet economic support included over $100 million in credit, three fishing ships (that distributed 17,000 tons of frozen fish to the population), factories (as help after the 1971 earthquake), 3,100 tractors, 74,000 tons of wheat and more than a million tins of condensed milk.
in mid-1973 the ussr had approved the delivery of weapons (artillery, tanks) to the chilean army.
however, when news of an attempt from the army to depose allende through a coup d'état reached soviet officials, the shipment was redirected to another country.
allende is mentioned in a book written by the official historian of the british intelligence mi5 christopher andrew.
according to sis and andrew, the book is based on the handwritten notes of kgb archivist defector vasili mitrokhin.
andrew alleges that the kgb said that allende "was made to understand the necessity of reorganizing chile's army and intelligence services, and of setting up a relationship between chile's and the ussr's intelligence services".
the soviet union observed closely whether this alternative form of socialism could work, and they did not interfere with the chileans' decisions.
nikolai leonov affirms that whenever he tried to give advice to latin american leaders he was usually turned down by them, and he was told that they had their own understanding on how to conduct political business in their countries.
leonov adds that the relationships of kgb agents with latin american leaders did not involve intelligence, because their intelligence target was the united states.
since many north americans were living in the region, they were focusing in recruiting agents from the united states.
latin america was also a better region for kgb agents to get in touch with their informants from the cia or other contacts from the united states than inside that country.
on 29 june 1973, colonel roberto souper surrounded the presidential palace, la moneda, with his tank regiment but failed to depose the government.
that failed coup d’état – known as the tanquetazo ("tank putsch") – organised by the nationalist patria y libertad paramilitary group, was followed by a general strike at the end of july that included the copper miners of el teniente.
[citation needed]
in august 1973, a constitutional crisis occurred, and the supreme court of chile publicly complained about the inability of the allende government to enforce the law of the land.
on 22 august, the chamber of deputies (with the christian democrats uniting with the national party) accused the government of unconstitutional acts through allende's refusal to promulgate constitutional amendments, already approved by the chamber, which would have prevented his government from continuing his massive nationalization plan and called upon the military to enforce constitutional order.
for months, allende had feared calling upon the carabineros ("carabineers", the national police force), suspecting them of disloyalty to his government.
on 9 august, president allende appointed general carlos prats as minister of defence.
on 24 august 1973, general prats was forced to resign both as defense minister and as the commander-in-chief of the army, embarrassed by both the alejandrina cox incident and a public protest in front of his house by the wives of his generals.
general augusto pinochet replaced him as army commander-in-chief the same day.
on 26 may 1973, the supreme court of chile unanimously denounced the allende government's disruption of the legality of the nation in its failure to uphold judicial decisions, because of its continual refusal to permit police execution of judicial decisions contrary to the government's own measures.
on 22 august 1973, the christian democrats and the national party members of the chamber of deputies joined together to vote 81 to 47 in favor of a resolution that asked the authorities to "put an immediate end" to "breach[es of] the constitution…with the goal of redirecting government activity toward the path of law and ensuring the constitutional order of our nation, and the essential underpinnings of democratic co-existence among chileans."
the resolution declared that allende's government sought "to conquer absolute power with the obvious purpose of subjecting all citizens to the strictest political and economic control by the state... [with] the goal of establishing... a totalitarian system" and claimed that the government had made "violations of the constitution... a permanent system of conduct."
essentially, most of the accusations were about disregard by the socialist government of the separation of powers, and arrogating legislative and judicial prerogatives to the executive branch of government.
specifically, the socialist government of president allende was accused of:
finally, the resolution condemned the creation and development of government-protected [socialist] armed groups, which were said to be "headed towards a confrontation with the armed forces".
president allende's efforts to re-organize the military and the police forces were characterized as "notorious attempts to use the armed and police forces for partisan ends, destroy their institutional hierarchy, and politically infiltrate their ranks".
two days later, on 24 august 1973, allende responded, characterising the congress's declaration as "destined to damage the country’s prestige abroad and create internal confusion", predicting "it will facilitate the seditious intention of certain sectors."
he noted that the declaration (passed 81–47 in the chamber of deputies) had not obtained the two-thirds senate majority "constitutionally required" to convict the president of abuse of power: essentially, the congress were "invoking the intervention of the armed forces and of order against a democratically-elected government" and "subordinat[ing] political representation of national sovereignty to the armed institutions, which neither can nor ought to assume either political functions or the representation of the popular will."
allende argued he had obeyed constitutional means for including military men to the cabinet at the service of civic peace and national security, defending republican institutions against insurrection and terrorism.
in contrast, he said that congress was promoting a coup d’état or a civil war with a declaration full of affirmations that had already been refuted beforehand and which, in substance and process (directly handing it to the ministers rather than directly handing it to the president) violated a dozen articles of the (then-current) constitution.
he further argued that the legislature was usurping the government's executive function.
allende wrote: "chilean democracy is a conquest by all of the people.
it is neither the work nor the gift of the exploiting classes, and it will be defended by those who, with sacrifices accumulated over generations, have imposed it...with a tranquil conscience...i sustain that never before has chile had a more democratic government than that over which i have the honor to preside...i solemnly reiterate my decision to develop democracy and a state of law to their ultimate consequences...congress has made itself a bastion against the transformations...and has done everything it can to perturb the functioning of the finances and of the institutions, sterilizing all creative initiatives."
adding that economic and political means would be needed to relieve the country's current crisis, and that the congress were obstructing said means; having already paralyzed the state, they sought to destroy it.
he concluded by calling upon the workers, all democrats and patriots to join him in defending the chilean constitution and the revolutionary process.
in early september 1973, allende floated the idea of resolving the constitutional crisis with a plebiscite[c].
his speech outlining such a solution was scheduled for 11 september, but he was never able to deliver it.
on 11 september 1973, the chilean military, aided by the united states and its cia, staged a coup against allende.
just before the capture of la moneda (the presidential palace), with gunfire and explosions clearly audible in the background, allende gave his farewell speech to chileans on live radio, speaking of himself in the past tense, of his love for chile and of his deep faith in its future.
he stated that his commitment to chile did not allow him to take an easy way out, and he would not be used as a propaganda tool by those he called "traitors" (he refused an offer of safe passage), clearly implying he intended to fight to the end.
shortly afterwards, the coup plotters announced that allende had committed suicide.
an official announcement declared that the weapon he had used was an automatic rifle.
before his death he had been photographed several times holding an ak-47, a gift from fidel castro.
he was found dead with this gun, according to contemporaneous statements made by officials in the pinochet regime.
lingering doubts regarding the manner of allende's death persisted throughout the period of the pinochet regime.
many chileans and independent observers refused to accept on faith the government's version of events amid speculation that allende had been murdered by government agents.
when in 2011 a chilean court opened a criminal investigation into the circumstances of allende's death, pinochet had long since left power and chile had meanwhile become one of the most stable democracies in the americas according to the economist magazine's democracy index.
the ongoing criminal investigation led to a may 2011 court order that allende's remains be exhumed and autopsied by an international team of experts.
results of the autopsy were officially released in mid-july 2011. the team of experts concluded that the former president had shot himself with an ak-47 assault rifle.
in december 2011 the judge in charge of the investigation affirmed the experts' findings and ruled allende's death a suicide.
on 11 september 2012, the 39th anniversary of allende's death, a chilean appeals court unanimously upheld the trial court's ruling, officially closing the case.
the guardian, a leading uk newspaper, reported that a scientific autopsy of the remains had confirmed that "salvador allende committed suicide during the 1973 coup that toppled his socialist government."
the guardian went on to say that:
british ballistics expert david prayer said allende died of two shots fired from an assault rifle that was held between his legs and under his chin and was set to fire automatically.
the bullets blew out the top of his head and killed him instantly.
the forensics team's conclusion was unanimous.
spanish expert francisco etxeberria said: "we have absolutely no doubt" that allende committed suicide.
according to isabel allende bussi—the daughter of salvador allende and currently a member of the chilean senate—the allende family has long accepted that the former president shot himself, telling the bbc that: "the report conclusions are consistent with what we already believed.
when faced with extreme circumstances, he made the decision of taking his own life, instead of being humiliated."
the definitive and unanimous results produced by the 2011 chilean judicial investigation appear to have laid to rest decades of nagging suspicions that allende might have been assassinated by the chilean armed forces.
but public acceptance of the suicide theory had already been growing for much of the previous decade.
in a post-junta chile where restrictions on free speech were steadily eroding, independent and seemingly reliable witnesses at last began to tell their stories to the news media and to human rights researchers.
the cumulative weight of the facts reported by these witnesses provided factual support for many previously unconfirmed details relating to allende's death.
the widespread acceptance of suicide as the cause salvador allende's death was, however, preceded by decades of speculation and controversializing about the circumstances surrounding his death.
several examples of pre-2011 speculation are shown below or on the wikipedia page regarding the death of salvador allende.
alternative views regarding the death of salvador allende:
well-known relatives of salvador allende include his daughter isabel allende bussi (a politician) and his first cousin once removed isabel allende llona (a writer).
memorials to allende include a statue in front of the palacio de la moneda.
the placement of the statue was controversial; it was placed facing the eastern edge of the plaza de la ciudadanía, a plaza which contains memorials to a number of chilean statesmen.
however, the statue is not located in the plaza, but rather on a surrounding sidewalk facing an entrance to the plaza.
allende is buried in the general cemetery of santiago.
his tomb is a major tourist attraction.
in nicaragua, the tourist port of managua is named after him.
the salvador allende port is located near downtown managua.
the broken glasses of allende were given to the chilean national history museum in 1996 by a woman who had found them in la moneda in 1973.
a residential street in toronto has also been named after him.
allende avenue in harlow, essex, is named after him.
there is also a square in the 7th arrondissement of paris named after him, near the chilean embassy.
there is a square named after him in viladecans, near barcelona, called plaza de salvador allende.
there is an avenue (salvador allende straße)and a nearby bridge in berlin, germany named after him.

simón josé antonio de la santísima trinidad bolívar y palacios ponte-andrade y blanco (24 july 1783 – 17 december 1830), generally known as simón bolívar (spanish: [siˈmom boˈliβaɾ] (listen),[a] english: /ˈbɒlɪvər, -vɑːr/ bol-iv-ər, -⁠ar also us: /ˈboʊlɪvɑːr/ boh-liv-ar) and also colloquially as el libertador,  or the liberator, was a venezuelan military and political leader who led what are currently the states of venezuela, bolivia, colombia, ecuador, peru, and panama to independence from the spanish empire.
bolívar was born into a wealthy, aristocratic criollo family and, as was common for the heirs of upper-class families in his day, was sent to be educated abroad at a young age, arriving in spain when he was 16 and later moving to france.
while in europe he was introduced to the ideas of the enlightenment, which later motivated him to overthrow the reigning spanish in colonial south america.
taking advantage of the disorder in spain prompted by the peninsular war, bolívar began his campaign for independence in 1808. the campaign for the independence of new granada was consolidated with the victory at the battle of boyacá on 7 august 1819. he established an organized national congress within three years.
despite a number of hindrances, including the arrival of an unprecedentedly large spanish expeditionary force, the revolutionaries eventually prevailed, culminating in the patriot victory at the battle of carabobo in 1821, which effectively made venezuela an independent country.
following this triumph over the spanish monarchy, bolívar participated in the foundation of the first union of independent nations in latin america, gran colombia, of which he was president from 1819 to 1830. through further military campaigns, he ousted spanish rulers from ecuador, peru, and bolivia, the last of which was named after him.
he was simultaneously president of gran colombia (present-day venezuela, colombia, panama and ecuador), peru, and bolivia, but soon after, his second-in-command, antonio josé de sucre, was appointed president of bolivia.
bolívar aimed at a strong and united spanish america able to cope not only with the threats emanating from spain and the european holy alliance but also with the emerging power of the united states.
at the peak of his power, bolívar ruled over a vast territory from the argentine border to the caribbean sea.
bolívar fought 472 battles, of which 79 were important ones, and during his campaigns rode on horseback 123,000 kilometers, which is 10 times more than hannibal, three times more than napoleon, and twice as much as alexander the great.
bolívar is viewed as a national icon in much of modern south america, and is considered one of the great heroes of the hispanic independence movements of the early 19th century, along with josé de san martín, francisco de miranda and others.
towards the end of his life, bolívar despaired of the situation in his native region, with the famous quote "all who served the revolution have plowed the sea".
:450 in an address to the constituent congress of the republic of colombia, bolívar stated "fellow citizens!
i blush to say this: independence is the only benefit we have acquired, to the detriment of all the rest."
the surname bolívar originated with aristocrats from la puebla de bolívar, a small village in the basque country of spain.
bolívar's father came from the female line of the ardanza family.
his maternal grandmother was descended from families from the canary islands.
[b]
the bolívars settled in venezuela in the 16th century.
bolívar's first south american ancestor was simón de bolívar (or simon de bolibar; the spelling was not standardized until the 19th century), who lived and worked in santo domingo (the present-day dominican republic) from 1559 to 1560 and where his son simón de bolívar y castro was born.
when the governor was reassigned to venezuela by the spanish crown in 1569, simón de bolívar went with him.
as an early settler in spain's venezuela province, he became prominent in the local society, and he and his descendants were granted estates, encomiendas, and positions in the local cabildo.
when caracas cathedral was built in 1569, the bolívar family had one of the first dedicated side chapels.
the majority of the wealth of simón de bolívar's descendants came from the estates.
the most important was a sugar plantation with an encomienda that provided the labor needed to run the estate.
another portion of the bolívars' wealth came from silver, gold, and copper mines.
small gold deposits were first mined in venezuela in 1669, leading to the discovery of much more extensive copper deposits.
from his mother's side (the palacios family), bolívar inherited the aroa copper mines at cocorote.
native american and african slaves provided the majority of the labor in these mines.
toward the end of the 17th century, copper mining became so prominent in venezuela that the metal became known as cobre caracas ("caracas copper").
many of the mines became the property of the bolívar family.
bolívar's grandfather, juan de bolívar y martínez de villegas, paid 22,000 ducats to the monastery at santa maria de montserrat in 1728 for a title of nobility that had been granted by king philip v of spain for its maintenance.
the crown never issued the patent of nobility, and so the purchase became the subject of lawsuits that were still in progress during bolívar's lifetime, when independence from spain made the point moot.
(if the lawsuits had been successful, bolívar's older brother, juan vicente, would have become the marquess of san luis and viscount of cocorote.)
bolívar ultimately devoted his personal fortune to the revolution.
having been one of the wealthiest persons within the spanish american world at the beginning of the revolution, he died in poverty.
simón bolívar was born in a house in caracas, captaincy general of venezuela, on 24 july 1783.:6 he was baptized as simón josé antonio de la santísima trinidad bolívar y palacios.
his mother was maría de la concepción palacios y blanco, and his father was colonel don juan vicente bolívar y ponte.
he had two older sisters and a brother: maría antonia, juana, and juan vicente.
another sister, maría del carmen, died at birth.
when bolívar was an infant, he was cared for by doña ines manceba de miyares and the family's slave, hipólita.
a couple of years later, he returned to the care of his parents, but this experience would have a major effect on his life.
his father died before bolívar's third birthday to tuberculosis, and his mother died when he was almost nine.
after his mother's death, bolívar was placed in the custody of an instructor, miguel josé sanz, but this relationship did not work out and he was sent back home.
he went on to receive private lessons from the renowned professors andrés bello, guillermo pelgrón, jose antonio negrete, fernando vides, father andújar, and don simón rodríguez, formerly known as simón carreño.
don simón rodríguez became bolívar's teacher, friend and mentor.
he taught him how to swim and ride horses, as well as about liberty, human rights, politics, history, and sociology.
later in life, rodríguez was pivotal in bolívar's decision to start the revolution, instilling in him the ideas of liberty, enlightenment, and freedom.
in the meantime, bolívar was mostly cared for by his nurse, the slave hipólita, whom he later called "the only mother i have known".
when bolívar was fourteen, don simón rodríguez was forced to leave the country after being accused of involvement in a conspiracy against the spanish government in caracas.
bolívar then entered the military academy of the milicias de aragua.
in 1800, he was sent to spain to follow his military studies in madrid, where he remained until 1802. back in europe in 1804, he lived in france and traveled to different countries.
while in milan, bolívar witnessed the coronation of napoleon as king of italy (a kingdom in personal union with france in northern modern italy), an event that left a profound impression on him.
even if he disagreed with the crowning, he was highly sensitive to the popular veneration inspired by the hero.
bolívar returned to venezuela in 1807. after a coup on 19 april 1810, venezuela achieved de facto independence when the supreme junta of caracas was established and the colonial administrators deposed.
the supreme junta sent a delegation to great britain to get british recognition and aid.
this delegation presided by bolívar also included two future venezuelan notables andrés bello and luis lópez méndez.
the trio met with francisco de miranda and persuaded him to return to his native land.
in 1811, a delegation from the supreme junta, also including bolívar, and a crowd of commoners enthusiastically received miranda in la guaira.
during the insurgence war conducted by miranda, bolívar was promoted to colonel and was made commandant of puerto cabello the following year, 1812. as royalist frigate captain domingo de monteverde was advancing into republican territory from the west, bolívar lost control of san felipe castle along with its ammunition stores on 30 june 1812. bolívar then retreated to his estate in san mateo.
miranda saw the republican cause as lost and signed a capitulation agreement with monteverde on 25 july, an action that bolívar and other revolutionary officers deemed treasonous.
in one of bolívar's most morally dubious acts, he and others arrested miranda and handed him over to the spanish royal army at the port of la guaira.
for his apparent services to the royalist cause, monteverde granted bolívar a passport, and bolívar left for curaçao on 27 august.
it must be said, though, that bolívar protested to the spanish authorities about the reasons why he handled miranda, insisting that he was not lending a service to the crown but punishing a defector.
in 1813, he was given a military command in tunja, new granada (modern-day colombia), under the direction of the congress of united provinces of new granada, which had formed out of the juntas established in 1810.
this was the beginning of the admirable campaign.
on 24 may, bolívar entered mérida, where he was proclaimed el libertador ("the liberator").
this was followed by the occupation of trujillo on 9 june.
six days later, and as a result of spanish massacres on independence supporters,  bolívar dictated his famous "decree of war to the death", allowing the killing of any spaniard not actively supporting independence.
caracas was retaken on 6 august 1813, and bolívar was ratified as el libertador, establishing the second republic of venezuela.
the following year, because of the rebellion of josé tomás boves and the fall of the republic, bolívar returned to new granada, where he commanded a force for the united provinces.
his forces entered bogotá in 1814 and recaptured the city from the dissenting republican forces of cundinamarca.
bolívar intended to march into cartagena and enlist the aid of local forces in order to capture the royalist town of santa marta.
in 1815, however, after a number of political and military disputes with the government of cartagena, bolívar fled to jamaica, where he was denied support.
after an assassination attempt in jamaica, he fled to haiti, where he was granted protection.
he befriended alexandre pétion, the president of the recently independent southern republic (as opposed to the kingdom of haiti in the north), and petitioned him for aid.
—simón bolívar
in 1816, with haitian soldiers and vital material support, bolívar landed in venezuela and fulfilled his promise to pétion to free spanish america's slaves on 2 june 1816.:186
in july 1817, on a second expedition, he captured angostura after defeating the counter-attack of miguel de la torre.
:192–201 however, venezuela remained a captaincy of spain after the victory in 1818 by pablo morillo in the second battle of la puerta (es).
:212
on 15 february 1819, bolívar was able to open the venezuelan second national congress in angostura, in which he was elected president and francisco antonio zea was elected vice president.
:222–25 bolívar then decided that he would first fight for the independence of new granada, to gain resources of the vice royalty, intending later to consolidate the independence of venezuela.
the campaign for the independence of new granada, which included the crossing of the andes mountain range, one of history's military feats, was consolidated with the victory at the battle of boyacá on 7 august 1819.:233  bolívar returned to angostura, when congress passed a law forming a greater republic of colombia on 17 december, making bolívar president and zea vice president, with francisco de paula santander vice president on the new granada side, and juan germán roscio vice president on the venezuela side.
:246–47
morillo was left in control of caracas and the coastal highlands.
:248 after the restoration of the cádiz constitution, morillo ratified two treaties with bolívar on 25 november 1820, calling for a six-month armistice and recognizing bolívar as president of the republic.
:254–55  bolívar and morillo met in san fernando de apure on 27 november, after which morillo left venezuela for spain, leaving la torre in command.
:255–57
from his newly consolidated base of power, bolívar launched outright independence campaigns in venezuela and ecuador.
these campaigns concluded with the victory at the battle of carabobo, after which bolívar triumphantly entered caracas on 29 june 1821.:267 on 7 september 1821, gran colombia (a state covering much of modern colombia, ecuador, panama, and venezuela) was created, with bolívar as president and santander as vice president.
bolívar followed with the battle of bombona and the battle of pichincha, after which he entered quito on 16 june 1822.:287 on 26 and 27 july 1822, bolívar held the guayaquil conference with the argentine general josé de san martín, who had received the title of "protector of peruvian freedom" in august 1821 after partially liberating peru from the spanish.
:295 thereafter, bolívar took over the task of fully liberating peru.
the peruvian congress named him dictator of peru on 10 february 1824, which allowed bolívar to reorganize completely the political and military administration.
assisted by antonio josé de sucre, bolívar decisively defeated the spanish cavalry at the battle of junín on 6 august 1824. sucre destroyed the still numerically superior remnants of the spanish forces at ayacucho on 9 december 1824.
according to british historian robert harvey:
bolívar achievements in peru had been as staggering as any in his career of a year, from holding a strip of the country's north coast while himself nearly moribund, he and sucre had taken on and defeated an army of 18,000 men and secured a country the size of nearly all of western europe...the investment of personal energy, the distances covered and the four army expeditions across supposedly impassable mountain ranges had qualified him for superhuman status...his stamina and military achievements put him at the forefront of the global heroes of history.
writing to united states secretary of state john quincy adams in 1824, united states consul in peru william tudor stated:
unfortunately for peru, the invaders who came to proclaim liberty and independence were cruel, rapacious, unprincipled and incapable.
their mismanagement, their profligacy, and their thirst for plunder soon alienated the affections of the inhabitants.
even though bolívar condemned the corrupt practices of the spanish, he ordered some churches stripped of their decorations.
on 19 march 1824, josé gabriel pérez wrote to antonio josé de sucre about the orders given to him by bolívar; pérez talked about "all the ordinary and extraordinary means" that should be applied to assure the subsistence of the patriot army.
indeed, pérez said that bolívar issued instructions to take from churches "all golden and silver jewels" in order to coin them and pay war expenditures.
days later, bolívar himself said to sucre that there would be a complete lack of resources unless severe actions were taken against "the jewels of the churches, everywhere".
on 6 august 1825, at the congress of upper peru, the "republic of bolivia" was created.
:346 bolívar is thus one of the few people to have a country named after him.
bolívar returned to caracas on 12 january 1827, and then back to bogotá.
:369, 378, 408
bolívar had great difficulties maintaining control of the vast gran colombia.
in 1826, internal divisions sparked dissent throughout the nation, and regional uprisings erupted in venezuela.
the new south american union had revealed its fragility and appeared to be on the verge of collapse.
to preserve the union, an amnesty was declared and an arrangement was reached with the venezuelan rebels, but this increased the political dissent in neighboring new granada.
in an attempt to keep the nation together as a single entity, bolívar called for a constitutional convention at ocaña in march 1828.
bolívar thought that a federation like the one founded in the united states was unworkable in the spanish america.
:106, 166 for this reason, and to prevent a break-up, bolívar sought to implement a more centralist model of government in gran colombia, including some or all of the elements of the bolivian constitution he had written, which included a lifetime presidency with the ability to select a successor (although this presidency was to be held in check by an intricate system of balances).
:351
this move was considered controversial in new granada and was one of the reasons for the deliberations, which met from 9 april to 10 june 1828. the convention almost ended up drafting a document which would have implemented a radically federalist form of government, which would have greatly reduced the powers of a central administration.
the federalist faction was able to command a majority for the draft of a new constitution which has definite federal characteristics despite its ostensibly centralist outline.
unhappy with what would be the ensuing result, pro-bolívar delegates withdrew from the convention, leaving it moribund.
two months after the failure of this congress to write a new constitution, bolívar was declared president-liberator in colombia's "organic decree".
:394 he considered this a temporary measure, as a means to reestablish his authority and save the republic, although it increased dissatisfaction and anger among his political opponents.
:408 an assassination attempt on 25 september 1828 failed (in spanish it is indeed known as the noche septembrina), thanks to the help of his lover, manuela sáenz.
:399–405 bolívar afterward described manuela as "liberatrix of the liberator".
:403 dissent continued, and uprisings occurred in new granada, venezuela, and ecuador during the next two years.
bolivar initially tried to forgive those who were considered conspirators, members of the "santander" faction.
eventually it was decided to submit them to martial justice, after which those accused of being directly involved were executed, some without having their guilt fully established.
santander, who had known in advance of the conspiracy and had not directly opposed it because of his differences with bolivar, was condemned to death.
bolivar, though, commuted the sentence.
after the facts, bolivar continued to govern in a rarefied environment, cornered by fractional disputes.
uprisings occurred in new granada, venezuela, and ecuador during the following two years.
the separatists accused him of betraying republican principles and of wanting to establish a permanent dictatorship.
gran colombia declared war against peru when president general la mar invaded guayaquil.
he was later defeated by marshall antonio josé de sucre in the battle of the portete de tarqui, 27 february 1829. sucre was killed on 4 june 1830. general juan josé flores wanted to separate the southern departments (quito, guayaquil, and azuay), known as the district of ecuador, from gran colombia to form an independent country and become its first president.
venezuela was proclaimed independent on 13 january 1830 and josé antonio páez maintained the presidency of that country, banishing bolivar.
for bolívar, hispanic america was the fatherland.
he dreamed of a united spanish america and in the pursuit of that purpose he not only created gran colombia but also the confederation of the andes whose aim was to unite the aforementioned with peru and bolivia.
moreover, he promoted a network of treaties keeping the newly liberated south american countries together.
nonetheless, he was unable to control the centrifugal process which pushed outwards in all directions.
on 20 january 1830, as his dream fell apart, bolívar delivered his final address to the nation, announcing that he would be stepping down from the presidency of gran colombia.
in his speech, a distraught bolívar urged the people to maintain the union and to be wary of the intentions of those who advocated for separation.
(at the time, "colombians" referred to the people of gran colombia (venezuela, new granada, and ecuador), not modern-day colombia):
simón bolívar
colombians!
today i cease to govern you.
i have served you for twenty years as soldier and leader.
during this long period we have taken back our country, liberated three republics, fomented many civil wars, and four times i have returned to the people their omnipotence, convening personally four constitutional congresses.
these services were inspired by your virtues, your courage, and your patriotism; mine is the great privilege of having governed you.
the constitutional congress convened on this day is charged by providence with the task of giving the nation the institutions she desires, following the course of circumstances and the nature of things.
fearing that i may be regarded as an obstacle to establishing the republic on the true base of its happiness, i personally have cast myself down from the supreme position of leadership to which your generosity had elevated me.
colombians!
i have been the victim of ignominious suspicions, with no possible way to defend the purity of my principles.
the same persons who aspire to the supreme command have conspired to tear your hearts from me, attributing to me their own motives, making me seem to be the instigator of projects they themselves have conceived, representing me, finally, as aspiring to a crown which they themselves have offered on more than one occasion and which i have rejected with the indignation of the fiercest republican.
never, never, i swear to you, has it crossed my mind to aspire to a kingship that my enemies have fabricated in order to ruin me in your regard.
do not be deceived, colombians!
my only desire has been to contribute to your freedom and to be the preservation of your peace of mind.
if for this i am held guilty, i deserve your censure more than any man.
do not listen, i beg you, to the vile slander and the tawdry envy stirring up discord on all sides.
will you allow yourself to be deceived by the false accusations of my detractors?
please don't be foolish!
colombians!
gather around the constitutional congress.
it represents the wisdom of the nation, the legitimate hope of the people, and the final point of reunion of the patriots.
its sovereign decrees will determine our lives, the happiness of the republic, and the glory of colombia.
if dire circumstances should cause you to abandon it, there will be no health for the country, and you will drown in the ocean of anarchy, leaving as your children's legacy nothing but crime, blood, and death.
fellow countrymen!
hear my final plea as i end my political career; in the name of colombia i ask you, beg you, to remain united, lest you become the assassins of the country and your own executioners.
bolívar
bolívar ultimately failed in his attempt to prevent the collapse of the union.
gran colombia was dissolved later that year and was replaced by the republics of venezuela, new granada, and ecuador.
ironically, these countries were established as centralist nations, and would be governed for decades this way by leaders who, during bolívar's last years, had accused him of betraying republican principles and of wanting to establish a permanent dictatorship.
these separatists, among them josé antonio páez and francisco de paula santander, had justified their opposition to bolívar for this reason and publicly denounced him as a monarch.
some of them had in the past been accused of plotting against bolívar's life (santander, who governed the second centralist government of new granada, was associated with the september conspiracy).
josé maría obando, the first president of the republic of new granada (that succeeded the gran colombia), had been directly linked to the assassination of antonio josé de sucre in 1830. sucre was regarded by some as a political threat because of his popularity after he led a resounding patriot victory at the battle of ayacucho, ending the war against the spanish empire in south america.
bolívar also considered him his direct successor and had attempted to make him vice president of gran colombia after francisco de paula santander was exiled in 1828.
for the rest of the 19th century and into the early 20th century, the political environment of latin america was fraught with civil wars and characterized by a sociopolitical phenomenon known as caudillismo, which became very common in venezuela, especially after 1830.
indeed, such struggles already existed shortly after the patriot victory over the loyalists because the former spanish colonies created new nations that proclaimed their own autonomous states, which produced military confrontations with political conspirations that sent some of the former independence heroes into exile.
moreover, there were attempts by the spanish monarchy to reconquer their former settlements in the americas through expeditions that would help the remaining loyalist forces and advocates.
however, the attempts generally failed in venezuela, perú and mexico; thus, the loyalist resistance forces against the republic were finally defeated.
the main characteristic of caudillismo was the arrival of authoritarian but charismatic political figures who would typically rise to power in an unconventional way, often legitimizing their right to govern through undemocratic processes.
these caudillos maintained their control primarily on the basis of their personalities, as well as skewed interpretations of their popularity and what constituted a majority among the masses.
on his deathbed, bolívar envisaged the emergence of countless caudillos competing for the pieces of the great nation he once dreamed about.
saying that "all who served the revolution have plowed the sea",:450 bolívar finally resigned the presidency on 27 april 1830, intending to leave the country for exile in europe.
:435 he had already sent several crates containing his belongings and writings ahead of him to europe, but he died before setting sail from cartagena.
on 17 december 1830, at the age of 47, simón bolívar died of tuberculosis in the quinta de san pedro alejandrino in santa marta, gran colombia (now colombia).
on his deathbed, bolívar asked his aide-de-camp, general daniel f. o'leary, to burn the remaining extensive archive of his writings, letters, and speeches.
o'leary disobeyed the order and his writings survived, providing historians with a wealth of information about bolívar's liberal philosophy and thought, as well as details of his personal life, such as his long love affair with manuela sáenz.
shortly before her own death in 1856, sáenz augmented this collection by giving o'leary her own letters from bolívar.
bolívar's remains were buried in the cathedral of santa marta.
twelve years later, in 1842, at the request of president josé antonio páez, they were moved from santa marta to caracas, where they were buried in the cathedral of caracas together with the remains of his wife and parents.
in 1876, he was moved to a monument set up for his interment at the national pantheon of venezuela.
the quinta near santa marta has been preserved as a museum with numerous references to his life.
in 2010, symbolic remains of bolívar's later-years lover, manuela sáenz, were also interred in venezuela's national pantheon.
on january 2008, then-president of venezuela hugo chávez set up a commission to investigate theories that bolívar was the victim of an assassination.
on several occasions, chávez has claimed that bolívar was in fact poisoned by "new granada traitors".
in april 2010, infectious diseases specialist paul auwaerter studied records of bolívar's symptoms and concluded that he might have suffered from chronic arsenic poisoning, but that both acute poisoning and murder were unlikely.
in july 2010, bolívar's body was ordered to be exhumed to advance the investigations.
in july 2011, international forensics experts released their report, claiming there was no proof of poisoning or any other unnatural cause of death.
in 1799, following the early deaths of his father juan vicente (dead since 1786) and his mother concepción (who died in 1792), bolívar traveled to mexico, france, and spain, at the age of 16 years, to complete his education.
while in madrid during 1802 and after a two-year courtship, he married maría teresa rodríguez del toro y alaiza, who was to be his only wife.
she was related to the aristocratic families of the marquis del toro of caracas and the marquis de inicio of madrid.
eight months after returning to venezuela with him, she died from yellow fever on 22 january 1803. bolívar was so devastated by this loss that his relatives feared for his life.
he swore never to marry again, a promise he kept.
many years later bolívar would refer to the death of his wife as the turning point of his life.
indeed, in 1828, he told luis perú de lacroix the following words:
not surprisingly, spanish historian salvador de madariaga refers to the death of bolivar's wife as one of the key moments in hispanic america's history.
in 1804, he traveled again to europe in an attempt to ease his pain and began falling into a dissolute life.
it was then that he met again with his old teacher simón rodríguez in paris, who little by little was able to transform his acute depression into a sense of commitment towards a greater cause: the independence of venezuela.
he lived in napoleonic france for a while and undertook the grand tour.
during this time in europe, bolívar met the intellectual explorer, alexander von humboldt in rome.
humboldt later wrote: "i was wrong back then, when i judged him a puerile man, incapable of realizing so grand an ambition.
":64
bolívar had several love affairs.
most of them were ephemeral and did not last long.
historians, scholars and biographers often agree with the names of the most prominent women who stood with bolívar, such as josefina "pepita" machado, fanny du villars and manuela sáenz.
manuela sáenz was the most important of those women.
she was more than a lover in bolívar's later life; she became a trustworthy confidant and advisor.
moreover, manuela saved bolívar's life during the september conspiracy of 1828 in which bolívar was about to be killed.
during such assassination attempt, manuela diverted the assassins and thus gave bolívar enough time to escape from his room.
bolívar and manuela met in quito on 22 june 1822 and they began a long-term affair.
the relationship was controversial at the time, because manuela was already married to james thorne, but they became estranged in 1822 due to irreconcilable differences.
the emotional ties between manuela and bolívar were strong, and manuela attempted suicide when she received the news of bolívar's death.
despite sometimes living in the same south american cities (such as bogotá, quito and lima), bolívar and manuela did not always have a face-to-face relationship.
this romance was clear in their letters, but few of them have survived.
most of her letters were destroyed after manuela's death.
contrary to the arguments exposed by heinz dieterich, carlos álvarez saá, and a book edited by fundación editorial el perro y la rana publishing house in 2007, several letters attributed to both bolívar and manuela are intentional forgeries.
in his memoirs of simón bolívar, henri la fayette villaume ducoudray holstein (who himself has been called a "not-always-reliable and never impartial witness") described the young bolívar as he was attempting to seize power in venezuela and new granada in 1814–1816.
ducoudray holstein joined bolívar and served on his staff as an officer during this period.
he describes bolívar as a coward who repeatedly abandoned his military commission in front of the enemy, and also as a great lover of women, being accompanied at all times by two or more of his mistresses during the military operations.
he would not hesitate to stop the fleet transporting the whole army and bound for margarita island during two days in order to wait for his mistress to join his ship.
according to ducoudray holstein, bolívar behaved essentially as an opportunist preferring intrigues and secret manipulation to an open fight.
he was also deemed incompetent in military matters, systematically avoiding any risks and permanently anxious for his own safety.
in the diario de bucaramanga, bolívar's opinion of ducoudray is presented when louis peru de lacroix asked who had been bolívar's aides-de-camp since he had been general; he mentioned charles eloi demarquet and ducoudray.
bolívar confirmed the first but denied the second, saying that he had met him in 1815 and accepted his services, even admitting him to his general staff, but "i never trusted him enough to make him my aide-de-camp; to the contrary, i had a very unfavorable idea of his person and his services", and that ducoudray's departure after only a brief stay had been a "real pleasure."
karl marx
according to beddow and thibodeaux, karl marx dismissed bolívar as a "falsifier, deserter, conspirator, liar, coward and looter", and a "false liberator who merely sought to preserve the power of the old creole nobility to which he belonged".
in an unsympathetic biography titled bolívar y ponte, simón, published in the new american cyclopedia, karl marx criticized much of bolívar's life.
marx begins by saying that bolívar was born to a family of "creole nobility in venezuela" and that similar to the "custom of wealthy americans of those times, at the early age of 14 he was sent to europe".
at several points in marx's piece, he complains that bolívar abandoned his troops multiple times and writes that bolívar had to be persuaded by his cousin ribas to return to fight against the spanish after staying in cartagena.
marx then penned that after arriving in caracas in 1813, bolívar's "dictatorship soon proved a military anarchy, leaving the most important affairs in the hands of favorites, who squandered the finances of the country, and then resorted to odious means in order to restore them".
at the conclusion of the biography, marx uses ducoudray holstein's description of bolívar.
bolívar had no children, possibly because of infertility caused by having contracted measles and mumps as a child.
his closest living relatives descend from his sisters and brother.
one of his sisters died in infancy.
his sister juana bolívar y palacios married their maternal uncle, dionisio palacios y blanco, and had two children, guillermo and benigna.
guillermo palacios died fighting alongside his uncle simón in the battle of la hogaza on 2 december 1817. benigna had two marriages, the first to pedro briceño méndez and the second to pedro amestoy.
their great-grandchildren, bolívar's closest living relatives, pedro, and eduardo mendoza goiticoa lived in caracas as of 2009.
his eldest sister, maría antonia, married pablo clemente francia and had four children: josefa, anacleto, valentina, and pablo.
maría antonia became bolívar's agent to deal with his properties while he served as president of gran colombia and she was an executrix of his will.
she retired to bolívar's estate in macarao, which she inherited from him.
his older brother, juan vicente, who died in 1811 on a diplomatic mission to the united states, had three children born out of wedlock whom he recognized: juan, fernando simón, and felicia bolívar tinoco.
bolívar provided for the children and their mother after his brother's death.
bolívar was especially close to fernando and in 1822 sent him to study in the united states, where he attended the university of virginia.
in his long life, fernando had minor participation in some of the major political events of venezuelan history and also traveled and lived extensively throughout europe.
he had three children, benjamín bolívar gauthier, santiago hernández bolívar, and claudio bolívar taraja.
fernando died in 1898 at the age of 88.
simón bolívar was an admirer of both the u.s. and french revolutions.
:35, 52–53 bolívar even enrolled his nephew, fernando bolívar, in a private school in philadelphia, germantown academy, and paid for his education, including attendance at thomas jefferson's university of virginia.
:71–72, 369 while he was an admirer of u.s. independence, he did not believe that its governmental system could work in latin america.
thus, he claimed that the governance of heterogeneous societies like venezuela "will require a firm hand".
bolívar felt that the u.s. had been established in land especially fertile for democracy.
by contrast, he referred to spanish america as having been subject to the "triple yoke of ignorance, tyranny, and vice".
:224 if a republic could be established in such a land, in his mind, it would have to make some concessions in terms of liberty.
this is shown when bolívar blamed the fall of the first republic on his subordinates trying to imitate "some ethereal republic" and in the process, not paying attention to the gritty political reality of south america.
among the books accompanying him as he traveled were adam smith's the wealth of nations, voltaire's letters and, when he was writing the bolivian constitution, montesquieu's the spirit of the laws.
his bolivian constitution placed him within the camp of what would become latin american conservatism in the later nineteenth century.
the bolivian constitution intended to establish a lifelong presidency and a hereditary senate, essentially recreating the british unwritten constitution, as it existed at the time.
according to carlos fuentes:
how to govern ourselves after winning independence.
it can be said that the liberator exhausted his soul trying to find an answer to that question...bolívar tried to avoid the extremes that would overwhelm spanish america all along the nineteenth century and part of the twentieth.
tyranny or anarchy?
'do not aim at what is impossible to attain, because in the quest for liberty we may fall into tyranny.
absolute liberty always leads to absolute power and among these two extremes is social liberty'.
in order to find this equilibrium, bolívar proposed a 'clever despotism', a strong executive power able to impose equality there where racial inequality prevailed.
bolívar warned against an 'aristocracy of rank, employment and fortune' that while 'referring to liberty and guarantee' it would just be for themselves but not for levelling with members of lower classes'...he is the disciple of montesquieu in his insistence that institutions have to be adapted to culture.
similarly to some others in the history of american independence (george washington, miguel hidalgo, josé de san martín, bernardo o'higgins, francisco de paula santander, antonio nariño, and francisco de miranda), simón bolívar was a freemason.
he was initiated in 1803 in the masonic lodge lautaro, which operated in cádiz, spain,.
it was in this lodge that he first met some of his revolutionary peers, such as josé de san martín.
in may 1806 he was conferred the rank of master mason in the "scottish mother of st. alexander of scotland" in paris.
during his time in london, he frequented "the great american reunion" lodge in london, founded by francisco de miranda.
in april 1824, simón bolívar was given the 33rd degree of inspector general honorary.
he founded the masonic lodge no.
2 of peru, named "order and liberty".
due to the historical relevance of bolívar as a key element during the process of independence in hispanic america, his memory has been strongly attached to sentiments of nationalism and patriotism, being a recurrent theme of rhetoric in politics.
since the image of bolívar became an important part to the national identities of venezuela, colombia, panama, ecuador, peru and bolivia, his mantle is often claimed by hispanic american politicians all across the political spectrum.
[citation needed]
in venezuela, bolívar left behind a militarist legacy with multiple governments utilizing the memory, image and written legacy of bolívar as important parts of their political messages and propaganda.
bolívar disapproved of the excesses of "party spirit" and "factions", which led to an anti-political environment in venezuela.
for much of the 1800s, venezuela was ruled by caudillos, with six rebellions occurring to take control of venezuela between 1892 and 1900 alone.
the militarist legacy was then used by the nationalist dictatorship of marcos pérez jiménez and more recently the socialist political movement led by hugo chávez.
the nations of bolivia and the bolivarian republic of venezuela, and their respective currencies (the bolivian boliviano and the venezuelan bolívar), are all named after bolívar.
additionally, most cities and towns in colombia and venezuela are built around a main square known as plaza bolívar, as is the case with bogotá.
in this example, most governmental buildings and public structures are located on or around the plaza, including the national capitol and the palace of justice.
besides quito and caracas, there are monuments to bolívar in the latin american capitals of lima, buenos aires, havana, mexico city, panama city, paramaribo, san josé, santo domingo and sucre.
in bogotá, the simón bolívar park has hosted many concerts.
outside of latin america, the variety of monuments to simón bolívar are a continuing testament to his legacy.
these include statues in many capitals around the world, including algiers, ankara,[citation needed] bucharest, london, minsk, moscow, new delhi, ottawa, paris, prague, port-au-prince, rome, sofia, tehran, vienna and washington, d.c.. several cities in spain, especially in the basque country, have constructed monuments to bolívar, including a large monument in bilbao and a comprehensive venezuelan government-funded museum in cenarruza-puebla de bolívar, his ancestral hometown.
in the usa, an imposing bronze equestrian statue of simón bolívar stands at the southern entrance to central park at the avenue of the americas in new york city which also celebrates bolívar's contributions to latin america.
the bolivar peninsula in texas, bolivar county, mississippi, bolivar, new york, bolivar, west virginia and bolivar, tennessee are also named in his honor.
monuments to bolívar's military legacy also comprise one of venezuelan navy's sail training barques, which is named after him, and the uss simon bolivar, a benjamin franklin-class fleet ballistic missile submarine which served with the u.s. navy between 1965 and 1995.
minor planet 712 boliviana discovered by max wolf is named in his honor.
the name was suggested by camille flammarion.
the first venezuelan satellite, venesat-1, was given the alternative name simón bolívar after him.
his birthday is a public holiday in venezuela and bolivia.

bolívar has been depicted in opera, literature, film, and other media, and continues to be a part of the popular culture in many countries.
in 1883, to celebrate 100 years since his birth, the italian musician nicolò gabrielli composed the triumphal march simón bolívar and dedicated it to then president of venezuela antonio guzmán blanco.
in 1943 darius milhaud composed the opera bolívar.
he is also the central character in gabriel garcía márquez's 1989 novel the general in his labyrinth, in which he is portrayed in a less heroic but more humane manner than in most other parts of his legacy.
in 1969 maximilian schell played the role of simón bolívar in the film of the same name by director alessandro blasetti, which also featured actress rosanna schiaffino.
bolívar's life was also the basis of the 2013 film libertador, starring édgar ramírez and directed by alberto arvelo.
in an episode of the spanish tv series the ministry of time, "tiempo de ilustrados (time of the enlightened)", the time agents help him win the heart of his future wife, as this was considered fundamental for bolívar to fulfil his destiny.
later in the second season of the series the time agents will find him again in 1828 (two years before his death) to avoid his murder, planned by santander’s followers.
as of 2019, a netflix series has been released depicting bolívar's life and the major events surrounding it.
the netflix series is a colombian production with spanish as the main language.

an aurora (plural: auroras or aurorae),[a] sometimes referred to as polar lights, northern lights (aurora borealis), or southern lights (aurora australis), is a natural light display in the earth's sky, predominantly seen in the high-latitude regions (around the arctic and antarctic).
auroras are the result of disturbances in the magnetosphere caused by solar wind.
these disturbances are sometimes strong enough to alter the trajectories of charged particles in both solar wind and magnetospheric plasma.
these particles, mainly electrons and protons, precipitate into the upper atmosphere (thermosphere/exosphere).
the resulting ionization and excitation of atmospheric constituents emit light of varying color and complexity.
the form of the aurora, occurring within bands around both polar regions, is also dependent on the amount of acceleration imparted to the precipitating particles.
precipitating protons generally produce optical emissions as incident hydrogen atoms after gaining electrons from the atmosphere.
proton auroras are usually observed at lower latitudes.
the word "aurora" is derived from the name of the roman goddess of the dawn, aurora, who travelled from east to west announcing the coming of the sun.
ancient greek poets used the name metaphorically to refer to dawn, often mentioning its play of colours across the otherwise dark sky (e.g., "rosy-fingered dawn").
most auroras occur in a band known as the "auroral zone", which is typically 3° to 6° wide in latitude and between 10° and 20° from the geomagnetic poles at all local times (or longitudes), most clearly seen at night against a dark sky.
a region that currently displays an aurora is called the "auroral oval", a band displaced towards the night side of the earth.
early evidence for a geomagnetic connection comes from the statistics of auroral observations.
elias loomis (1860), and later hermann fritz (1881) and sophus tromholt (1881) in more detail, established that the aurora appeared mainly in the auroral zone.
day-to-day positions of the auroral ovals are posted on the internet.
in northern latitudes, the effect is known as the aurora borealis or the northern lights.
the former term was coined by galileo in 1619, from the roman goddess of the dawn and the greek name for the north wind.
the southern counterpart, the aurora australis or the southern lights, has features almost identical to the aurora borealis and changes simultaneously with changes in the northern auroral zone.
the aurora australis is visible from high southern latitudes in antarctica, chile, argentina, new zealand, and australia.
a geomagnetic storm causes the auroral ovals (north and south) to expand, bringing the aurora to lower latitudes.
the instantaneous distribution of auroras ("auroral oval") is slightly different, being centered about 3–5° nightward of the magnetic pole, so that auroral arcs reach furthest toward the equator when the magnetic pole in question is in between the observer and the sun.
the aurora can be seen best at this time, which is called magnetic midnight.
auroras seen within the auroral oval may be directly overhead, but from farther away, they illuminate the poleward horizon as a greenish glow, or sometimes a faint red, as if the sun were rising from an unusual direction.
auroras also occur poleward of the auroral zone as either diffuse patches or arcs, which can be subvisual.
auroras are occasionally seen in latitudes below the auroral zone, when a geomagnetic storm temporarily enlarges the auroral oval.
large geomagnetic storms are most common during the peak of the 11-year sunspot cycle or during the three years after the peak.an electron spirals (gyrates) about a field line at an angle that is determined by its velocity vectors, parallel and perpendicular, respectively, to the local geomagnetic field vector b. this angle is known as the "pitch angle" of the particle.
the distance, or radius, of the electron from the field line at any time is known as its larmor radius.
the pitch angle increases as the electron travels to a region of greater field strength nearer to the atmosphere.
thus, it is possible for some particles to return, or mirror, if the angle becomes 90° before entering the atmosphere to collide with the denser molecules there.
other particles that do not mirror enter the atmosphere and contribute to the auroral display over a range of altitudes.other types of auroras have been observed from space, e.g.
"poleward arcs" stretching sunward across the polar cap, the related "theta aurora", and "dayside arcs" near noon.
these are relatively infrequent and poorly understood.
other interesting effects occur such as flickering aurora, "black aurora" and subvisual red arcs.
in addition to all these, a weak glow (often deep red) observed around the two polar cusps, the field lines separating the ones that close through the earth from those that are swept into the tail and close remotely.
the altitudes where auroral emissions occur were revealed by carl størmer and his colleagues, who used cameras to triangulate more than 12,000 auroras.
they discovered that most of the light is produced between 90 and 150 km above the ground, while extending at times to more than 1000 km.images of auroras are significantly more common today than in the past due to the increase in the use of digital cameras that have high enough sensitivities.
film and digital exposure to auroral displays is fraught with difficulties.
due to the different color spectra present, and the temporal changes occurring during the exposure, the results are somewhat unpredictable.
different layers of the film emulsion respond differently to lower light levels, and choice of a film can be very important.
longer exposures superimpose rapidly changing features, and often blanket the dynamic attribute of a display.
higher sensitivity creates issues with graininess.
david malin pioneered multiple exposure using multiple filters for astronomical photography, recombining the images in the laboratory to recreate the visual display more accurately.
for scientific research, proxies are often used, such as ultraviolet, and color-correction to simulate the appearance to humans.
predictive techniques are also used, to indicate the extent of the display, a highly useful tool for aurora hunters.
terrestrial features often find their way into aurora images, making them more accessible and more likely to be published by major websites.
excellent images are possible with standard film (using iso ratings between 100 and 400) and a single-lens reflex camera with full aperture, a fast lens (f1.4 50 mm, for example), and exposures between 10 and 30 seconds, depending on the aurora's brightness.
early work on the imaging of the auroras was done in 1949 by the university of saskatchewan using the scr-270 radar.

diffuse aurora observed by de-1 satellite from high earth orbit
estonia, 18 march 2015
according to clark (2007), there are four main forms that can be seen from the ground, from least to most visible:
brekke (1994) also described some auroras as curtains.
the similarity to curtains is often enhanced by folds within the arcs.
arcs can fragment or break up into separate, at times rapidly changing, often rayed features that may fill the whole sky.
these are also known as discrete auroras, which are at times bright enough to read a newspaper by at night.
these forms are consistent with auroras' being shaped by earth's magnetic field.
the appearances of arcs, rays, curtains, and coronas are determined by the shapes of the luminous parts of the atmosphere and a viewer's position.
auroras change with time.
over the night, they begin with glows and progress towards coronas, although they may not reach them.
they tend to fade in the opposite order.
at shorter time scales, auroras can change their appearances and intensity, sometimes so slowly as to be difficult to notice, and at other times rapidly down to the sub-second scale.
the phenomenon of pulsating auroras is an example of intensity variations over short timescales, typically with periods of 2–20 seconds.
this type of aurora is generally accompanied by decreasing peak emission heights of about 8 km for blue and green emissions and above average solar wind speeds (~ 500 km/s).
in addition, the aurora and associated currents produce a strong radio emission around 150 khz known as auroral kilometric radiation (akr), discovered in 1972. ionospheric absorption makes akr only observable from space.
x-ray emissions, originating from the particles associated with auroras, have also been detected.
aurora noise, similar to a hissing, or crackling noise, begins about 70 m (230 ft) above the earth's surface and is caused by charged particles in an inversion layer of the atmosphere formed during a cold night.
the charged particles discharge when particles from the sun hit the inversion layer, creating the noise.
in 2016 more than fifty citizen science observations described what was to them an unknown type of aurora which they named "steve".
but steve is not an aurora but is caused by a 25 km (16 mi) wide ribbon of hot plasma at an altitude of 450 km (280 mi), with a temperature of 3,000 °c (3,270 k; 5,430 °f) and flowing at a speed of 6 km/s (3.7 mi/s) (compared to 10 m/s (33 ft/s) outside the ribbon).
the processes that cause steve also are associated with a picket-fence aurora, although the latter can be seen without steve.
it is an aurora because it is caused by precipitation of electrons in the atmosphere but it appears outside the auroral oval, closer to the equator than typical auroras.
when the picket-fence aurora appears with steve, it is below.
a full understanding of the physical processes which lead to different types of auroras is still incomplete, but the basic cause involves the interaction of the solar wind with the earth's magnetosphere.
the varying intensity of the solar wind produces effects of different magnitudes but includes one or more of the following physical scenarios.
the details of these phenomena are not fully understood.
however, it is clear that the prime source of auroral particles is the solar wind feeding the magnetosphere, the reservoir containing the radiation zones and temporarily magnetically-trapped particles confined by the geomagnetic field, coupled with particle acceleration processes.
the immediate cause of the ionization and excitation of atmospheric constituents leading to auroral emissions was discovered in 1960, when a pioneering rocket flight from fort churchill in canada revealed a flux of electrons entering the atmosphere from above.
since then an extensive collection of measurements has been acquired painstakingly and with steadily improving resolution since the 1960s by many research teams using rockets and satellites to traverse the auroral zone.
the main findings have been that auroral arcs and other bright forms are due to electrons that have been accelerated during the final few 10,000 km or so of their plunge into the atmosphere.
these electrons often, but not always, exhibit a peak in their energy distribution, and are preferentially aligned along the local direction of the magnetic field.electrons mainly responsible for diffuse and pulsating auroras have, in contrast, a smoothly falling energy distribution, and an angular (pitch-angle) distribution favouring directions perpendicular to the local magnetic field.
pulsations were discovered to originate at or close to the equatorial crossing point of auroral zone magnetic field lines.
protons are also associated with auroras, both discrete and diffuse.
auroras result from emissions of photons in the earth's upper atmosphere, above 80 km (50 mi), from ionized nitrogen atoms regaining an electron, and oxygen atoms and nitrogen based molecules returning from an excited state to ground state.
they are ionized or excited by the collision of particles precipitated into the atmosphere.
both incoming electrons and protons may be involved.
excitation energy is lost within the atmosphere by the emission of a photon, or by collision with another atom or molecule:
oxygen is unusual in terms of its return to ground state: it can take 0.7 seconds to emit the 557.7 nm green light and up to two minutes for the red 630.0 nm emission.
collisions with other atoms or molecules absorb the excitation energy and prevent emission, this process is called collisional quenching.
because the highest parts of the atmosphere contain a higher percentage of oxygen and lower particle densities, such collisions are rare enough to allow time for oxygen to emit red light.
collisions become more frequent progressing down into the atmosphere due to increasing density, so that red emissions do not have time to happen, and eventually, even green light emissions are prevented.this is why there is a color differential with altitude; at high altitudes oxygen red dominates, then oxygen green and nitrogen blue/purple/red, then finally nitrogen blue/purple/red when collisions prevent oxygen from emitting anything.
green is the most common color.
then comes pink, a mixture of light green and red, followed by pure red, then yellow (a mixture of red and green), and finally, pure blue.
bright auroras are generally associated with birkeland currents (schield et al., 1969; zmuda and armstrong, 1973), which flow down into the ionosphere on one side of the pole and out on the other.
in between, some of the current connects directly through the ionospheric e layer (125 km); the rest ("region 2") detours, leaving again through field lines closer to the equator and closing through the "partial ring current" carried by magnetically trapped plasma.
the ionosphere is an ohmic conductor, so some consider that such currents require a driving voltage, which an, as yet unspecified, dynamo mechanism can supply.
electric field probes in orbit above the polar cap suggest voltages of the order of 40,000 volts, rising up to more than 200,000 volts during intense magnetic storms.
in another interpretation, the currents are the direct result of electron acceleration into the atmosphere by wave/particle interactions.
ionospheric resistance has a complex nature, and leads to a secondary hall current flow.
by a strange twist of physics, the magnetic disturbance on the ground due to the main current almost cancels out, so most of the observed effect of auroras is due to a secondary current, the auroral electrojet.
an auroral electrojet index (measured in nanotesla) is regularly derived from ground data and serves as a general measure of auroral activity.
kristian birkeland deduced that the currents flowed in the east–west directions along the auroral arc, and such currents, flowing from the dayside toward (approximately) midnight were later named "auroral electrojets" (see also birkeland currents).
the earth is constantly immersed in the solar wind, a rarefied flow of hot plasma (a gas of free electrons and positive ions) emitted by the sun in all directions, a result of the two-million-degree temperature of the sun's outermost layer, the corona.
the solar wind reaches earth with a velocity typically around 400 km/s, a density of around 5 ions/cm3 and a magnetic field intensity of around 2–5 nt (for comparison, earth's surface field is typically 30,000–50,000 nt).
during magnetic storms, in particular, flows can be several times faster; the interplanetary magnetic field (imf) may also be much stronger.
joan feynman deduced in the 1970s that the long-term averages of solar wind speed correlated with geomagnetic activity.
her work resulted from data collected by the explorer 33 spacecraft.the solar wind and magnetosphere consist of plasma (ionized gas), which conducts electricity.
it is well known (since michael faraday's work around 1830) that when an electrical conductor is placed within a magnetic field while relative motion occurs in a direction that the conductor cuts across (or is cut by), rather than along, the lines of the magnetic field, an electric current is induced within the conductor.
the strength of the current depends on a) the rate of relative motion, b) the strength of the magnetic field, c) the number of conductors ganged together and d) the distance between the conductor and the magnetic field, while the direction of flow is dependent upon the direction of relative motion.
dynamos make use of this basic process ("the dynamo effect"), any and all conductors, solid or otherwise are so affected, including plasmas and other fluids.the imf originates on the sun, linked to the sunspots, and its field lines (lines of force) are dragged out by the solar wind.
that alone would tend to line them up in the sun-earth direction, but the rotation of the sun angles them at earth by about 45 degrees forming a spiral in the ecliptic plane), known as the parker spiral.
the field lines passing earth are therefore usually linked to those near the western edge ("limb") of the visible sun at any time.the solar wind and the magnetosphere, being two electrically conducting fluids in relative motion, should be able in principle to generate electric currents by dynamo action and impart energy from the flow of the solar wind.
however, this process is hampered by the fact that plasmas conduct readily along magnetic field lines, but less readily perpendicular to them.
energy is more effectively transferred by the temporary magnetic connection between the field lines of the solar wind and those of the magnetosphere.
unsurprisingly this process is known as magnetic reconnection.
as already mentioned, it happens most readily when the interplanetary field is directed southward, in a similar direction to the geomagnetic field in the inner regions of both the north magnetic pole and south magnetic pole.
auroras are more frequent and brighter during the intense phase of the solar cycle when coronal mass ejections increase the intensity of the solar wind.
earth's magnetosphere is shaped by the impact of the solar wind on the earth's magnetic field.
this forms an obstacle to the flow, diverting it, at an average distance of about 70,000 km (11 earth radii or re), producing a bow shock 12,000 km to 15,000 km (1.9 to 2.4 re) further upstream.
the width of the magnetosphere abreast of earth, is typically 190,000 km (30 re), and on the night side a long "magnetotail" of stretched field lines extends to great distances (> 200 re).the high latitude magnetosphere is filled with plasma as the solar wind passes the earth.
the flow of plasma into the magnetosphere increases with additional turbulence, density, and speed in the solar wind.
this flow is favored by a southward component of the imf, which can then directly connect to the high latitude geomagnetic field lines.
the flow pattern of magnetospheric plasma is mainly from the magnetotail toward the earth, around the earth and back into the solar wind through the magnetopause on the day-side.
in addition to moving perpendicular to the earth's magnetic field, some magnetospheric plasma travels down along the earth's magnetic field lines, gains additional energy and loses it to the atmosphere in the auroral zones.
the cusps of the magnetosphere, separating geomagnetic field lines that close through the earth from those that close remotely allow a small amount of solar wind to directly reach the top of the atmosphere, producing an auroral glow.on 26 february 2008, themis probes were able to determine, for the first time, the triggering event for the onset of magnetospheric substorms.
two of the five probes, positioned approximately one third the distance to the moon, measured events suggesting a magnetic reconnection event 96 seconds prior to auroral intensification.
geomagnetic storms that ignite auroras may occur more often during the months around the equinoxes.
it is not well understood, but geomagnetic storms may vary with earth's seasons.
two factors to consider are the tilt of both the solar and earth's axis to the ecliptic plane.
as the earth orbits throughout a year, it experiences an interplanetary magnetic field (imf) from different latitudes of the sun, which is tilted at 8 degrees.
similarly, the 23-degree tilt of the earth's axis about which the geomagnetic pole rotates with a diurnal variation changes the daily average angle that the geomagnetic field presents to the incident imf throughout a year.
these factors combined can lead to minor cyclical changes in the detailed way that the imf links to the magnetosphere.
in turn, this affects the average probability of opening a door through which energy from the solar wind can reach the earth's inner magnetosphere and thereby enhance auroras.
the electrons responsible for the brightest forms of the aurora are well accounted for by their acceleration in the dynamic electric fields of plasma turbulence encountered during precipitation from the magnetosphere into the auroral atmosphere.
in contrast, static electric fields are unable to transfer energy to the electrons due to their conservative nature.
the electrons and ions that cause the diffuse aurora appear not to be accelerated during precipitation.the increase in strength of magnetic field lines towards the earth creates a 'magnetic mirror' that turns back many of the downward flowing electrons.
the bright forms of auroras are produced when downward acceleration not only increases the energy of precipitating electrons but also reduces their pitch angles (angle between electron velocity and the local magnetic field vector).
this greatly increases the rate of deposition of energy into the atmosphere, and thereby the rates of ionization, excitation and consequent emission of auroral light.
acceleration also increases the electron current flowing between the atmosphere and magnetosphere.
one early theory proposed for the acceleration of auroral electrons is based on an assumed static, or quasi-static, electric field creating a uni-directional potential drop.
no mention is provided of either the necessary space-charge or equipotential distribution, and these remain to be specified for the notion of acceleration by double layers to be credible.
fundamentally, poisson's equation indicates that there can be no configuration of charge resulting in a net potential drop.
inexplicably though, some authors still invoke quasi-static parallel electric fields as net accelerators of auroral electrons, citing interpretations of transient observations of fields and particles as supporting this theory as firm fact.
in another example, there is little justification given for saying 'fast observations demonstrate detailed quantitative agreement between the measured electric potentials and the ion beam energies...., leaving no doubt that parallel potential drops are a dominant source of auroral particle acceleration'.
another theory is based on acceleration by landau resonance in the turbulent electric fields of the acceleration region.
this process is essentially the same as that employed in plasma fusion laboratories throughout the world, and appears well able to account in principle for most – if not all – detailed properties of the electrons responsible for the brightest forms of auroras, above, below and within the acceleration region.
other mechanisms have also been proposed, in particular, alfvén waves, wave modes involving the magnetic field first noted by hannes alfvén (1942), which have been observed in the laboratory and in space.
the question is whether these waves might just be a different way of looking at the above process, however, because this approach does not point out a different energy source, and many plasma bulk phenomena can also be described in terms of alfvén waves.other processes are also involved in the aurora, and much remains to be learned.
auroral electrons created by large geomagnetic storms often seem to have energies below 1 kev and are stopped higher up, near 200 km.
such low energies excite mainly the red line of oxygen so that often such auroras are red.
on the other hand, positive ions also reach the ionosphere at such time, with energies of 20–30 kev, suggesting they might be an "overflow" along magnetic field lines of the copious "ring current" ions accelerated at such times, by processes different from the ones described above.some o+ ions ("conics") also seem accelerated in different ways by plasma processes associated with the aurora.
these ions are accelerated by plasma waves in directions mainly perpendicular to the field lines.
they, therefore, start at their "mirror points" and can travel only upward.
as they do so, the "mirror effect" transforms their directions of motion, from perpendicular to the field line to a cone around it, which gradually narrows down, becoming increasingly parallel at large distances where the field is much weaker.
the discovery of a 1770 japanese diary in 2017 depicting auroras above the ancient japanese capital of kyoto suggested that the storm may have been 7% larger than the carrington event, which affected telegraph networks.
the auroras that resulted from the "great geomagnetic storm" on both 28 august and 2 september 1859, however, are thought to be the most spectacular in recent recorded history.
in a paper to the royal society on 21 november 1861, balfour stewart described both auroral events as documented by a self-recording magnetograph at the kew observatory and established the connection between the 2 september 1859 auroral storm and the carrington-hodgson flare event when he observed that "it is not impossible to suppose that in this case our luminary was taken in the act."
the second auroral event, which occurred on 2 september 1859 as a result of the exceptionally intense carrington-hodgson white light solar flare on 1 september 1859, produced auroras, so widespread and extraordinarily bright, that they were seen and reported in published scientific measurements, ship logs, and newspapers throughout the united states, europe, japan, and australia.
it was reported by the new york times that in boston on friday 2 september 1859 the aurora was "so brilliant that at about one o'clock ordinary print could be read by the light".
one o'clock est time on friday 2 september, would have been 6:00 gmt and the self-recording magnetograph at the kew observatory was recording the geomagnetic storm, which was then one hour old, at its full intensity.
between 1859 and 1862, elias loomis published a series of nine papers on the great auroral exhibition of 1859 in the american journal of science where he collected worldwide reports of the auroral event.
that aurora is thought to have been produced by one of the most intense coronal mass ejections in history.
it is also notable for the fact that it is the first time where the phenomena of auroral activity and electricity were unambiguously linked.
this insight was made possible not only due to scientific magnetometer measurements of the era, but also as a result of a significant portion of the 125,000 miles (201,000 km) of telegraph lines then in service being significantly disrupted for many hours throughout the storm.
some telegraph lines, however, seem to have been of the appropriate length and orientation to produce a sufficient geomagnetically induced current from the electromagnetic field to allow for continued communication with the telegraph operator power supplies switched off.
the following conversation occurred between two operators of the american telegraph line between boston and portland, maine, on the night of 2 september 1859 and reported in the boston traveler:
boston operator (to portland operator): "please cut off your battery [power source] entirely for fifteen minutes.
"portland operator: "will do so.
it is now disconnected.
"boston: "mine is disconnected, and we are working with the auroral current.
how do you receive my writing?
"portland: "better than with our batteries on.
– current comes and goes gradually.
"boston: "my current is very strong at times, and we can work better without the batteries, as the aurora seems to neutralize and augment our batteries alternately, making current too strong at times for our relay magnets.
suppose we work without batteries while we are affected by this trouble.
"portland: "very well.
shall i go ahead with business?
"boston: "yes.
go ahead."
the conversation was carried on for around two hours using no battery power at all and working solely with the current induced by the aurora, and it was said that this was the first time on record that more than a word or two was transmitted in such manner.
such events led to the general conclusion that
the effect of the aurorae on the electric telegraph is generally to increase or diminish the electric current generated in working the wires.
sometimes it entirely neutralizes them, so that, in effect, no fluid [current] is discoverable in them.
the aurora borealis seems to be composed of a mass of electric matter, resembling in every respect, that generated by the electric galvanic battery.
the currents from it change coming on the wires, and then disappear the mass of the aurora rolls from the horizon to the zenith.
an aurora was described by the greek explorer pytheas in the 4th century bc.
seneca wrote about auroras in the first book of his naturales quaestiones, classifying them, for instance as pithaei ('barrel-like'); chasmata ('chasm'); pogoniae ('bearded'); cyparissae ('like cypress trees'), and describing their manifold colors.
he wrote about whether they were above or below the clouds, and recalled that under tiberius, an aurora formed above the port city of ostia that was so intense and red that a cohort of the army, stationed nearby for fire duty, galloped to the rescue.
it has been suggested that pliny the elder depicted the aurora borealis in his natural history, when he refers to trabes, chasma, 'falling red flames' and 'daylight in the night'.
in japanese folklore, pheasants were considered messengers from heaven.
however, researchers from japan’s graduate university for advanced studies and national institute of polar research claimed in march 2020 that red pheasant tails witnessed across the night sky over japan in 620 a.d., might be a red aurora produced during a magnetic storm.
in the traditions of aboriginal australians, the aurora australis is commonly associated with fire.
for example, the gunditjmara people of western victoria called auroras puae buae ('ashes'), while the gunai people of eastern victoria perceived auroras as bushfires in the spirit world.
the dieri people of south australia say that an auroral display is kootchee, an evil spirit creating a large fire.
similarly, the ngarrindjeri people of south australia refer to auroras seen over kangaroo island as the campfires of spirits in the 'land of the dead'.
aboriginal people in southwest queensland believe the auroras to be the fires of the oola pikka, ghostly spirits who spoke to the people through auroras.
sacred law forbade anyone except male elders from watching or interpreting the messages of ancestors they believed were transmitted through an aurora.
bulfinch's mythology relates that in norse mythology, the armour of the valkyrior "sheds a strange flickering light, which flashes up over the northern skies, making what men call the 'aurora borealis', or 'northern lights' ".
there appears to be no evidence in old norse literature to substantiate this assertion.
the first old norse account of norðrljós is found in the norwegian chronicle konungs skuggsjá from ad 1230. the chronicler has heard about this phenomenon from compatriots returning from greenland, and he gives three possible explanations: that the ocean was surrounded by vast fires; that the sun flares could reach around the world to its night side; or that glaciers could store energy so that they eventually became fluorescent.
in the 1778, benjamin franklin theorized in his paper aurora borealis, suppositions and conjectures towards forming an hypothesis for its explanation that an aurora was caused by a concentration of electrical charge in the polar regions intensified by the snow and moisture in the air:
may not then the great quantity of electricity brought into the polar regions by the clouds, which are condens'd there, and fall in snow, which electricity would enter the earth, but cannot penetrate the ice; may it not, i say (as a bottle overcharged) break thro' that low atmosphere and run along in the vacuum over the air towards the equator, diverging as the degrees of longitude enlarge, strongly visible where densest, and becoming less visible as it more diverges; till it finds a passage to the earth in more temperate climates, or is mingled with the upper air?
observations of the rhythmic movement of compass needles due to the influence of an aurora were confirmed in the swedish city of uppsala by anders celsius and olof hiorter.
in 1741, hiorter was able to link large magnetic fluctuations with an aurora being observed overhead.
this evidence helped to support their theory that 'magnetic storms' are responsible for such compass fluctuations.
a variety of native american myths surround the spectacle.
the european explorer samuel hearne traveled with chipewyan dene in 1771 and recorded their views on the ed-thin ('caribou').
according to hearne, the dene people saw the resemblance between an aurora and the sparks produced when caribou fur is stroked.
they believed that the lights were the spirits of their departed friends dancing in the sky, and when they shone brightly it meant that their deceased friends were very happy.
during the night after the battle of fredericksburg, an aurora was seen from the battlefield.
the confederate army took this as a sign that god was on their side, as the lights were rarely seen so far south.
the painting aurora borealis by frederic edwin church is widely interpreted to represent the conflict of the american civil war.
a mid 19th-century british source says auroras were a rare occurrence before the 18th-century.
it quotes halley as saying that before the aurora of 1716, no such phenomenon had been recorded for more than 80 years, and none of any consequence since 1574. it says no appearance is recorded in the transactions of the french academy of sciences between 1666 and 1716. and that one aurora recorded in berlin miscellany for 1797 was called a very rare event.
one observed in 1723 at bologna was stated to be the first ever seen there.
celsius (1733) states the oldest residents of uppsala thought the phenomenon a great rarity before 1716. the period between approximately 1645 to 1715 corresponds to the maunder minimum in sunspot activity.
it was the norwegian scientist kristian birkeland who, in the early 1900s, laid the foundation for our current understanding of geomagnetism and polar auroras.
both jupiter and saturn have magnetic fields that are stronger than earth's (jupiter's equatorial field strength is 4.3 gauss, compared to 0.3 gauss for earth), and both have extensive radiation belts.
auroras have been observed on both gas planets, most clearly using the hubble space telescope, and the cassini and galileo spacecraft, as well as on uranus and neptune.
the aurorae on saturn seem, like earth's, to be powered by the solar wind.
however, jupiter's aurorae are more complex.
the jupiter's main auroral oval is associated with the plasma produced by the volcanic moon, io and the transport of this plasma within the planet's magnetosphere.
an uncertain fraction of jupiter's aurorae are powered by the solar wind.
in addition, the moons, especially io, are also powerful sources of aurora.
these arise from electric currents along field lines ("field aligned currents"), generated by a dynamo mechanism due to the relative motion between the rotating planet and the moving moon.
io, which has active volcanism and an ionosphere, is a particularly strong source, and its currents also generate radio emissions, which have been studied since 1955. using the hubble space telescope, auroras over io, europa and ganymede have all been observed.
auroras have also been observed on venus and mars.
venus has no magnetic field and so venusian auroras appear as bright and diffuse patches of varying shape and intensity, sometimes distributed over the full disc of the planet.
a venusian aurora originates when electrons from the solar wind collide with the night-side atmosphere.
an aurora was detected on mars, on 14 august 2004, by the spicam instrument aboard mars express.
the aurora was located at terra cimmeria, in the region of 177° east, 52° south.
the total size of the emission region was about 30 km across, and possibly about 8 km high.
by analyzing a map of crustal magnetic anomalies compiled with data from mars global surveyor, scientists observed that the region of the emissions corresponded to an area where the strongest magnetic field is localized.
this correlation indicated that the origin of the light emission was a flux of electrons moving along the crust magnetic lines and exciting the upper atmosphere of mars.
the first ever extra-solar auroras were discovered in july 2015 over the brown dwarf star lsr j1835+3259.
the mainly red aurora was found to be a million times brighter than the northern lights, a result of the charged particles interacting with hydrogen in the atmosphere.
it has been speculated that stellar winds may be stripping off material from the surface of the brown dwarf to produce its own electrons.
another possible explanation for the auroras is that an as-yet-undetected body around the dwarf star is throwing off material, as is the case with jupiter and its moon io.
luís eduardo magalhães is a municipality in western bahia, brazil.
the town's main business is agriculture, and it is known as the capital of agribusiness.
the city is located in the heart of a rapidly growing agribusiness region and as a result it is the fastest growing city in brazil.
as recently as the 1990s the community was little more than a gas station.
it is currently home to brazil's largest soy processing plant and a big john deere dealership.
because all commercial hauling of all commodities to and from the region is done by diesel trucking, there exists high demand for diesel fuel.
in 2004, the population of luís eduardo magalhães was 21,454. in 2007, the population was 44,265. the strong population growth was caused by the agribusiness.
the city received many farmers from southern and southeastern brazil, contributing to the economic and cultural development of the city.
luís eduardo magalhães has been home to a significant community of young international farmers.
the city is also one of the wealthiest agricultural cities in brazil.most of its development was made via channeling of resources from other areas of the region.
the creation of this municipality was ruled unconstitutional by brazil's supreme court.
it is named after a  deceased member of a powerful oligarchic family, and the city was created solely as a display of power and disdain for the law.
the supreme court was unable to undo its creation, and simply restated that creating new municipalities in the same fashion is deemed unconstitutional.

the "cerrado" landscape is characterized by extensive savanna formations crossed by gallery forests and stream valleys.
cerrado includes various types of vegetation.
humid fields and "buriti" palm paths are found where the water table is near the surface.
alpine pastures occur at higher altitudes and mesophytic forests on more fertile soils.
the "cerrado" trees have characteristic twisted trunks covered by a thick bark, and leaves which are usually broad and rigid.
many herbaceous plants have extensive roots to store water and nutrients.
the plant's thick bark and roots serve as adaptations for the periodic fires which sweep the cerrado landscape.
the adaptations protect the plants from destruction and make them capable of sprouting again after the fire.
the economy of luís eduardo magalhães is focused on agribusiness.
the region is a major producer of cereals (soybeans and corn), coffee, cotton, as well as cattle raising.
irrigation, the level terrain, and the dry climate with well-defined dry and rainy seasons have made luis eduardo magalhaes a leader in agriculture.
farmers and large agricultural companies from all over the world are purchasing large tracts of the region's fertile flat land.
individuals and companies from the usa, canada, china, argentina, india, united kingdom, new zealand, netherlands, germany and ireland are making substantial investments in the region.

josé ferraz de almeida júnior (8 may 1850, itu – 13 november 1899, piracicaba), commonly known as almeida júnior, was a brazilian artist and designer; one of the first there to paint in the realistic tradition of gustave courbet and jean-françois millet.
the "dia do artista plástico" (day of fine artists in brazil) is celebrated on his birthday.
his art career began while he was working as a bell-ringer at the church of "our lady of candelária" and created some small works on religious themes.
the head priest there was sufficiently impressed to hold a fundraiser, so júnior could go to rio de janeiro and take formal art lessons.
in 1869, he enrolled at the academia imperial de belas artes, where he studied with victor meirelles and pedro américo.
his simple, country speech and manners reportedly were the source of much interest and, one might suppose, amusement.
after graduating, he chose not to compete for a travel award to europe, returning instead to itu, and setting up a studio.
he was apparently destined to see europe, however.
in 1876, during a tour of the são paulo region, emperor pedro ii saw júnior's work, was impressed, and personally offered his financial support.
later that year, a royal decree awarded júnior 300 francs per month (usd $60/month) for the purpose of studying in paris.
he soon settled in montmartre and enrolled at the école des beaux-arts, becoming one of the many students of alexandre cabanel.
while there, he participated in four of the salons.
he remained in paris until 1882 then, after a brief trip to italy, returned to brazil and exhibited the works he had created during his absence.
the following year, he opened a studio in são paulo and gave lessons.
he also held exclusive art exhibitions and executed portraits of notable people, ranging from coffee barons to republican politicians.
in 1884, he held a showing at the "exposição geral de belas artes" and was made a knight in the order of the rose
a year later, victor meirelles offered to give júnior his position as professor of history painting at the academy, but júnior refused the offer, preferring to stay in são paulo.
from 1887 to 1896, he made three more trips to europe.
during this period, he would increasingly turn from biblical and historical works in favor of regionalist themes, depicting the everyday life of the "caipiras" and leaving the academic style behind while gradually approaching naturalism.
despite these changes, his reputation at the academy remained unchallenged and he received the gold medal there in 1898.
his life ended tragically a year later when he was stabbed to death in front of the hotel central in piracicaba by his cousin josé de almeida sampaio, who had apparently just learned about júnior's long-standing affair with maria laura do amaral gurgel; sampaio's wife who had briefly been engaged to júnior.

following the world-wide fame of 1st lord baden-powell as a result of the defence and relief of mafeking (1900-1901), many babies were given his name, particularly among un-related powell families, and some adopted the hyphen as well - see for example the middle two of the entries below.
a family tree of that line is on-line.
carlos botelho (18 september 1899, lisbon – 18 august 1982, lisbon) was a portuguese painter, illustrator, comics artist, political cartoonist, satirist and caricaturist , whose works are shown at the chiado museum and at the modern art centre josé de azeredo perdigão / calouste gulbenkian foundation, in lisbon.
botelho was one of the most relevant portuguese artists of his generation.
carlos botelho was an only child to parents who were musicians, and it was music that dominated his childhood.
his father died in 1910.
he attended secondary school at the pedro nunes grammar school, in lisbon, which is where he held his first solo exhibition and befriends bento de jesus caraça and luís ernâni dias amado.
he then enrolls in the lisbon school of fine arts, which he abandons after a short time, then ending his conventional training.
botelho will be an eminently self-taught artist.
he marries beatriz santos botelho in 1922. the marriage bore two children: josé rafael and raquel.
between 1926 and 1929 he regularly drew comic strips for the children’s weekly abczinho, "and is the author of almost the entire front and back pages of each issue, in color".
in 1928, he started a comic page in the weekly publication sempre fixe, a collaboration that he maintained for over 22 years and which was the stage for a caustic criticism of a vast range of issues, going from trivial matters of daily life in lisbon to some of the most relevant events in international life, in a "style that mixed up chronicle, autobiography, journalism, and satire", making it an early example of autobiographical comics.
on 8 december 1950, the date when he ended that monumental cycle of work, his ecos da semana (echoes of the week) made a total of about 1,200 pages, "in a continuous discourse with no intervals or holidays".
"ecos da semana are a double, and triple, diary – of the author, between his 29 and 51 years of age, and of a country, or of a world"; but they are also "a diary of the unsaid".
in a country strangled by censorship, "national politics is excluded from commentary; […] such were the rules of the game" .
this did not stop him, for example, from "confronting the build-up to world war ii, through remarkable, crushing drawings making fun of mussolini and hitler".
in 1929, botelho is a well-known humorist.
that year he left for paris, where he attended the free academies like the grande chaumière; that was the turning point in his career, leading him to definitively opt for painting: "botelho’s first painting of lisbon is from 1929: a view from the cupola of the estrela basilica, geometrically constructed, with a dense matter […], using expressive thickness of paint".
throughout the 1930s, botelho had several stays abroad, working on the portuguese participation in major international exhibitions.
he worked on the portugal pavilion at the international and colonial exhibition of vincennes, paris, 1930–1931, and on the portugal stand at the lyon international fair, 1935. from 1937 on, he was a member, along with bernardo marques and fred kradolfer, of the spn (secretariat for national propaganda) team of decorators charged with producing the portugal pavilions at the exhibition of paris, new york and san francisco: international exhibition of arts and techniques, paris, 1937; 1939 new york world's fair; golden gate international exposition, san francisco, california, 1939.
in 1930, he set up in his studio in the costa do castelo, next to st george’s castle, lisbon, in the house that his wife, a primary education teacher, had a right to due to her position.
the location of the house, where he lived until 1949, no doubt influenced his subject matter, providing him with subjects and references that marked his artistic career.
in 1937, during his stay in paris, he visits a retrospective of the work of van gogh which leaves him "extremely impressed", strengthening the expressive violence of his painting; and he discovers ensor on a brief visit to flanders.
in 1938, he received the amadeo de souza-cardoso prize for the portrait of his father.
in 1939, he won 1st prize at the international contemporary art exposition, san francisco, u.s., which allowed him to buy the land and later build his house-studio in buzano, parede (near to lisbon).
in 1940, he was a member of the decorating team for the portuguese world exhibition, lisbon; and at the 5th modern art exhibition, spn, lisbon, he received the columbano prize.
in 1949, he left the house in the costa do castelo, and he settled in buzano.
from 1955 on, he returned to lisbon to live, now far from the historic centre, in the new neighborhood of areeiro.
in 1969, he retired from his position in the technical services of the sni (national information secretariat), palácio foz, where he had worked since the 1940s.
"for botelho the thirties are a thrilling decade full of extremely dense production", and his painting is formally characterized by a strong connection to expressionism.
within it one can detect three different strands of subject matter:
firstly, the urban landscape of the city in which he was born and lived.
lisbon soon stands out as the "predominant iconography, even the body of the deepening of the painter’s recourses and of their successive poetics".
it is not, however, the almost single path we find in his later work: "landscape is enunciated […] as a possibility in this recently-started career, but it is not yet the imperative matrix of the future".
botelho will also paint other cities: paris, florence, amsterdam, new orleans and, above all, new york: "in terms of portuguese art at the end of the […] nineteen thirties, these paintings are located at the vanguard of everything that was being done at the time".
alongside the urban landscapes, and "intending to free himself from the strict appreciation that had consecrated him as a humorist", botelho turned his attention to the social realm in works that thematically and stylistically bring him close to the "expressionist painting of the northern european tradition, enunciating a sense of research that could be connoted to van gogh’s dutch period".
his acrobats, his blind men and fishermen are solid and dense figures, showing us another facet of his work.
the third path that will occupy him throughout the initial decade is the portrait, which will culminate in the portraits of beatriz, his parents and his children.
and if the portrait of botelho’s father, from 1937, is "an axial moment in his work", the portraits of his children are the final step in the autonomization of his approach: "no concession to the conventional taste in these two portraits, no sentimentality for the models, but rather a brusqueness of gesture and of attitude, as if his intimate relationship with them in no way affected his desire for painting".
from the 1930s onwards, botelho’s lisbon becomes an intensely personal realm, capable of revealing something profound, granting us "the view of an archetypical city whose beauty is the mediating form of the truth of a people or of its specific anthropology […].
with a great simplicity of processes and effects, [botelho] created a plastic universe as the symbolic and imaginative mirror of one of the most significant facets of the portuguese spirit".
he records the city, "but, more deeply, he invents it, shifting the accidents and the places, subjecting them to a plastic demand.
yet we deeply acknowledge that this “painted” city is as real, or more real (?
), than the existing one".
his painting will subtly change.
the softening of the expressionist intensity opens up paths to a different poetic dimension and to a new awareness of the canvas’ flatness.
in the 1950s that option becomes radicalized: "botelho starts out from modernist principles, like the autonomy of the line [or] the rejection of renaissance perspective”, in “different” works in which he more than ever comes close to abstraction.
the formal principles he investigates in these works will reappear shortly after under a different guise in the formal structuring of the urban landscapes that occupy him until the end: "the last productive clash came with the affirmation of abstractionism in the 1950s, via the paris school and vieira da silva, and this was decisive for the cycles of his long final production: he did not cut off the metaphorical body of lisbon [...] but disciplined it in rhymes and chromatic spatialities in which light is the determining referent.
botelho exhibited his work in numerous solo and group exhibitions, among which one may highlight: 25th venice biennial, 1950; 1st sao paulo biennial, 1951; 3rd sao paulo biennial, são paulo, brazil, 1955; 4th sao paulo biennial, 1957; 1st exhibition of fine arts, calouste gulbenkian foundation, lisbon, 1957; 50 years of modern art, brussels, 1958; 30th venice biennial; 2nd exhibition of fine arts, calouste gulbenkian foundation, lisbon, 1961; 8th sao paulo biennial, 1965; etc.
he is represented in many public and private collections, such as: lisbon city council (câmara municipal de lisboa); chiado museum, lisbon; modern art centre josé de azeredo perdigão, calouste gulbenkian foundation, lisbon; sao paulo museum of modern art, são paulo, brazil; etc.

frédéric françois chopin (uk: /ˈʃɒpæ̃/, us: /ʃoʊˈpæn/, french: [ʃɔpɛ̃], polish: [ˈʂɔpɛn]; 1 march 1810 – 17 october 1849) was a polish composer and virtuoso pianist of the romantic era who wrote primarily for solo piano.
he has maintained worldwide renown as a leading musician of his era, one whose "poetic genius was based on a professional technique that was without equal in his generation."
chopin was born fryderyk franciszek chopin in the duchy of warsaw and grew up in warsaw, which in 1815 became part of congress poland.
a child prodigy, he completed his musical education and composed his earlier works in warsaw before leaving poland at the age of 20, less than a month before the outbreak of the november 1830 uprising.
at 21, he settled in paris.
thereafter—in the last 18 years of his life—he gave only 30 public performances, preferring the more intimate atmosphere of the salon.
he supported himself by selling his compositions and by giving piano lessons, for which he was in high demand.
chopin formed a friendship with franz liszt and was admired by many of his other musical contemporaries (including robert schumann).
after a failed engagement to maria wodzińska from 1836 to 1837, he maintained an often troubled relationship with the french writer amantine dupin (known by her pen name, george sand).
a brief and unhappy visit to majorca with sand in 1838–39 would prove one of his most productive periods of composition.
in his final years, he was supported financially by his admirer jane stirling, who also arranged for him to visit scotland in 1848. for most of his life, chopin was in poor health.
he died in paris in 1849 at the age of 39, probably of pericarditis aggravated by tuberculosis.
all of chopin's compositions include the piano.
most are for solo piano, though he also wrote two piano concertos, a few chamber pieces, and some 19 songs set to polish lyrics.
his piano writing was technically demanding and expanded the limits of the instrument: his own performances were noted for their nuance and sensitivity.
chopin invented the concept of the instrumental ballade.
his major piano works also include mazurkas, waltzes, nocturnes, polonaises, études, impromptus, scherzos, preludes and sonatas, some published only posthumously.
among the influences on his style of composition were polish folk music, the classical tradition of j. s. bach, mozart, and schubert, and the atmosphere of the paris salons of which he was a frequent guest.
his innovations in style, harmony, and musical form, and his association of music with nationalism, were influential throughout and after the late romantic period.
chopin's music, his status as one of music's earliest superstars, his (indirect) association with political insurrection, his high-profile love-life, and his early death have made him a leading symbol of the romantic era.
his works remain popular, and he has been the subject of numerous films and biographies of varying historical fidelity.
fryderyk chopin was born in żelazowa wola, 46 kilometres (29 miles) west of warsaw, in what was then the duchy of warsaw, a polish state established by napoleon.
the parish baptismal record gives his birthday as 22 february 1810, and cites his given names in the latin form fridericus franciscus (in polish, he was fryderyk franciszek).
however, the composer and his family used the birthdate 1 march,[n 1] which is now generally accepted as the correct date.
fryderyk's father, nicolas chopin, was a frenchman from lorraine who had emigrated to poland in 1787 at the age of sixteen.
nicolas tutored children of the polish aristocracy, and in 1806 married tekla justyna krzyżanowska, a poor relative of the skarbeks, one of the families for whom he worked.
fryderyk was baptised on easter sunday, 23 april 1810, in the same church where his parents had married, in brochów.
his eighteen-year-old godfather, for whom he was named, was fryderyk skarbek, a pupil of nicolas chopin.
fryderyk was the couple's second child and only son; he had an elder sister, ludwika (1807–1855), and two younger sisters, izabela (1811–1881) and emilia (1812–1827).
nicolas was devoted to his adopted homeland, and insisted on the use of the polish language in the household.
in october 1810, six months after fryderyk's birth, the family moved to warsaw, where his father acquired a post teaching french at the warsaw lyceum, then housed in the saxon palace.
fryderyk lived with his family in the palace grounds.
the father played the flute and violin; the mother played the piano and gave lessons to boys in the boarding house that the chopins kept.
chopin was of slight build, and even in early childhood was prone to illnesses.
fryderyk may have had some piano instruction from his mother, but his first professional music tutor, from 1816 to 1821, was the czech pianist wojciech żywny.
his elder sister ludwika also took lessons from żywny, and occasionally played duets with her brother.
it quickly became apparent that he was a child prodigy.
by the age of seven fryderyk had begun giving public concerts, and in 1817 he composed two polonaises, in g minor and b-flat major.
his next work, a polonaise in a-flat major of 1821, dedicated to żywny, is his earliest surviving musical manuscript.
in 1817 the saxon palace was requisitioned by warsaw's russian governor for military use, and the warsaw lyceum was reestablished in the kazimierz palace (today the rectorate of warsaw university).
fryderyk and his family moved to a building, which still survives, adjacent to the kazimierz palace.
during this period, fryderyk was sometimes invited to the belweder palace as playmate to the son of the ruler of russian poland, grand duke constantine pavlovich of russia; he played the piano for constantine pavlovich and composed a march for him.
julian ursyn niemcewicz, in his dramatic eclogue, "nasze przebiegi" ("our discourses", 1818), attested to "little chopin's" popularity.
from september 1823 to 1826, chopin attended the warsaw lyceum, where he received organ lessons from the czech musician wilhelm würfel during his first year.
in the autumn of 1826 he began a three-year course under the silesian composer józef elsner at the warsaw conservatory, studying music theory, figured bass, and composition.
[n 2] throughout this period he continued to compose and to give recitals in concerts and salons in warsaw.
he was engaged by the inventors of the "aeolomelodicon" (a combination of piano and mechanical organ), and on this instrument, in may 1825 he performed his own improvisation and part of a concerto by moscheles.
the success of this concert led to an invitation to give a recital on a similar instrument (the "aeolopantaleon") before tsar alexander i, who was visiting warsaw; the tsar presented him with a diamond ring.
at a subsequent aeolopantaleon concert on 10 june 1825, chopin performed his rondo op.
1. this was the first of his works to be commercially published and earned him his first mention in the foreign press, when the leipzig allgemeine musikalische zeitung praised his "wealth of musical ideas".
during 1824–28 chopin spent his vacations away from warsaw, at a number of locales.
[n 3] in 1824 and 1825, at szafarnia, he was a guest of dominik dziewanowski, the father of a schoolmate.
here for the first time, he encountered polish rural folk music.
his letters home from szafarnia (to which he gave the title "the szafarnia courier"), written in a very modern and lively polish, amused his family with their spoofing of the warsaw newspapers and demonstrated the youngster's literary gift.
in 1827, soon after the death of chopin's youngest sister emilia, the family moved from the warsaw university building, adjacent to the kazimierz palace, to lodgings just across the street from the university, in the south annexe of the krasiński palace on krakowskie przedmieście,[n 4] where chopin lived until he left warsaw in 1830.
[n 5]  here his parents continued running their boarding house for male students; the chopin family parlour (salonik chopinów) became a  museum in the 20th century.
in 1829 the artist ambroży mieroszewski executed a set of portraits of chopin family members, including the first known portrait of the composer.
[n 6]
four boarders at his parents' apartments became chopin's intimates: tytus woyciechowski, jan nepomucen białobłocki, jan matuszyński and julian fontana; the latter two would become part of his paris milieu.
he was friendly with members of warsaw's young artistic and intellectual world, including fontana, józef bohdan zaleski and stefan witwicki.
he was also attracted to the singing student konstancja gładkowska.
in letters to woyciechowski, he indicated which of his works, and even which of their passages, were influenced by his fascination with her; his letter of 15 may 1830 revealed that the slow movement (larghetto) of his piano concerto no.
1 (in e minor) was secretly dedicated to her – "it should be like dreaming in beautiful springtime – by moonlight."
his final conservatory report (july 1829) read:  "chopin f., third-year student, exceptional talent, musical genius."
in september 1828 chopin, while still a student, visited berlin with a family friend, zoologist feliks jarocki, enjoying operas directed by gaspare spontini and attending concerts by carl friedrich zelter, felix mendelssohn and other celebrities.
on an 1829 return trip to berlin, he was a guest of prince antoni radziwiłł, governor of the grand duchy of posen—himself an accomplished composer and aspiring cellist.
for the prince and his pianist daughter wanda, he composed his introduction and polonaise brillante in c major for cello and piano, op.
3.
back in warsaw that year, chopin heard niccolò paganini play the violin, and composed a set of variations, souvenir de paganini.
it may have been this experience which encouraged him to commence writing his first études (1829–32), exploring the capacities of his own instrument.
on 11 august, three weeks after completing his studies at the warsaw conservatory, he made his debut in vienna.
he gave two piano concerts and received many favourable reviews—in addition to some commenting (in chopin's own words) that he was "too delicate for those accustomed to the piano-bashing of local artists".
in one of these concerts, he premiered his variations on là ci darem la mano, op.
2 (variations on a duet from mozart's opera don giovanni) for piano and orchestra.
he returned to warsaw in september 1829, where he premiered his piano concerto no.
2 in f minor, op.
21 on 17 march 1830.
chopin's successes as a composer and performer opened the door to western europe for him, and on 2 november 1830, he set out, in the words of zdzisław jachimecki, "into the wide world, with no very clearly defined aim, forever."
with woyciechowski, he headed for austria again, intending to go on to italy.
later that month, in warsaw, the november 1830 uprising broke out, and woyciechowski returned to poland to enlist.
chopin, now alone in vienna, was nostalgic for his homeland, and wrote to a friend, "i curse the moment of my departure."
when in september 1831 he learned, while travelling from vienna to paris, that the uprising had been crushed, he expressed his anguish in the pages of his private journal: "oh god!
... you are there, and yet you do not take vengeance!"
jachimecki ascribes to these events the composer's maturing "into an inspired national bard who intuited the past, present and future of his native poland."
when he left warsaw in late 1830, chopin had intended to go to italy, but violent unrest there made that a dangerous destination.
his next choice was paris; difficulties obtaining a visa from russian authorities resulted in him getting transit permission from the french.
in later years he would quote the passport's endorsement passeport en passant par paris à londres ("in transit to london via paris"), joking that he was in the city "only in passing."
chopin arrived in paris in late september 1831; he would never return to poland, thus becoming one of many expatriates of the polish great emigration.
in france, he used the french versions of his given names, and after receiving french citizenship in 1835, he travelled on a french passport.
however, chopin remained close to his fellow poles in exile as friends and confidants and he never felt fully comfortable speaking french.
chopin's biographer adam zamoyski writes that he never considered himself to be french, despite his father's french origins, and always saw himself as a pole.
in paris, chopin encountered artists and other distinguished figures and found many opportunities to exercise his talents and achieve celebrity.
during his years in paris, he was to become acquainted with, among many others, hector berlioz, franz liszt, ferdinand hiller, heinrich heine, eugène delacroix, and alfred de vigny.
chopin was also acquainted with the poet adam mickiewicz, principal of the polish literary society, some of whose verses he set as songs.
two polish friends in paris were also to play important roles in chopin's life there.
his fellow student at the warsaw conservatory, julian fontana, had originally tried unsuccessfully to establish himself in england; fontana was to become, in the words of michałowski and samson, chopin's "general factotum and copyist".
albert grzymała, who in paris became a wealthy financier and society figure, often acted as chopin's adviser and "gradually began to fill the role of elder brother in [his] life."
at the end of 1831, chopin received the first major endorsement from an outstanding contemporary when robert schumann, reviewing the op.
2 variations in the allgemeine musikalische zeitung (his first published article on music), declared: "hats off, gentlemen!
a genius."
on 25 february 1832 chopin gave a debut paris concert in the "salons de mm pleyel“ 9 rue cadet  which drew universal admiration.
the critic françois-joseph fétis wrote in the revue et gazette musicale: "here is a young man who ... taking no model, has found, if not a complete renewal of piano music, ... an abundance of original ideas of a kind to be found nowhere else ..." after this concert, chopin realised that his essentially intimate keyboard technique was not optimal for large concert spaces.
later that year he was introduced to the wealthy rothschild banking family, whose patronage also opened doors for him to other private salons (social gatherings of the aristocracy and artistic and literary elite).
by the end of 1832 chopin had established himself among the parisian musical elite and had earned the respect of his peers such as hiller, liszt, and berlioz.
he no longer depended financially upon his father, and in the winter of 1832, he began earning a handsome income from publishing his works and teaching piano to affluent students from all over europe.
this freed him from the strains of public concert-giving, which he disliked.
chopin seldom performed publicly in paris.
in later years he generally gave a single annual concert at the salle pleyel, a venue that seated three hundred.
he played more frequently at salons but preferred playing at his own paris apartment for small groups of friends.
the musicologist arthur hedley has observed that "as a pianist chopin was unique in acquiring a reputation of the highest order on the basis of a minimum of public appearances—few more than thirty in the course of his lifetime."
the list of musicians who took part in some of his concerts indicates the richness of parisian artistic life during this period.
examples include a concert on 23 march 1833, in which chopin, liszt, and hiller performed (on pianos) a concerto by j.s.
bach for three keyboards; and, on 3 march 1838, a concert in which chopin, his pupil adolphe gutmann, charles-valentin alkan, and alkan's teacher joseph zimmermann performed alkan's arrangement, for eight hands, of two movements from beethoven's 7th symphony.
chopin was also involved in the composition of liszt's hexameron; he wrote the sixth (and final) variation on bellini's theme.
chopin's music soon found success with publishers, and in 1833 he contracted with maurice schlesinger, who arranged for it to be published not only in france but, through his family connections, also in germany and england.
in the spring of 1834, chopin attended the lower rhenish music festival in aix-la-chapelle with hiller, and it was there that chopin met felix mendelssohn.
after the festival, the three visited düsseldorf, where mendelssohn had been appointed musical director.
they spent what mendelssohn described as "a very agreeable day", playing and discussing music at his piano, and met friedrich wilhelm schadow, director of the academy of art, and some of his eminent pupils such as lessing, bendemann, hildebrandt and sohn.
in 1835 chopin went to carlsbad, where he spent time with his parents; it was the last time he would see them.
on his way back to paris, he met old friends from warsaw, the wodzińskis.
he had made the acquaintance of their daughter maria in poland five years earlier when she was eleven.
this meeting prompted him to stay for two weeks in dresden, when he had previously intended to return to paris via leipzig.
the sixteen-year-old girl's portrait of the composer is considered, along with delacroix's, as among chopin's best likenesses.
in october he finally reached leipzig, where he met schumann, clara wieck and mendelssohn, who organised for him a performance of his own oratorio st. paul, and who considered him "a perfect musician".
in july 1836 chopin travelled to marienbad and dresden to be with the wodziński family, and in september he proposed to maria, whose mother countess wodzińska approved in principle.
chopin went on to leipzig, where he presented schumann with his g minor ballade.
at the end of 1836, he sent maria an album in which his sister ludwika had inscribed seven of his songs, and his 1835 nocturne in c-sharp minor, op.
27, no.
1. the anodyne thanks he received from maria proved to be the last letter he was to have from her.
although it is not known exactly when chopin first met franz liszt after arriving in paris, on 12 december 1831 he mentioned in a letter to his friend woyciechowski that "i have met rossini, cherubini, baillot, etc.—also kalkbrenner.
you would not believe how curious i was about herz, liszt, hiller, etc."
liszt was in attendance at chopin's parisian debut on 26 february 1832 at the salle pleyel, which led him to remark: "the most vigorous applause seemed not to suffice to our enthusiasm in the presence of this talented musician, who revealed a new phase of poetic sentiment combined with such happy innovation in the form of his art."
the two became friends, and for many years lived close to each other in paris, chopin at 38 rue de la chaussée-d'antin, and liszt at the hôtel de france on the rue lafitte, a few blocks away.
they performed together on seven occasions between 1833 and 1841. the first, on 2 april 1833, was at a benefit concert organised by hector berlioz for his bankrupt shakespearean actress wife harriet smithson, during which they played george onslow's sonata in f minor for piano duet.
later joint appearances included a benefit concert for the benevolent association of polish ladies in paris.
their last appearance together in public was for a charity concert conducted for the beethoven monument in bonn, held at the salle pleyel and the paris conservatory on 25 and 26 april 1841.
although the two displayed great respect and admiration for each other, their friendship was uneasy and had some qualities of a love-hate relationship.
harold c. schonberg believes that chopin displayed a "tinge of jealousy and spite" towards liszt's virtuosity on the piano, and others have also argued that he had become enchanted with liszt's theatricality, showmanship and success.
liszt was the dedicatee of chopin's op.
10 études, and his performance of them  prompted the composer to write to hiller, "i should like to rob him of the way he plays my studies."
however, chopin expressed annoyance in 1843 when liszt performed one of his nocturnes with the addition of numerous intricate embellishments, at which chopin remarked that he should play the music as written or not play it at all, forcing an apology.
most biographers of chopin state that after this the two had little to do with each other, although in his letters dated as late as 1848 he still referred to him as "my friend liszt".
some commentators point to events in the two men's romantic lives which led to a rift between them; there are claims that liszt had displayed jealousy of his mistress marie d'agoult's obsession with chopin, while others believe that chopin had become concerned about liszt's growing relationship with george sand.
in 1836, at a party hosted by marie d'agoult, chopin met the french author george sand (born [amantine] aurore [lucile] dupin).
short (under five feet, or 152 cm), dark, big-eyed and a cigar smoker, she initially repelled chopin, who remarked, "what an unattractive person la sand is.
is she really a woman?"
however, by early 1837 maria wodzińska's mother had made it clear to chopin in correspondence that a marriage with her daughter was unlikely to proceed.
it is thought that she was influenced by his poor health and possibly also by rumours about his associations with women such as d'agoult and sand.
chopin finally placed the letters from maria and her mother in a package on which he wrote, in polish, "my tragedy".
sand, in a letter to grzymała of june 1838, admitted strong feelings for the composer and debated whether to abandon a current affair in order to begin a relationship with chopin; she asked grzymała to assess chopin's relationship with maria wodzińska, without realising that the affair, at least from maria's side, was over.
in june 1837 chopin visited london incognito in the company of the piano manufacturer camille pleyel where he played at a musical soirée at the house of english piano maker james broadwood.
on his return to paris, his association with sand began in earnest and by the end of june 1838 they had become lovers.
sand, who was six years older than the composer, and who had had a series of lovers, wrote at this time: "i must say i was confused and amazed at the effect this little creature had on me ... i have still not recovered from my astonishment, and if i were a proud person i should be feeling humiliated at having been carried away ..." the two spent a miserable winter on majorca (8 november 1838 to 13 february 1839), where, together with sand's two children, they had journeyed in the hope of improving the health of chopin and that of sand's 15-year-old son maurice, and also to escape the threats of sand's former lover félicien mallefille.
after discovering that the couple were not married, the deeply traditional catholic people of majorca became inhospitable, making accommodation difficult to find.
this compelled the group to take lodgings in a former carthusian monastery in valldemossa, which gave little shelter from the cold winter weather.
on 3 december 1838, chopin complained about his bad health and the incompetence of the doctors in majorca: "three doctors have visited me ... the first said i was dead; the second said i was dying; and the third said i was about to die."
he also had problems having his pleyel piano sent to him, having to rely in the meantime on a piano made in palma by juan bauza.
[n 7] the pleyel piano finally arrived from paris in december, just shortly before chopin and sand left the island.
chopin wrote to pleyel in january 1839: "i am sending you my preludes [(op.
28)].
i finished them on your little piano, which arrived in the best possible condition in spite of the sea, the bad weather and the palma customs."
chopin was also able to undertake work while in majorca on his ballade no.
2, op.
38; two polonaises, op.
40; and the scherzo no.
3, op.
39.
although this period had been productive, the bad weather had such a detrimental effect on chopin's health that sand determined to leave the island.
to avoid further customs duties, sand sold the piano to a local french couple, the canuts.
[n 8] the group travelled first to barcelona, then to marseilles, where they stayed for a few months while chopin convalesced.
while in marseilles chopin made a rare appearance at the organ during a requiem mass for the tenor adolphe nourrit on 24 april 1839, playing a transcription of franz schubert's lied die gestirne (d.
444).
[n 9] in may 1839 they headed for the summer to sand's estate at nohant, where they spent most summers until 1846. in autumn they returned to paris, where chopin's apartment at 5 rue tronchet was close to sand's rented accommodation at the rue pigalle.
he frequently visited sand in the evenings, but both retained some independence.
in 1842 he and sand moved to the square d'orléans, living in adjacent buildings.
on 26 july 1840 chopin and sand were present at the dress rehearsal of berlioz's grande symphonie funèbre et triomphale, composed to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the july revolution.
chopin was reportedly unimpressed with the composition.
during the summers at nohant, particularly in the years 1839–43, chopin found quiet, productive days during which he composed many works, including his polonaise in a-flat major, op.
53. among the visitors to nohant were delacroix and the mezzo-soprano pauline viardot, whom chopin had advised on piano technique and composition.
delacroix gives an account of staying at nohant in a letter of 7 june 1842:
the hosts could not be more pleasant in entertaining me.
when we are not all together at dinner, lunch, playing billiards, or walking, each of us stays in his room, reading or lounging around on a couch.
sometimes, through the window which opens on the garden, a gust of music wafts up from chopin at work.
all this mingles with the songs of nightingales and the fragrance of roses.
from 1842 onwards, chopin showed signs of serious illness.
after a solo recital in paris on 21 february 1842, he wrote to grzymała:  "i have to lie in bed all day long, my mouth and tonsils are aching so much."
he was forced by illness to decline a written invitation from alkan to participate in a repeat performance of the beethoven seventh symphony arrangement at érard's on 1 march 1843. late in 1844, charles hallé visited chopin and found him "hardly able to move, bent like a half-opened penknife and evidently in great pain", although his spirits returned when he started to play the piano for his visitor.
chopin's health continued to deteriorate, particularly from this time onwards.
modern research suggests that apart from any other illnesses, he may also have suffered from temporal lobe epilepsy.
chopin's relations with sand were soured in 1846 by problems involving her daughter solange and solange's fiancé, the young fortune-hunting sculptor auguste clésinger.
the composer frequently took solange's side in quarrels with her mother; he also faced jealousy from sand's son maurice.
chopin was utterly indifferent to sand's radical political  pursuits, while sand looked on his society friends with disdain.
as the composer's illness progressed, sand had become less of a lover and more of a nurse to chopin, whom she called her "third child".
in letters to third parties, she vented her impatience, referring to him as a "child," a "little angel", a "sufferer" and a "beloved little corpse."
in 1847 sand published her novel lucrezia floriani, whose main characters—a rich actress and a prince in weak health—could be interpreted as sand and chopin; the story was uncomplimentary to chopin, who could not have missed the allusions as he helped sand correct the printer's galleys.
in 1847 he did not visit nohant, and he quietly ended their ten-year relationship following an angry correspondence which, in sand's words, made "a strange conclusion to nine years of exclusive friendship."
the two would never meet again.
chopin's output as a composer throughout this period declined in quantity year by year.
whereas in 1841 he had written a dozen works, only six were written in 1842 and six shorter pieces in 1843. in 1844 he wrote only the op.
58 sonata.
1845 saw the completion of three mazurkas (op.
59).
although these works were more refined than many of his earlier compositions, zamoyski concludes that "his powers of concentration were failing and his inspiration was beset by anguish, both emotional and intellectual."
chopin's public popularity as a virtuoso began to wane, as did the number of his pupils, and this, together with the political strife and instability of the time, caused him to struggle financially.
in february 1848, with the cellist auguste franchomme, he gave his last paris concert, which included three movements of the cello sonata op.
65.
in april, during the revolution of 1848 in paris, he left for london, where he performed at several concerts and numerous receptions in great houses.
this tour was suggested to him by his scottish pupil jane stirling and her elder sister.
stirling also made all the logistical arrangements and provided much of the necessary funding.
in london, chopin took lodgings at dover street, where the firm of broadwood provided him with a grand piano.
at his first engagement, on 15 may at stafford house, the audience included queen victoria and prince albert.
the prince, who was himself a talented musician, moved close to the keyboard to view chopin's technique.
broadwood also arranged concerts for him; among those attending were thackeray and the singer jenny lind.
chopin was also sought after for piano lessons, for which he charged the high fee of one guinea per hour, and for private recitals for which the fee was 20 guineas.
at a concert on 7 july, he shared the platform with viardot, who sang arrangements of some of his mazurkas to spanish texts.
on 28 august, he played at a concert in manchester's concert hall, sharing the stage with marietta alboni and lorenzo salvi.
in late summer he was invited by jane stirling to visit scotland, where he stayed at calder house near edinburgh and at johnstone castle in renfrewshire, both owned by members of stirling's family.
she clearly had a notion of going beyond mere friendship, and chopin was obliged to make it clear to her that this could not be so.
he wrote at this time to grzymała "my scottish ladies are kind, but such bores", and responding to a rumour about his involvement, answered that he was "closer to the grave than the nuptial bed."
he gave a public concert in glasgow on 27 september, and another in edinburgh, at the hopetoun rooms on queen street (now erskine house) on 4 october.
in late october 1848, while staying at 10 warriston crescent in edinburgh with the polish physician adam łyszczyński, he wrote out his last will and testament—"a kind of disposition to be made of my stuff in the future, if i should drop dead somewhere", he wrote to grzymała.
chopin made his last public appearance on a concert platform at london's guildhall on 16 november 1848, when, in a final patriotic gesture, he played for the benefit of polish refugees.
by this time he was very seriously ill, weighing under 99 pounds (i.e.
less than 45 kg), and his doctors were aware that his sickness was at a terminal stage.
at the end of november, chopin returned to paris.
he passed the winter in unremitting illness, but gave occasional lessons and was visited by friends, including delacroix and franchomme.
occasionally he played, or accompanied the singing of delfina potocka, for his friends.
during the summer of 1849, his friends found him an apartment in chaillot, out of the centre of the city, for which the rent was secretly subsidised by an admirer, princess obreskoff.
here in june 1849, he was visited by jenny lind.
with his health further deteriorating, chopin desired to have a family member with him.
in june 1849 his sister ludwika came to paris with her husband and daughter, and in september, supported by a loan from jane stirling, he took an apartment at place vendôme 12. after 15 october, when his condition took a marked turn for the worse, only a handful of his closest friends remained with him, although viardot remarked sardonically that "all the grand parisian ladies considered it de rigueur to faint in his room."
some of his friends provided music at his request; among them, potocka sang and franchomme played the cello.
chopin bequeathed his unfinished notes on a piano tuition method, projet de méthode, to alkan for completion.
on 17 october, after midnight, the physician leaned over him and asked whether he was suffering greatly.
"no longer", he replied.
he died a few minutes before two o'clock in the morning.
he was 39. those present at the deathbed appear to have included his sister ludwika, princess marcelina czartoryska, sand's daughter solange, and his close friend thomas albrecht.
later that morning, solange's husband clésinger made chopin's death mask and a cast of his left hand.
the funeral, held at the church of the madeleine in paris, was delayed almost two weeks, until 30 october.
entrance was restricted to ticket holders as many people were expected to attend.
over 3,000 people arrived without invitations, from as far as london, berlin and vienna, and were excluded.
mozart's requiem was sung at the funeral; the soloists were the soprano jeanne-anaïs castellan, the mezzo-soprano pauline viardot, the tenor alexis dupont, and the bass luigi lablache; chopin's preludes no.
4 in e minor and no.
6 in b minor were also played.
the organist at the funeral was louis lefébure-wély.
the funeral procession to père lachaise cemetery, which included chopin's sister ludwika, was led by the aged prince adam czartoryski.
the pallbearers included delacroix, franchomme, and camille pleyel.
at the graveside, the funeral march from chopin's piano sonata no.
2 was played, in reber's instrumentation.
chopin's tombstone, featuring the muse of music, euterpe, weeping over a broken lyre, was designed and sculpted by clésinger.
the expenses of the funeral and monument, amounting to 5,000 francs, were covered by jane stirling, who also paid for the return of the composer's sister ludwika to warsaw.
as requested by chopin, ludwika took his heart (which had been removed by his doctor jean cruveilhier and preserved in alcohol in a vase), back to poland in 1850.
[n 10] she also took a collection of two hundred letters from sand to chopin; after 1851 these were returned to sand, who destroyed them.
chopin's disease and the cause of his death have been a matter of discussion.
his death certificate gave the cause of death as tuberculosis, and his physician,  cruveilhier, was then the leading french authority on this disease.
other possibilities that have been advanced have included cystic fibrosis, cirrhosis, and alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency.
a visual examination of chopin's preserved heart (the jar was not opened), conducted in 2014 and first published in the american journal of medicine in 2017, suggested that the likely cause of his death was a rare case of pericarditis caused by complications of chronic tuberculosis.
over 230 works of chopin survive; some compositions from early childhood have been lost.
all his known works involve the piano, and only a few range beyond solo piano music, as either piano concertos, songs or chamber music.
chopin was educated in the tradition of beethoven, haydn, mozart and clementi; he used clementi's piano method with his own students.
he was also influenced by hummel's development of virtuoso, yet mozartian, piano technique.
he cited bach and mozart as the two most important composers in shaping his musical outlook.
chopin's early works are in the style of the "brilliant" keyboard pieces of his era as exemplified by the works of ignaz moscheles, friedrich kalkbrenner, and others.
less direct in the earlier period are the influences of polish folk music and of italian opera.
much of what became his typical style of ornamentation (for example, his fioriture) is taken from singing.
his melodic lines were increasingly reminiscent of the modes and features of the music of his native country, such as drones.
chopin took the new salon genre of the nocturne, invented by the irish composer john field, to a deeper level of sophistication.
he was the first to write ballades and scherzi as individual concert pieces.
he essentially established a new genre with his own set of free-standing preludes (op.
28, published 1839).
he exploited the poetic potential of the concept of the concert étude, already being developed in the 1820s and 1830s by liszt, clementi, and moscheles, in his two sets of studies (op.
10 published in 1833, op.
25 in 1837).
chopin also endowed popular dance forms with a greater range of melody and expression.
chopin's mazurkas, while originating in the traditional polish dance (the mazurek), differed from the traditional variety in that they were written for the concert hall rather than the dance hall; as j. barrie jones puts it, "it was chopin who put the mazurka on the european musical map."
the series of seven polonaises published in his lifetime (another nine were published posthumously), beginning with the op.
26 pair (published 1836), set a new standard for music in the form.
his waltzes were also written specifically for the salon recital rather than the ballroom and are frequently at rather faster tempos than their dance-floor equivalents.
some of chopin's well-known pieces have acquired descriptive titles, such as the revolutionary étude (op.
10, no.
12), and the minute waltz (op.
64, no.
1).
however, except for his funeral march, the composer never named an instrumental work beyond genre and number, leaving all potential extramusical associations to the listener; the names by which many of his pieces are known were invented by others.
there is no evidence to suggest that the revolutionary étude was written with the failed polish uprising against russia in mind; it merely appeared at that time.
the funeral march, the third movement of his sonata no.
2 (op.
35), the one case where he did give a title, was written before the rest of the sonata, but no specific event or death is known to have inspired it.
the last opus number that chopin himself used was 65, allocated to the cello sonata in g minor.
he expressed a deathbed wish that all his unpublished manuscripts be destroyed.
at the request of the composer's mother and sisters, however, his musical executor julian fontana selected 23 unpublished piano pieces and grouped them into eight further opus numbers (opp.
66–73), published in 1855. in 1857, 17 polish songs that chopin wrote at various stages of his life were collected and published as op.
74, though their order within the opus did not reflect the order of composition.
works published since 1857 have received alternative catalogue designations instead of opus numbers.
the present standard musicological reference for chopin's works is the kobylańska catalogue (usually represented by the initials 'kk'), named for its compiler, the polish musicologist krystyna kobylańska.
chopin's original publishers included maurice schlesinger and camille pleyel.
his works soon began to appear in popular 19th-century piano anthologies.
the first collected edition was by breitkopf & härtel (1878–1902).
among modern scholarly editions of chopin's works are the version under the name of paderewski published between 1937 and 1966 and the more recent polish "national edition", edited by jan ekier, both of which contain detailed explanations and discussions regarding choices and sources.
chopin published his music in france, england and the german states due to the copyright laws of the time.
as such there are often three different kinds of ‘first editions’.
each edition is different from the other, as chopin edited them separately and at times he did some revision to the music while editing it.
furthermore, chopin provided his publishers with varying sources, including autographs, annotated proofsheets, and scribal copies.
only recently have these differences gained greater recognition.
improvisation stands at the centre of chopin's creative processes.
however, this does not imply impulsive rambling: nicholas temperley writes that "improvisation is designed for an audience, and its starting-point is that audience's expectations, which include the current conventions of musical form."
the works for piano and orchestra, including the two concertos, are held by temperley to be "merely vehicles for brilliant piano playing ... formally longwinded and extremely conservative".
after the piano concertos (which are both early, dating from 1830), chopin made no attempts at large-scale multi-movement forms, save for his late sonatas for piano and cello; "instead he achieved near-perfection in pieces of simple general design but subtle and complex cell-structure."
rosen suggests that an important aspect of chopin's individuality is his flexible handling of the four-bar phrase as a structural unit.
j. barrie jones suggests that "amongst the works that chopin intended for concert use, the four ballades and four scherzos stand supreme", and adds that "the barcarolle op.
60 stands apart as an example of chopin's rich harmonic palette coupled with an italianate warmth of melody."
temperley opines that these works, which contain "immense variety of mood, thematic material and structural detail", are based on an extended "departure and return" form; "the more the middle section is extended, and the further it departs in key, mood and theme, from the opening idea, the more important and dramatic is the reprise when it at last comes."
chopin's mazurkas and waltzes are all in straightforward ternary or episodic form, sometimes with a coda.
the mazurkas often show more folk features than many of his other works, sometimes including modal scales and harmonies and the use of drone basses.
however, some also show unusual sophistication, for example op.
63 no.
3, which includes a canon at one beat's distance, a great rarity in music.
chopin's polonaises show a marked advance on those of his polish predecessors in the form (who included his teachers żywny and elsner).
as with the traditional polonaise, chopin's works are in triple time and typically display a martial rhythm in their melodies, accompaniments, and cadences.
unlike most of their precursors, they also require a formidable playing technique.
the 21 nocturnes are more structured, and of greater emotional depth, than those of field (whom chopin met in 1833).
many of the chopin nocturnes have middle sections marked by agitated expression (and often making very difficult demands on the performer) which heightens their dramatic character.
chopin's études are largely in straightforward ternary form.
he used them to teach his own technique of piano playing—for instance playing double thirds (op.
25, no.
6), playing in octaves (op.
25, no.
10), and playing repeated notes (op.
10, no.
7).
the preludes, many of which are very brief (some consisting of simple statements and developments of a single theme or figure), were described by schumann as "the beginnings of studies".
inspired by j.s.
bach's the well-tempered clavier, chopin's preludes move up the circle of fifths (rather than bach's chromatic scale sequence) to create a prelude in each major and minor tonality.
the preludes were perhaps not intended to be played as a group, and may even have been used by him and later pianists as generic preludes to others of his pieces, or even to music by other composers, as kenneth hamilton suggests: he has noted a recording by ferruccio busoni of 1922, in which the prelude op.
28 no.
7 is followed by the étude op.
10 no.
5.
the two mature piano sonatas (no.
2, op.
35, written in 1839 and no.
3, op.
58, written in 1844) are in four movements.
in op.
35, chopin was able to combine within a formal large musical structure many elements of his virtuosic piano technique—"a kind of dialogue between the public pianism of the brilliant style and the german sonata principle".
the sonata has been considered as showing the influences of both bach and beethoven.
the prelude from bach's suite no.
6 in d major for cello (bwv 1012) is quoted; and there are references to two sonatas of beethoven: the sonata opus 111 in c minor, and the sonata opus 26 in a flat major,  which, like chopin's op.
35, has a funeral march as its slow movement.
the last movement of chopin's op.
35, a brief (75-bar) perpetuum mobile in which the hands play in unmodified octave unison throughout, was found shocking and unmusical by contemporaries, including schumann.
the op.
58 sonata is closer to the german tradition, including many passages of complex counterpoint, "worthy of brahms" according to the music historians kornel michałowski and jim samson.
chopin's harmonic innovations may have arisen partly from his keyboard improvisation technique.
temperley says that in his works "novel harmonic effects frequently result from the combination of ordinary appoggiaturas or passing notes with melodic figures of accompaniment", and cadences are delayed by the use of chords outside the home key (neapolitan sixths and diminished sevenths), or by sudden shifts to remote keys.
chord progressions sometimes anticipate the shifting tonality of later composers such as claude debussy, as does chopin's use of modal harmony.
in 1841, léon escudier wrote of a recital given by chopin that year, "one may say that chopin is the creator of a school of piano and a school of composition.
in truth, nothing equals the lightness, the sweetness with which the composer preludes on the piano; moreover nothing may be compared to his works full of originality, distinction and grace."
chopin refused to conform to a standard method of playing and believed that there was no set technique for playing well.
his style was based extensively on his use of a very independent finger technique.
in his projet de méthode he wrote: "everything is a matter of knowing good fingering ... we need no less to use the rest of the hand, the wrist, the forearm and the upper arm."
he further stated: "one needs only to study a certain position of the hand in relation to the keys to obtain with ease the most beautiful quality of sound, to know how to play short notes and long notes, and [to attain] unlimited dexterity."
the consequences of this approach to technique in chopin's music include the frequent use of the entire range of the keyboard, passages in double octaves and other chord groupings, swiftly repeated notes, the use of grace notes, and the use of contrasting rhythms (four against three, for example) between the hands.
jonathan bellman writes that modern concert performance style—set in the "conservatory" tradition of late 19th- and 20th-century music schools, and suitable for large auditoria or recordings—militates against what is known of chopin's more intimate performance technique.
the composer himself said to a pupil that "concerts are never real music, you have to give up the idea of hearing in them all the most beautiful things of art."
contemporary accounts indicate that in performance, chopin avoided rigid procedures sometimes incorrectly attributed to him, such as "always crescendo to a high note", but that he was concerned with expressive phrasing, rhythmic consistency and sensitive colouring.
berlioz wrote in 1853 that chopin "has created a kind of chromatic embroidery ... whose effect is so strange and piquant as to be impossible to describe ... virtually nobody but chopin himself can play this music and give it this unusual turn".
hiller wrote that "what in the hands of others was elegant embellishment, in his hands became a colourful wreath of flowers."
chopin's music is frequently played with rubato, "the practice in performance of disregarding strict time, 'robbing' some note-values for expressive effect".
there are differing opinions as to how much, and what type, of rubato is appropriate for his works.
charles rosen comments that "most of the written-out indications of rubato in chopin are to be found in his mazurkas ... it is probable that chopin used the older form of rubato so important to mozart ... [where] the melody note in the right hand is delayed until after the note in the bass ... an allied form of this rubato is the arpeggiation of the chords thereby delaying the melody note; according to chopin's pupil karol mikuli, chopin was firmly opposed to this practice."
friederike müller, a pupil of chopin, wrote: "[his] playing was always noble and beautiful; his tones sang, whether in full forte or softest piano.
he took infinite pains to teach his pupils this legato, cantabile style of playing.
his most severe criticism was 'he—or she—does not know how to join two notes together.'
he also demanded the strictest adherence to rhythm.
he hated all lingering and dragging, misplaced rubatos, as well as exaggerated ritardandos ... and it is precisely in this respect that people make such terrible errors in playing his works."
the "polish character" of chopin's work is unquestionable; not because he also wrote polonaises and mazurkas ... which forms ... were often stuffed with alien ideological and literary contents from the outside.
... as an artist he looked for forms that stood apart from the literary-dramatic character of music which was a feature of romanticism, as a pole he reflected in his work the very essence of the tragic break in the history of the people and instinctively aspired to give the deepest expression of his nation ... for he understood that he could invest his music with the most enduring and truly polish qualities only by liberating art from the confines of dramatic and historical contents.
this attitude toward the question of "national music" – an inspired solution to his art – was the reason why chopin's works have come to be understood everywhere outside of poland ... therein lies the strange riddle of his eternal vigour.
with his mazurkas and polonaises, chopin has been credited with introducing to music a new sense of nationalism.
schumann, in his 1836 review of the piano concertos, highlighted the composer's strong feelings for his native poland, writing that "now that the poles are in deep mourning [after the failure of the november uprising of 1830], their appeal to us artists is even stronger ... if the mighty autocrat in the north [i.e.
nicholas i of russia] could know that in chopin's works, in the simple strains of his mazurkas, there lurks a dangerous enemy, he would place a ban on his music.
chopin's works are cannon buried in flowers!"
the biography of chopin published in 1863 under the name of franz liszt (but probably written by carolyne zu sayn-wittgenstein) states that chopin "must be ranked first among the first musicians ... individualizing in themselves the poetic sense of an entire nation."
some modern commentators have argued against exaggerating chopin's primacy as a "nationalist" or "patriotic" composer.
george golos refers to earlier "nationalist" composers in central europe, including poland's michał kleofas ogiński and franciszek lessel, who utilised polonaise and mazurka forms.
barbara milewski suggests that chopin's experience of polish music came more from "urbanised" warsaw versions than from folk music, and that attempts (by jachimecki and others) to demonstrate genuine folk music in his works are without basis.
richard taruskin impugns schumann's attitude toward chopin's works as patronising and comments that chopin "felt his polish patriotism deeply and sincerely" but consciously modelled his works on the tradition of bach, beethoven, schubert, and field.
a reconciliation of these views is suggested by william atwood: "undoubtedly [chopin's] use of traditional musical forms like the polonaise and mazurka roused nationalistic sentiments and a sense of cohesiveness amongst those poles scattered across europe and the new world ... while some sought solace in [them], others found them a source of strength in their continuing struggle for freedom.
although chopin's music undoubtedly came to him intuitively rather than through any conscious patriotic design, it served all the same to symbolize the will of the polish people ..."
jones comments that "chopin's unique position as a composer, despite the fact that virtually everything he wrote was for the piano, has rarely been questioned."
he also notes that chopin was fortunate to arrive in paris in 1831—"the artistic environment, the publishers who were willing to print his music, the wealthy and aristocratic who paid what chopin asked for their lessons"—and these factors, as well as his musical genius, also fuelled his contemporary and later reputation.
while his illness and his love-affairs conform to some of the stereotypes of romanticism, the rarity of his public recitals (as opposed to performances at fashionable paris soirées) led arthur hutchings to suggest that "his lack of byronic flamboyance [and] his aristocratic reclusiveness make him exceptional" among his romantic contemporaries, such as liszt and henri herz.
chopin's qualities as a pianist and composer were recognised by many of his fellow musicians.
schumann named a piece for him in his suite carnaval, and chopin later dedicated his ballade no.
2 in f major to schumann.
elements of chopin's music can be traced in many of liszt's later works.
liszt later transcribed for piano six of chopin's polish songs.
a less fraught friendship was with alkan, with whom he discussed elements of folk music, and who was deeply affected by chopin's death.
two of chopin's long-standing pupils, karol mikuli (1821–1897) and georges mathias, were themselves piano teachers and passed on details of his playing to their own students, some of whom (such as raoul koczalski) were to make recordings of his music.
other pianists and composers influenced by chopin's style include louis moreau gottschalk, édouard wolff (1816–1880) and pierre zimmermann.
debussy dedicated his own 1915 piano études to the memory of chopin; he frequently played chopin's music during his studies at the paris conservatoire, and undertook the editing of chopin's piano music for the publisher jacques durand.
polish composers of the following generation included virtuosi such as moritz moszkowski, but, in the opinion of j. barrie jones, his "one worthy successor" among his compatriots was karol szymanowski (1882–1937).
edvard grieg, antonín dvořák, isaac albéniz, pyotr ilyich tchaikovsky and sergei rachmaninoff, among others, are regarded by critics as having been influenced by chopin's use of national modes and idioms.
alexander scriabin was devoted to the music of chopin, and his early published works include nineteen mazurkas, as well as numerous études and preludes; his teacher nikolai zverev drilled him in chopin's works to improve his virtuosity as a performer.
in the 20th century, composers who paid homage to (or in some cases parodied) the music of chopin included george crumb, bohuslav martinů, darius milhaud,igor stravinsky and heitor villa-lobos.
chopin's music was used in the 1909 ballet chopiniana, choreographed by michel fokine and orchestrated by alexander glazunov.
sergei diaghilev commissioned additional orchestrations—from stravinsky, anatoly lyadov, sergei taneyev and nikolai tcherepnin—for later productions, which used the title les sylphides.
chopin's music remains very popular and is regularly performed, recorded and broadcast worldwide.
the world's oldest monographic music competition, the international chopin piano competition, founded in 1927, is held every five years in warsaw.
the fryderyk chopin institute of poland lists on its website over eighty societies worldwide devoted to the composer and his music.
the institute site also lists nearly 1,500 performances of chopin works on youtube as of january 2014[update].
the british library notes that "chopin's works have been recorded by all the great pianists of the recording era."
the earliest recording was an 1895 performance by paul pabst of the nocturne in e major op.
62 no.
2. the british library site makes available a number of historic recordings, including some by alfred cortot, ignaz friedman, vladimir horowitz, benno moiseiwitsch, ignacy jan paderewski, arthur rubinstein, xaver scharwenka and many others.
a select discography of recordings of chopin works by pianists representing the various pedagogic traditions stemming from chopin is given by methuen-campbell in his work tracing the lineage and character of those traditions.
numerous recordings of chopin's works are available.
on the occasion of the composer's bicentenary, the critics of the new york times recommended performances by the following contemporary pianists (among many others): martha argerich, vladimir ashkenazy, emanuel ax, evgeny kissin, murray perahia, maurizio pollini and krystian zimerman.
the warsaw chopin society organises the grand prix du disque de f. chopin for notable chopin recordings, held every five years.
chopin has figured extensively in polish literature, both in serious critical studies of his life and music and in fictional treatments.
the earliest manifestation was probably an 1830 sonnet on chopin by leon ulrich.
french writers on chopin (apart from sand) have included marcel proust and andré gide; and he has also featured in works of gottfried benn and boris pasternak.
there are numerous biographies of chopin in english (see bibliography for some of these).
possibly the first venture into fictional treatments of chopin's life was a fanciful operatic version of some of its events.
chopin was written by giacomo orefice and produced in milan in 1901. all the music is derived from that of chopin.
chopin's life and romantic tribulations have been fictionalised in numerous films.
as early as 1919, chopin's relationships with three women – his youth sweetheart mariolka, then with polish singer sonja radkowska, and later with george sand, were portrayed in the german silent film nocturno der liebe (1919), with chopin's music serving as a backdrop.
the 1945 biographical film a song to remember earned cornel wilde an academy award nomination as best actor for his portrayal of the composer.
other film treatments have included: la valse de l'adieu (france, 1928) by henry roussel, with pierre blanchar as chopin; impromptu (1991), starring hugh grant as chopin; la note bleue (1991); and chopin: desire for love (2002).
chopin's life was covered in a 1999 bbc omnibus documentary by andrás schiff and mischa scorer, in a 2010 documentary realised by angelo bozzolini and roberto prosseda for italian television and in a bbc four documentary chopin – the women behind the music (2010).

joão da cruz e sousa (november 24, 1861 – march 19, 1898) was a brazilian poet and journalist, famous for being one of the first brazilian symbolist poets ever.
a descendant of african slaves, he has received the epithets of "black dante" and "black swan".
he is the patron of the 15th chair of the academia catarinense de letras.
cruz e sousa was born joão da cruz in november 24, 1861, in the city of florianópolis (at the time called nossa senhora do desterro), in the brazilian state of santa catarina.
his father was guilherme da cruz, a bricklayer, and his mother was carolina eva da conceição – with both of them being freed afro-brazilian slaves.
sousa's former owner, the marshal guilherme xavier de sousa, treated him like a close relative, teaching him how to read, write and speak greek, french and latin.
he also gave joão da cruz his surname sousa.
cruz e sousa also studied mathematics and natural sciences under the guidance of famous german biologist fritz müller.
in 1881, cruz e sousa served as director of the newspaper tribuna popular, where he wrote abolitionist articles.
in 1883, sousa tried to become an attorney for the city of laguna, but was not accepted for being black.
in 1885 he published his first poetry book, tropos e fantasias, in partnership with virgílio várzea.
in 1890 he moved to rio de janeiro, where he worked as an archivist at the estrada de ferro central do brasil.
in 1893 he published his two famous books missal and broquéis, that introduced the symbolist movement in brazil.
in november of the same year, he married gavita gonçalves, an educated black girl who worked as a seamstress, and had with her four children; however, all four would die prematurely due to tuberculosis, what made gavita have a mental breakdown and go insane ever since.
cruz e sousa died in what is today the city of antônio carlos, in the brazilian state of minas gerais, in march 19, 1898, due to tuberculosis.

johann wolfgang von goethe (/ˈɡɜːtə/, also us: /ˈɡɜːrtə, ˈɡeɪtə, -ti/ gurt-ə, gayt-ə, -⁠ee; german: [ˈjoːhan ˈvɔlfɡaŋ fɔn ˈɡøːtə] (listen); 28 august 1749 – 22 march 1832) was a german writer and statesman.
his works include: four novels; epic and lyric poetry; prose and verse dramas; memoirs; an autobiography; literary and aesthetic criticism; and treatises on botany, anatomy, and colour.
in addition, numerous literary and scientific fragments, more than 10,000 letters, and nearly 3,000 drawings by him have survived.
a literary celebrity by the age of 25, goethe was ennobled by the duke of saxe-weimar, karl august, in 1782 after taking up residence in weimar in november 1775 following the success of his first novel, the sorrows of young werther (1774).
he was an early participant in the sturm und drang literary movement.
during his first ten years in weimar, goethe became a member of the duke's privy council, sat on the war and highway commissions, oversaw the reopening of silver mines in nearby ilmenau, and implemented a series of administrative reforms at the university of jena.
he also contributed to the planning of weimar's botanical park and the rebuilding of its ducal palace.
[a]
goethe's first major scientific work, the metamorphosis of plants, was published after he returned from a 1788 tour of italy.
in 1791 he was made managing director of the theatre at weimar, and in 1794 he began a friendship with the dramatist, historian, and philosopher friedrich schiller, whose plays he premiered until schiller's death in 1805. during this period goethe published his second novel, wilhelm meister's apprenticeship; the verse epic hermann and dorothea, and, in 1808, the first part of his most celebrated drama, faust.
his conversations and various shared undertakings throughout the 1790s with schiller, johann gottlieb fichte, johann gottfried herder, alexander von humboldt, wilhelm von humboldt, and august and friedrich schlegel have come to be collectively termed weimar classicism.
the german philosopher arthur schopenhauer named wilhelm meister's apprenticeship one of the four greatest novels ever written,[b] while the american philosopher and essayist ralph waldo emerson selected goethe as one of six "representative men" in his work of the same name (along with plato, emanuel swedenborg, montaigne, napoleon, and shakespeare).
goethe's comments and observations form the basis of several biographical works, notably johann peter eckermann's conversations with goethe (1836).
goethe's father, johann caspar goethe, lived with his family in a large house (today the goethe house) in frankfurt, then an imperial free city of the holy roman empire.
though he had studied law in leipzig and had been appointed imperial councillor, he was not involved in the city's official affairs.
johann caspar married goethe's mother, catharina elizabeth textor at frankfurt on 20 august 1748, when he was 38 and she was 17. all their children, with the exception of johann wolfgang and his sister, cornelia friederica christiana, who was born in 1750, died at early ages.
his father and private tutors gave goethe lessons in all the common subjects of their time, especially languages (latin, greek, french, italian, english and hebrew).
goethe also received lessons in dancing, riding and fencing.
johann caspar, feeling frustrated in his own ambitions, was determined that his children should have all those advantages that he had not.
although goethe's great passion was drawing, he quickly became interested in literature; friedrich gottlieb klopstock and homer were among his early favorites.
he had a lively devotion to theater as well and was greatly fascinated by puppet shows that were annually arranged in his home; this is a recurrent theme in his literary work wilhelm meister's apprenticeship.
he also took great pleasure in reading works on history and religion.
he writes about this period:
i had from childhood the singular habit of always learning by heart the beginnings of books, and the divisions of a work, first of the five books of moses, and then of the 'aeneid' and ovid's 'metamorphoses'.
... if an ever busy imagination, of which that tale may bear witness, led me hither and thither, if the medley of fable and history, mythology and religion, threatened to bewilder me, i readily fled to those oriental regions, plunged into the first books of moses, and there, amid the scattered shepherd tribes, found myself at once in the greatest solitude and the greatest society.
goethe became also acquainted with frankfurt actors.
among early literary attempts, he was infatuated with gretchen, who would later reappear in his faust and the adventures with whom he would concisely describe in dichtung und wahrheit.
he adored caritas meixner (1750–1773), a wealthy worms trader's daughter and friend of his sister, who would later marry the merchant g. f. schuler.
goethe studied law at leipzig university from 1765 to 1768. he detested learning age-old judicial rules by heart, preferring instead to attend the poetry lessons of christian fürchtegott gellert.
in leipzig, goethe fell in love with anna katharina schönkopf and wrote cheerful verses about her in the rococo genre.
in 1770, he anonymously released annette, his first collection of poems.
his uncritical admiration for many contemporary poets vanished as he became interested in gotthold ephraim lessing and christoph martin wieland.
already at this time, goethe wrote a good deal, but he threw away nearly all of these works, except for the comedy die mitschuldigen.
the restaurant auerbachs keller and its legend of faust's 1525 barrel ride impressed him so much that auerbachs keller became the only real place in his closet drama faust part one.
as his studies did not progress, goethe was forced to return to frankfurt at the close of august 1768.
goethe became severely ill in frankfurt.
during the year and a half that followed, because of several relapses, the relationship with his father worsened.
during convalescence, goethe was nursed by his mother and sister.
in april 1770, goethe left frankfurt in order to finish his studies at the university of strasbourg.
in alsace, goethe blossomed.
no other landscape has he described as affectionately as the warm, wide rhine area.
in strasbourg, goethe met johann gottfried herder.
the two became close friends, and crucially to goethe's intellectual development, herder kindled his interest in shakespeare, ossian and in the notion of volkspoesie (folk poetry).
on 14 october 1772 goethe held a gathering in his parental home in honour of the first german "shakespeare day".
his first acquaintance with shakespeare's works is described as his personal awakening in literature.
on a trip to the village sessenheim, goethe fell in love with friederike brion, in october 1770, but, after ten months, terminated the relationship in august 1771. several of his poems, like "willkommen und abschied", "sesenheimer lieder" and "heidenröslein", originate from this time.
at the end of august 1771, goethe acquired the academic degree of the lizenziat (licentia docendi) in frankfurt and established a small legal practice.
although in his academic work he had expressed the ambition to make jurisprudence progressively more humane, his inexperience led him to proceed too vigorously in his first cases, and he was reprimanded and lost further ones.
this prematurely terminated his career as a lawyer after only a few months.
at this time, goethe was acquainted with the court of darmstadt, where his inventiveness was praised.
from this milieu came johann georg schlosser (who was later to become his brother-in-law) and johann heinrich merck.
goethe also pursued literary plans again; this time, his father did not have anything against it, and even helped.
goethe obtained a copy of the biography of a noble highwayman from the german peasants' war.
in a couple of weeks the biography was reworked into a colourful drama.
entitled götz von berlichingen, the work went directly to the heart of goethe's contemporaries.
goethe could not subsist on being one of the editors of a literary periodical (published by schlosser and merck).
in may 1772 he once more began the practice of law at wetzlar.
in 1774 he wrote the book which would bring him worldwide fame, the sorrows of young werther.
the outer shape of the work's plot is widely taken over from what goethe experienced during his wetzlar time with charlotte buff (1753–1828) and her fiancé, johann christian kestner (1741–1800), as well as from the suicide of the author's friend karl wilhelm jerusalem (1747–1772); in it, goethe made a desperate passion of what was in reality a hearty and relaxed friendship.
despite the immense success of werther, it did not bring goethe much financial gain because copyright laws at the time were essentially nonexistent.
(in later years goethe would bypass this problem by periodically authorizing "new, revised" editions of his complete works.)
in 1775, goethe was invited, on the strength of his fame as the author of the sorrows of young werther, to the court of karl august, duke of saxe-weimar-eisenach, who would become grand duke in 1815.
(the duke at the time was 18 years of age, to goethe's 26.)
goethe thus went to live in weimar, where he remained for the rest of his life and where, over the course of many years, he held a succession of offices, becoming the duke's friend and chief adviser.
in 1776, goethe formed a close relationship to charlotte von stein, an older, married woman.
the intimate bond with von stein lasted for ten years, after which goethe abruptly left for italy without giving his companion any notice.
she was emotionally distraught at the time, but they were eventually reconciled.
goethe, aside from official duties, was also a friend and confidant to the duke, and participated fully in the activities of the court.
for goethe, his first ten years at weimar could well be described as a garnering of a degree and range of experience which perhaps could be achieved in no other way.
in 1779, goethe took on the war commission of the grand duchy of saxe-weimar, in addition to the mines and highways commissions.
in 1782, when the chancellor of the duchy's exchequer left his office, goethe agreed to act in his place for two and a half years; this post virtually made him prime minister and the principal representative of the duchy.
goethe was ennobled in 1782 (this being indicated by the "von" in his name).
as head of the saxe-weimar war commission, goethe participated in the recruitment of mercenaries into the prussian and british military during the american revolution.
the author w. daniel wilson [de] claims that goethe engaged in negotiating the forced sale of vagabonds, criminals, and political dissidents as part of these activities.
goethe's journey to the italian peninsula and sicily from 1786 to 1788 was of great significance in his aesthetic and philosophical development.
his father had made a similar journey during his own youth, and his example was a major motivating factor for goethe to make the trip.
more importantly, however, the work of johann joachim winckelmann had provoked a general renewed interest in the classical art of ancient greece and rome.
thus goethe's journey had something of the nature of a pilgrimage to it.
during the course of his trip goethe met and befriended the artists angelica kauffman and johann heinrich wilhelm tischbein, as well as encountering such notable characters as lady hamilton and alessandro cagliostro (see affair of the diamond necklace).
he also journeyed to sicily during this time, and wrote intriguingly that "to have seen italy without having seen sicily is to not have seen italy at all, for sicily is the clue to everything."
while in southern italy and sicily, goethe encountered, for the first time genuine greek (as opposed to roman) architecture, and was quite startled by its relative simplicity.
winckelmann had not recognized the distinctness of the two styles.
goethe's diaries of this period form the basis of the non-fiction italian journey.
italian journey only covers the first year of goethe's visit.
the remaining year is largely undocumented, aside from the fact that he spent much of it in venice.
this "gap in the record" has been the source of much speculation over the years.
in the decades which immediately followed its publication in 1816, italian journey inspired countless german youths to follow goethe's example.
this is pictured, somewhat satirically, in george eliot's middlemarch.
in late 1792, goethe took part in the battle of valmy against revolutionary france, assisting duke karl august of saxe-weimar-eisenach during the failed invasion of france.
again during the siege of mainz he assisted carl august as a military observer.
his written account of these events can be found within his complete works.
in 1794, friedrich schiller wrote to goethe offering friendship; they had previously had only a mutually wary relationship ever since first becoming acquainted in 1788. this collaborative friendship lasted until schiller's death in 1805.
in 1806, goethe was living in weimar with his mistress christiane vulpius, the sister of christian a. vulpius, and their son julius august walter von goethe.
on 13 october, napoleon's army invaded the town.
the french "spoon guards", the least disciplined soldiers, occupied goethe's house:
the 'spoon guards' had broken in, they had drunk wine, made a great uproar and called for the master of the house.
goethe's secretary riemer reports: 'although already undressed and wearing only his wide nightgown... he descended the stairs towards them and inquired what they wanted from him.... his dignified figure, commanding respect, and his spiritual mien seemed to impress even them.'
but it was not to last long.
late at night they burst into his bedroom with drawn bayonets.
goethe was petrified, christiane raised a lot of noise and even tangled with them, other people who had taken refuge in goethe's house rushed in, and so the marauders eventually withdrew again.
it was christiane who commanded and organized the defense of the house on the frauenplan.
the barricading of the kitchen and the cellar against the wild pillaging soldiery was her work.
goethe noted in his diary: "fires, rapine, a frightful night... preservation of the house through steadfastness and luck."
the luck was goethe's, the steadfastness was displayed by christiane.
days afterward, on 19 october 1806, goethe legitimized their 18-year relationship by marrying christiane in a quiet marriage service at the jakobskirche in weimar [de].
they had already had several children together by this time, including their son, julius august walter von goethe (1789–1830), whose wife, ottilie von pogwisch (1796–1872), cared for the elder goethe until his death in 1832. august and ottilie had three children: walther, freiherr von goethe (1818–1885), wolfgang, freiherr von goethe [de] (1820–1883) and alma von goethe [de] (1827–1844).
christiane von goethe died in 1816. johann reflected, "there is nothing more charming to see than a mother with her child in her arms, and there is nothing more venerable than a mother among a number of her children."
after 1793, goethe devoted his endeavours primarily to literature.
by 1820, goethe was on amiable terms with kaspar maria von sternberg.in 1823, having recovered from a near fatal heart illness, goethe fell in love with ulrike von levetzow whom he wanted to marry, but because of the opposition of her mother he never proposed.
their last meeting in carlsbad on 5 september 1823 inspired him to the famous marienbad elegy which he considered one of his finest works.
during that time he also developed a deep emotional bond with the polish pianist maria agata szymanowska.
in 1821 goethe's friend carl friedrich zelter introduced him to the 12 year old felix mendelssohn.
goethe, now in his seventies, was greatly impressed by the child, leading to perhaps the earliest confirmed comparison with mozart in the following conversation between goethe and zelter:
"musical prodigies ... are probably no longer so rare; but what this little man can do in extemporizing and playing at sight borders the miraculous, and i could not have believed it possible at so early an age."
"and yet you heard mozart in his seventh year at frankfurt?"
said zelter.
"yes", answered goethe, "... but what your pupil already accomplishes, bears the same relation to the mozart of that time that the cultivated talk of a grown-up person bears to the prattle of a child."
mendelssohn was invited to meet goethe on several later occasions, and set a number of goethe's poems to music.
his other compositions inspired by goethe include the overture calm sea and prosperous voyage (op.
27, 1828), and the cantata die erste walpurgisnacht (the first walpurgis night, op.
60, 1832).
in 1832, goethe died in weimar of apparent heart failure.
his last words, according to his doctor carl vogel, were, mehr licht!
(more light!
), but this is disputed as vogel was not in the room at the moment goethe died.
he is buried in the ducal vault at weimar's historical cemetery.
eckermann closes his famous work, conversations with goethe, with this passage:
the morning after goethe's death, a deep desire seized me to look once again upon his earthly garment.
his faithful servant, frederick, opened for me the chamber in which he was laid out.
stretched upon his back, he reposed as if asleep; profound peace and security reigned in the features of his sublimely noble countenance.
the mighty brow seemed yet to harbour thoughts.
i wished for a lock of his hair; but reverence prevented me from cutting it off.
the body lay naked, only wrapped in a white sheet; large pieces of ice had been placed near it, to keep it fresh as long as possible.
frederick drew aside the sheet, and i was astonished at the divine magnificence of the limbs.
the breast was powerful, broad, and arched; the arms and thighs were elegant, and of the most perfect shape; nowhere, on the whole body, was there a trace of either fat or of leanness and decay.
a perfect man lay in great beauty before me; and the rapture the sight caused me made me forget for a moment that the immortal spirit had left such an abode.
i laid my hand on his heart – there was a deep silence – and i turned away to give free vent to my suppressed tears.
the first production of richard wagner's opera lohengrin took place in weimar in 1850. the conductor was franz liszt, who chose the date 28 august in honour of goethe, who was born on 28 august 1749.
the most important of goethe's works produced before he went to weimar were götz von berlichingen (1773), a tragedy that was the first work to bring him recognition, and the novel the sorrows of young werther (german: die leiden des jungen werthers) (1774), which gained him enormous fame as a writer in the sturm und drang period which marked the early phase of romanticism.
indeed, werther is often considered to be the "spark" which ignited the movement, and can arguably be called the world's first "best-seller."
during the years at weimar before he met schiller he began wilhelm meister's apprenticeship, wrote the dramas iphigenie auf tauris (iphigenia in tauris), egmont, torquato tasso, and the fable reineke fuchs.
[citation needed]
to the period of his friendship with schiller belong the conception of wilhelm meister's journeyman years (the continuation of wilhelm meister's apprenticeship), the idyll of hermann and dorothea, the roman elegies  and the verse drama the natural daughter.
in the last period, between schiller's death, in 1805, and his own, appeared faust part one, elective affinities, the west-eastern diwan (a collection of poems in the persian style, influenced by the work of hafez), his autobiographical aus meinem leben: dichtung und wahrheit (from my life: poetry and truth) which covers his early life and ends with his departure for weimar, his italian journey, and a series of treatises on art.
his writings were immediately influential in literary and artistic circles.
[citation needed]
goethe was fascinated by kalidasa's abhijñānaśākuntalam, which was one of the first works of sanskrit literature that became known in europe, after being translated from english to german.
the short epistolary novel, die leiden des jungen werthers, or the sorrows of young werther, published in 1774, recounts an unhappy romantic infatuation that ends in suicide.
goethe admitted that he "shot his hero to save himself": a reference to goethe's own near-suicidal obsession with a young woman during this period, an obsession he quelled through the writing process.
the novel remains in print in dozens of languages and its influence is undeniable; its central hero, an obsessive figure driven to despair and destruction by his unrequited love for the young lotte, has become a pervasive literary archetype.
the fact that werther ends with the protagonist's suicide and funeral—a funeral which "no clergyman attended"—made the book deeply controversial upon its (anonymous) publication, for on the face of it, it appeared to condone and glorify suicide.
suicide is considered sinful by christian doctrine: suicides were denied christian burial with the bodies often mistreated and dishonoured in various ways; in corollary, the deceased's property and possessions were often confiscated by the church.
however, goethe explained his use of werther in his autobiography.
he said he "turned reality into poetry but his friends thought poetry should be turned into reality and the poem imitated."
he was against this reading of poetry.
epistolary novels were common during this time, letter-writing being a primary mode of communication.
what set goethe's book apart from other such novels was its expression of unbridled longing for a joy beyond possibility, its sense of defiant rebellion against authority, and of principal importance, its total subjectivity: qualities that trailblazed the romantic movement.
the next work, his epic closet drama faust, was completed in stages.
the first part was published in 1808 and created a sensation.
goethe finished faust part two in the year of his death, and the work was published posthumously.
goethe's original draft of a faust play, which probably dates from 1773–74, and is now known as the urfaust, was also published after his death.
the first operatic version of goethe's faust, by louis spohr, appeared in 1814. the work subsequently inspired operas and oratorios by schumann, berlioz, gounod, boito, busoni, and schnittke as well as symphonic works by liszt, wagner, and mahler.
faust became the ur-myth of many figures in the 19th century.
later, a facet of its plot, i.e., of selling one's soul to the devil for power over the physical world, took on increasing literary importance and became a view of the victory of technology and of industrialism, along with its dubious human expenses.
in 1919, the world premiere complete production of faust was staged at the goetheanum.
goethe's poetic work served as a model for an entire movement in german poetry termed innerlichkeit ("introversion") and represented by, for example, heine.
goethe's words inspired a number of compositions by, among others, mozart, beethoven (who idolised goethe), schubert, berlioz and wolf.
perhaps the single most influential piece is "mignon's song" which opens with one of the most famous lines in german poetry, an allusion to italy: "kennst du das land, wo die zitronen blühn?"
("do you know the land where the lemon trees bloom?
").
he is also widely quoted.
epigrams such as "against criticism a man can neither protest nor defend himself; he must act in spite of it, and then it will gradually yield to him", "divide and rule, a sound motto; unite and lead, a better one", and "enjoy when you can, and endure when you must", are still in usage or are often paraphrased.
lines from faust, such as "das also war des pudels kern", "das ist der weisheit letzter schluss", or "grau ist alle theorie" have entered everyday german usage.
some well-known quotations are often incorrectly attributed to goethe.
these include hippocrates' "art is long, life is short", which is echoed in goethe's faust and wilhelm meister's apprenticeship.
as to what i have done as a poet,... i take no pride in it... but that in my century i am the only person who knows the truth in the difficult science of colours—of that, i say, i am not a little proud, and here i have a consciousness of a superiority to many.
although his literary work has attracted the greatest amount of interest, goethe was also keenly involved in studies of natural science.
he wrote several works on morphology, and colour theory.
goethe also had the largest private collection of minerals in all of europe.
by the time of his death, in order to gain a comprehensive view in geology, he had collected 17,800 rock samples.
his focus on morphology and what was later called homology influenced 19th century naturalists, although his ideas of transformation were about the continuous metamorphosis of living things and did not relate to contemporary ideas of "transformisme" or transmutation of species.
homology, or as étienne geoffroy saint-hilaire called it "analogie", was used by charles darwin as strong evidence of common descent and of laws of variation.
goethe's studies (notably with an elephant's skull lent to him by samuel thomas von soemmerring) led him to independently discover the human intermaxillary bone, also known as "goethe's bone", in 1784, which broussonet (1779) and vicq d'azyr (1780) had (using different methods) identified several years earlier.
while not the only one in his time to question the prevailing view that this bone did not exist in humans, goethe, who believed ancient anatomists had known about this bone, was the first to prove its existence in all mammals.
the elephant's skull that led goethe to this discovery, and was subsequently named the goethe elephant, still exists and is displayed in the ottoneum in kassel, germany.
during his italian journey, goethe formulated a theory of plant metamorphosis in which the archetypal form of the plant is to be found in the leaf – he writes, "from top to bottom a plant is all leaf, united so inseparably with the future bud that one cannot be imagined without the other".
in 1790, he published his metamorphosis of plants.
as one of the many precursors in the history of evolutionary thought, goethe wrote in story of my botanical studies (1831):
the ever-changing display of plant forms, which i have followed for so many years, awakens increasingly within me the notion: the plant forms which surround us were not all created at some given point in time and then locked into the given form, they have been given... a felicitous mobility and plasticity that allows them to grow and adapt themselves to many different conditions in many different places.
goethe's botanical theories were partly based on his gardening in weimar.
goethe also popularized the goethe barometer using a principle established by torricelli.
according to hegel, "goethe has occupied himself a good deal with meteorology; barometer readings interested him particularly... what he says is important: the main thing is that he gives a comparative table of barometric readings during the whole month of december 1822, at weimar, jena, london, boston, vienna, töpel... he claims to deduce from it that the barometric level varies in the same proportion not only in each zone but that it has the same variation, too, at different altitudes above sea-level".
in 1810, goethe published his theory of colours, which he considered his most important work.
in it, he contentiously characterized colour as arising from the dynamic interplay of light and darkness through the mediation of a turbid medium.
in 1816, schopenhauer went on to develop his own theory in on vision and colours based on the observations supplied in goethe's book.
after being translated into english by charles eastlake in 1840, his theory became widely adopted by the art world, most notably j. m. w. turner.
goethe's work also inspired the philosopher ludwig wittgenstein, to write his remarks on colour.
goethe was vehemently opposed to newton's analytic treatment of colour, engaging instead in compiling a comprehensive rational description of a wide variety of colour phenomena.
although the accuracy of goethe's observations does not admit a great deal of criticism, his aesthetic approach did not lend itself to the demands of analytic and mathematical analysis used ubiquitously in modern science.
goethe was, however, the first to systematically study the physiological effects of colour, and his observations on the effect of opposed colours led him to a symmetric arrangement of his colour wheel, 'for the colours diametrically opposed to each other... are those which reciprocally evoke each other in the eye.
(goethe, theory of colours, 1810).
in this, he anticipated ewald hering's opponent colour theory (1872).
goethe outlines his method in the essay the experiment as mediator between subject and object (1772).
in the kurschner edition of goethe's works, the science editor, rudolf steiner, presents goethe's approach to science as phenomenological.
steiner elaborated on that in the books the theory of knowledge implicit in goethe's world-conception and goethe's world view, in which he characterizes intuition as the instrument by which one grasps goethe's biological archetype—the typus.
novalis, himself a geologist and mining engineer, expressed the opinion that goethe was the first physicist of his time and 'epoch-making in the history of physics', writing that goethe's studies of light, of the metamorphosis of plants and of insects were indications and proofs 'that the perfect educational lecture belongs in the artist's sphere of work'; and that goethe would be surpassed 'but only in the way in which the ancients can be surpassed, in inner content and force, in variety and depth—as an artist actually not, or only very little, for his rightness and intensity are perhaps already more exemplary than it would seem'.
many of goethe's works, especially faust, the roman elegies, and the venetian epigrams, depict erotic passions and acts.
for instance, in faust, the first use of faust's power after signing a contract with the devil is to seduce a teenage girl.
some of the venetian epigrams were held back from publication due to their sexual content.
goethe clearly saw human sexuality as a topic worthy of poetic and artistic depiction, an idea that was uncommon in a time when the private nature of sexuality was rigorously normative.
in a conversation on april 7, 1830 goethe stated that pederasty is an "aberration" that easily leads to "animal, roughly material" behavior.
he continued, "pederasty is as old as humanity itself, and one can therefore say, that it resides in nature, even if it proceeds against nature....what culture has won from nature will not be surrendered or given up at any price."
on another occasion he wrote: "i like boys a lot, but the girls are even nicer.
if i tire of her as a girl, she'll play the boy for me as well".
goethe was a freethinker who believed that one could be inwardly christian without following any of the christian churches, many of whose central teachings he firmly opposed, sharply distinguishing between christ and the tenets of christian theology, and criticizing its history as a "hodgepodge of fallacy and violence".
his own descriptions of his relationship to the christian faith and even to the church varied widely and have been interpreted even more widely, so that while goethe's secretary eckermann portrayed him as enthusiastic about christianity, jesus, martin luther, and the protestant reformation, even calling christianity the "ultimate religion," on one occasion goethe described himself as "not anti-christian, nor un-christian, but most decidedly non-christian," and in his venetian epigram 66, goethe listed the symbol of the cross among the four things that he most disliked.
according to nietzsche, goethe had "a kind of almost joyous and trusting fatalism" that has "faith that only in the totality everything redeems itself and appears good and justified."
born into a lutheran family, goethe's early faith was shaken by news of such events as the 1755 lisbon earthquake and the seven years' war.
goethe's preoccupation with and reverence for spinoza are well known and documented in the history of western thought.
he was one of the central figures in a great flowering of a highly influential neo-spinozism which occurred in german philosophy and literature of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.—that was the first remarkable spinoza revival in history.
like lessing and herder, in many respects, goethe was a devoted spinozist.
he was also a pantheist, like some other prominent spinozists such as flaubert and einstein.
his later spiritual perspective incorporated elements of pantheism (heavily influenced by spinoza's thought), humanism, and various elements of western esotericism, as seen most vividly in part 2 of faust.
like heinrich heine, nietzsche mentions in his writings frequently goethe and spinoza as a pair.
a year before his death, in a letter to sulpiz boisserée, goethe wrote that he had the feeling that all his life he had been aspiring to qualify as one of the hypsistarians, an ancient jewish-pagan sect of the black sea region who, in his understanding, sought to reverence, as being close to the godhead, what came to their knowledge of the best and most perfect.
goethe's unorthodox religious beliefs led him to be called "the great heathen" and provoked distrust among the authorities of his time, who opposed the creation of a goethe monument on account of his offensive religious creed.
august wilhelm schlegel considered goethe "a heathen who converted to islam."
politically, goethe described himself as a "moderate liberal", expressing sympathy for the liberalism of étienne dumont.
at the time of the french revolution, he thought the enthusiasm of the students and professors to be a perversion of their energy and remained skeptical of the ability of the masses to govern.
goethe sympathized with the american revolution and later wrote a poem in which he declared "america, you're better off than our continent, the old."
he did not join in the anti-napoleonic mood of 1812, and he distrusted the strident nationalism which started to be expressed.
the medievalism of the heidelberg romantics was also repellent to goethe's eighteenth-century ideal of a supra-national culture.
goethe was a freemason, joining the lodge amalia in weimar in 1780, and frequently alluded to masonic themes of universal brotherhood in his work, he was also attracted to the bavarian illuminati a secret society founded on 1 may 1776. although often requested to write poems arousing nationalist passions, goethe would always decline.
in old age, he explained why this was so to eckermann:
how could i write songs of hatred when i felt no hate?
and, between ourselves, i never hated the french, although i thanked god when we were rid of them.
how could i, to whom the only significant things are civilization [kultur] and barbarism, hate a nation which is among the most cultivated in the world, and to which i owe a great part of my own culture?
in any case this business of hatred between nations is a curious thing.
you will always find it more powerful and barbarous on the lowest levels of civilization.
but there exists a level at which it wholly disappears, and where one stands, so to speak, above the nations, and feels the weal or woe of a neighboring people as though it were one's own.
goethe had a great effect on the nineteenth century.
in many respects, he was the originator of many ideas which later became widespread.
he produced volumes of poetry, essays, criticism, a theory of colours and early work on evolution and linguistics.
he was fascinated by mineralogy, and the mineral goethite (iron oxide) is named after him.
his non-fiction writings, most of which are philosophic and aphoristic in nature, spurred the development of many thinkers, including georg wilhelm friedrich hegel, schopenhauer, søren kierkegaard, friedrich nietzsche, ernst cassirer, and carl jung.
[citation needed] along with schiller, he was one of the leading figures of weimar classicism.
schopenhauer cited goethe's novel wilhelm meister's apprenticeship as one of the four greatest novels ever written, along with tristram shandy, la nouvelle héloïse and don quixote.
nietzsche wrote, "four pairs it was that did not deny themselves to my sacrifice: epicurus and montaigne, goethe and spinoza, plato and rousseau, pascal and schopenhauer.
with these i must come to terms when i have long wandered alone; they may call me right and wrong; to them will i listen when in the process they call each other right and wrong."
goethe embodied many of the contending strands in art over the next century: his work could be lushly emotional, and rigorously formal, brief and epigrammatic, and epic.
he would argue that classicism was the means of controlling art, and that romanticism was a sickness, even as he penned poetry rich in memorable images, and rewrote the formal rules of german poetry.
his poetry was set to music by almost every major austrian and german composer from mozart to mahler, and his influence would spread to french drama and opera as well.
beethoven declared that a "faust" symphony would be the greatest thing for art.
liszt and mahler both created symphonies in whole or in large part inspired by this seminal work, which would give the 19th century one of its most paradigmatic figures: doctor faustus.
the faust tragedy/drama, often called das drama der deutschen (the drama of the germans), written in two parts published decades apart, would stand as his most characteristic and famous artistic creation.
followers of the twentieth century esotericist rudolf steiner built a theatre named the goetheanum after him—where festival performances of faust are still performed.
goethe was also a cultural force.
during his first meeting with napoleon in 1808, the latter famously remarked: "vous étes un homme (you are a man)!"
the two discussed politics, the writings of voltaire, and goethe's sorrows of young werther, which napoleon had read seven times and ranked among his favorites.
goethe came away from the meeting deeply impressed with napoleon's enlightened intellect and his efforts to build an alternative to the corrupt old regime.
goethe always spoke of napoleon with the greatest respect, confessing that "nothing higher and more pleasing could have happened to me in all my life" than to have met napoleon in person.
germaine de staël, in de l'allemagne (1813), presented german classicism and romanticism as a potential source of spiritual authority for europe, and identified goethe as a living classic.
she praised goethe as possessing "the chief characteristics of the german genius" and uniting "all that distinguishes the german mind."
staël's portrayal helped elevate goethe over his more famous german contemporaries and transformed him into a european cultural hero.
goethe met with her and her partner benjamin constant, with whom he shared a mutual admiration.
in victorian england, goethe exerted a profound influence on george eliot, whose partner george henry lewes wrote a life of goethe.
eliot presented goethe as "eminently the man who helps us to rise to a lofty point of observation" and praised his "large tolerance", which "quietly follows the stream of fact and of life" without passing moral judgments.
matthew arnold found in goethe the "physician of the iron age" and "the clearest, the largest, the most helpful thinker of modern times" with a "large, liberal view of life."
it was to a considerable degree due to goethe's reputation that the city of weimar was chosen in 1919 as the venue for the national assembly, convened to draft a new constitution for what would become known as germany's weimar republic.
goethe became a key reference for thomas mann in his speeches and essays defending the republic.
he emphasized goethe's "cultural and self-developing individualism", humanism, and cosmopolitanism.
the federal republic of germany's cultural institution, the goethe-institut is named after him, and promotes the study of german abroad and fosters knowledge about germany by providing information on its culture, society and politics.
the literary estate of goethe in the goethe and schiller archives was inscribed on unesco's memory of the world register in 2001 in recognition of its historical significance.
goethe's influence was dramatic because he understood that there was a transition in european sensibilities, an increasing focus on sense, the indescribable, and the emotional.
this is not to say that he was emotionalistic or excessive; on the contrary, he lauded personal restraint and felt that excess was a disease: "there is nothing worse than imagination without taste".
goethe praised francis bacon for his advocacy of science based on experiment and his forceful revolution in thought as one of the greatest strides forward in modern science.
however, he was critical of bacon's inductive method and approach based on pure classification.
he said in scientific studies:
we conceive of the individual animal as a small world, existing for its own sake, by its own means.
every creature is its own reason to be.
all its parts have a direct effect on one another, a relationship to one another, thereby constantly renewing the circle of life; thus we are justified in considering every animal physiologically perfect.
viewed from within, no part of the animal is a useless or arbitrary product of the formative impulse (as so often thought).
externally, some parts may seem useless because the inner coherence of the animal nature has given them this form without regard to outer circumstance.
thus...[not] the question, what are they for?
but rather, where do they come from?
goethe's scientific and aesthetic ideas have much in common with denis diderot, whose work he translated and studied.
both diderot and goethe exhibited a repugnance towards the mathematical interpretation of nature; both perceived the universe as dynamic and in constant flux; both saw "art and science as compatible disciplines linked by common imaginative processes"; and both grasped "the unconscious impulses underlying mental creation in all forms."
goethe's naturanschauer is in many ways a sequel to diderot's interprète de la nature.
his views make him, along with adam smith, thomas jefferson, and ludwig van beethoven, a figure in two worlds: on the one hand, devoted to the sense of taste, order, and finely crafted detail, which is the hallmark of the artistic sense of the age of reason and the neo-classical period of architecture; on the other, seeking a personal, intuitive, and personalized form of expression and society, firmly supporting the idea of self-regulating and organic systems.
george henry lewes celebrated goethe's revolutionary understanding of the organism.
thinkers such as ralph waldo emerson would take up many similar ideas in the 1800s.
goethe's ideas on evolution would frame the question that darwin and wallace would approach within the scientific paradigm.
the serbian inventor and electrical engineer nikola tesla was heavily influenced by goethe's faust, his favorite poem, and had actually memorized the entire text.
it was while reciting a certain verse that he was struck with the epiphany that would lead to the idea of the rotating magnetic field and ultimately, alternating current.

luís gonzaga pinto da gama (june 21, 1830 – august 24, 1882) was a brazilian romantic poet, journalist, lawyer, republican and a prominent abolitionist.
gama was born free in 1830 in bahia, to a portuguese fidalgo who lost all his fortune with gambling, and luísa mahin (also spelled maheu), a free african woman of "mina" nation who sold foodstuff in the city market.
according to gama, she was involved in a rebellion that may have been the 1835 malê revolt, which is why she had to eventually flee bahia in 1837.
in 1840, when gama was 10 years old, his papa sold him illegally, allegedly because of gambling debts.
gama never revealed the identity of his father to preserve his father's name after committing this injustice.
gama was first shipped to a port in rio de janeiro and from there was taken to a province in são paulo.
gama was bought by an alférez named antônio pereira cardoso.
cardoso would try to sell him, but no one would buy gama, since he was originally from bahia, and bahian slaves had the fame of being runaways.
cardoso then decided to use gama as a housekeeper in his farm in the city of lorena.
in 1847, a law student named antônio rodrigues de araújo stayed in cardoso's house.
he and gama developed a strong friendship, and araújo taught gama how to read and write.
thus, gama was able to understand the illegality of his condition, ran away from cardoso, and regained his freedom in 1848.
in 1858 gama met claudina fortunata de sampio and had a child with her a year after by the name of benedito graco pinto de gama.
the godfather of his only son was francisco maria de sousa furtado de mendonca.
mendonca, who was a big mentor for gama and his law career.
since gama and sampio were freed slaves, they had to wait to register their marriage until 1869.
gama died in 1882 because of diabetes, with thousands of people mourning his death in são paulo due to his role in the abolitionist movement and freeing more than one thousand slaves in são paulo through law.
after regaining his freedom, gama joined a military police force in 1848. after six years, gama was discharged from the militia for insubordination as he admitted to threatening another officer who insulted him.
in addition to being discharged, gama was also imprisoned for thirty-nine days for insubordination.
after being discharged, gama worked at the police station in são paulo as a copyist and was eventually promoted to the police secretariat from 1856 to 1868. however, when the brazilian conservative party came into power gama was dismissed.
after his dismissal, gama became an editor for o piranga, which was one of the most influential newspapers in brazil at the time, where gama published anti-slavery articles under a pseudonym.
gama worked a second job as a clerk in the private office of a high-ranking police officer by the name of francisco maria de sousa furtado de mendonca, who eventually became a professor and dean at faculdade de direito da universidade de são paulo.
this allowed gama to study law at the faculdade de direito da universidade de são paulo, but did not finish the course.
in later life, he would work as a rábula, that is, a non-graduated lawyer with permission of the government to follow that career.
gama was an active opponent of brazilian monarchy and helped create the republican party of são paulo in 1873. gama not only wanted to abolish slavery but also wanted afro-brazilians to actively participate in the abolitionist movement as well as the democratization of brazil.
however, gama eventually denounced the group as some elite plantain owners who were members of the party wrote a manifesto asking  for gradual emancipation and no punishment for slave owners.
as a lawyer, gama defended blacks in court who were illegally enslaved, especially those who were enslaved after slave trade was abolished in 1831, and fought for their rights.
gama freed more than 500 slaves through the courts and also purchased the freedom of individual slaves.
not only did gama use his knowledge of law to help slaves, but also promoted the abolitionist movement through lectures, journals, and by fundraising.
as gama established a positive reputation of being an attorney, he received funding from women's organizations and private sources for his anti-slavery stance.
in 1881, the luís  gama emancipation fund was created to help freedom for slaves.
additionally, gama established the abolitionist center of são paulo in 1882 and was the leader of the abolitionist movement in são paulo.
throughout gama's careers, he would write in his free time for journals, newspapers, and eventually wrote his own books.
in 1859, gama published his first book primeiras trovas burlescas de getulino (getulino's first burlesque ballads), under the pen name "getulino."
most of the poems are satires about the customs of the 19th-century brazilian monarchist aristocracy and also criticized mulatto society for their emphasis on pseudo-whiteness.
due to the success of his first book, gama published a second edition of primeiras trovas burlescas de getulino in 1861. through poetry gama not only mocked racism in brazil but also celebrated black beauty and the afro-brazilian culture.
during the 1860s gama also became a journalist, collaborating with angelo agostini in ipiranga, coroaci and o polichileno.
gama worked specifically as a typographer for ipiranga and coroaci.
he founded the journal radical paulistano in 1869 with other prominent abolitionists such as rui barbosa, joaquim nabuco, and castro alves.
gama also was the founder of a satirical journal by the name of diablo coxo, where he published political and social satire as well as anti-slavery propaganda.
gama's political journalism heavily influenced the work and beliefs of raul pompeia..mw-parser-output .portal{border:solid #aaa 1px;padding:0}.mw-parser-output .portal.tleft{margin:0.5em 1em 0.5em 0}.mw-parser-output .portal.tright{margin:0.5em 0 0.5em 1em}.mw-parser-output .portal>ul{display:table;box-sizing:border-box;padding:0.1em;max-width:175px;background:#f9f9f9;font-size:85%;line-height:110%;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold}.mw-parser-output .portal>ul>li{display:table-row}.mw-parser-output .portal>ul>li>span:first-child{display:table-cell;padding:0.2em;vertical-align:middle;text-align:center}.mw-parser-output .portal>ul>li>span:last-child{display:table-cell;padding:0.2em 0.2em 0.2em 0.3em;vertical-align:middle}

bueno was the year-end number-one ranked female player in 1959 and 1960 and was known for her graceful style of play.
in 1960, bueno became the first woman ever to win a calendar-year grand slam in doubles (all four majors in a year), three of them with darlene hard and one with christine truman.
bueno was born in são paulo.
according to her official website, her father, a businessman, was a keen club tennis player.
her elder brother pedro was also a tennis player.
she began playing tennis aged six at the clube de regatas tiete in são paulo and, without having received any formal training, won her first tournament at age 12. she was 15 when she won her country's women's singles championship.
she first went abroad in 1957 at age 17 and won the orange bowl juniors tournament in florida, usa.
joining the international circuit in 1958, bueno won the singles title at the italian championships.
[a] the same year she gained the first of her grand slam titles, winning the women's doubles at wimbledon with althea gibson.
the following year, bueno won her first singles title at wimbledon, defeating darlene hard in the final.
she also won the singles title at the u.s. championships after a straight-sets victory in the final against christine truman, earning the world no.
1 ranking for 1959 and the associated press female athlete of the year award.
bueno was the first non-north-american woman to win both wimbledon and the u.s. championships in the same calendar year.
in her native brazil, she returned as a national heroine, honored by the country's president and given a ticker-tape parade on the streets of são paulo.
according to lance tingay of the daily telegraph and the daily mail and bud collins, bueno was ranked in the world top ten from 1958 through 1960 and from 1962 through 1968, reaching a career high of world no.
1 in those rankings in 1959 and 1960.  the international tennis hall of fame also lists her as the top ranked player in 1964 (after losing the final at the french championships and winning both wimbledon and the u.s. championships) and 1966.
bueno won the singles title at wimbledon three times and at the u.s. championships four times.
she was a singles finalist at the australian championships and the french championships, losing both finals to margaret smith.
bueno reached at least the quarterfinals in each of the first 26 grand slam singles tournaments she played.
this streak ended at wimbledon in 1967 when she lost in the fourth round because of an arm injury.
[citation needed]
as a doubles player, bueno won twelve grand slam championships with six different partners.

félix rubén garcía sarmiento (january 18, 1867 – february 6, 1916), known as rubén darío (us: /dɑːˈriːoʊ/ dah-ree-oh, spanish: [ruˈβen daˈɾi.o]), was a nicaraguan poet who initiated the spanish-american literary movement known as modernismo (modernism) that flourished at the end of the 19th century.
darío has had a great and lasting influence on 20th-century spanish literature and journalism.
he has been praised as the "prince of castilian letters" and undisputed father of the modernismo literary movement.
his parents, manuel garcía and rosa sarmiento were married on april 26, 1866, in león, nicaragua, after obtaining the necessary ecclesiastic permissions since they were second degree cousins.
however, manuel's conduct of allegedly engaging in excessive consumption of alcohol prompted rosa to abandon her conjugal home and flee to the city of metapa in matagalpa where she gave birth to félix rubén.
the couple made up and rosa even gave birth to a second child, a daughter named cándida rosa, who died a few days after being born.
the marriage deteriorated again to the point where rosa left her husband and moved in with her aunt, bernarda sarmiento.
after a brief period of time, rosa sarmiento established a relationship with another man and moved with him to san marcos de colón, in choluteca, honduras.
rubén darío was born in metapa, matagalpa, nicaragua.
although, according to his baptism, rubén's true surname was garcía, his paternal family had been known by the surname darío for many years.
rubén darío explained it as follows in his autobiography:
according to what some of the old people in that town of my childhood have referred to me, my great-grandfather had darío as his nickname or first name.
in this small town he was known by everyone as "don darío" and his entire family as the daríos.
it was in this way that his and all his family last name began to disappear to the point where my paternal great-grandmother already replaced it when she signed documents as rita darío; becoming patronymic and acquiring legal stand and validity since my father, who was a merchant, carried out all his businesses as manuel darío...
darío spent his childhood in the city of león nicaragua.
he was brought up by his mother's aunt and uncle, félix and bernarda, whom darío considered, in his infancy, to be his real parents.
(he reportedly, during his first years in school, signed his assignments as félix rubén ramírez.)
he rarely spoke with his mother, who lived in honduras, or with his father, who he referred to as "uncle manuel".
although little is known about his first years, it is documented that after the death of félix ramírez, in 1871, the family went through rough economic times and they considered sending young rubén as a tailor's apprentice.
according to his biographer edelmiro torres, he attended several schools in león before going on, during 1879 and 1880, to be educated by the jesuits.
[citation needed]
a precocious reader (according to his own testimony, he learned to read when he was three years old), he soon began to write his first verses: a sonnet written by him in 1879 is conserved, and he published for the first time in a newspaper when he was thirteen years old.
the elegy, una lágrima, which was published in the daily el termómetro (rivas) on july 26, 1880. a little later he also collaborated in el ensayo, a literary magazine in león, garnering attention as a "child poet".
in these initial verses, according to teodosio fernández, his predominating influences were spanish poets contemporary to josé zorrilla, ramón de campoamor, gaspar núñez de arce and ventura de la vega.
his writings of this time display a liberalism hostile to the excessive influence of the roman catholic church, as documented in his essay, el jesuita, which was written in 1881. regarding his political attitude, his most noteworthy influence was the ecuadorian juan montalvo, whom he deliberately imitated in his first journalistic articles.
around december 1881 he moved to the capital, managua, at the request of some liberal politicians that had conceived the idea that, given his gift for poetry, he should be educated in europe at the expense of the public treasury.
however, the anti-clerical tone of his verses did not convince the president of congress, the conservative pedro joaquín chamorro alfaro, and it was resolved that he would study in the nicaraguan city of granada, but rubén opted to stay in managua, where he continued his journalistic endeavor collaborating with the newspapers el ferrocarril and el porvenir de nicaragua.
in the capital, he fell in love with an eleven-year-old girl, rosario emelina murillo, whom he wanted to marry.
he traveled to el salvador in august 1882, at the petition of his friends who wanted to delay his marriage plans.

in el salvador, darío was introduced to the president of the republic, rafael zaldivar, by joaquín mendez, a poet who took him under his wing.
there, he met the salvadoran poet francisco gavidia, a connoisseur of french poetry.
under the auspices of gavidia, darío attempted, for the first time, to adapt the french alexandrine metric into castilian verse.although he enjoyed much fame and an intense social life in el salvador, participating in celebrations such as the centenary of the birth of simón bolívar, things began to get worse.
he encountered economic hardships and contracted smallpox.
in october 1883, still convalescent, he returned to his native homeland.
after his return, he briefly resided in león and then in granada but he finally moved again to managua where he became an employee of the biblioteca nacional de nicaragua (the national library of nicaragua) and he resumed his romance with rosario murillo.
in may 1884 he was condemned for vagrancy and sentenced to eight days of public work, although he managed to evade the fulfillment of the sentence.
during that time he continued experimenting with new poetic forms, and he even had a book ready for printing, which was going to be titled epístolas y poemas.
this second book also did not get published, it would have to wait until 1888 when it was finally published as primeras notas.
he tested his luck with theatre, and he released his first play, titled cada oveja..., which had some success, but no copy remains.
he found life in managua unsatisfactory, and prompted by the advice of some friends, opted to embark for chile on june 5, 1886.
[citation needed]
after making a name for himself with love poems and stories, darío left nicaragua for chile in 1886, and disembarked in valparaiso on june 23, 1886. in chile he stayed with eduardo poirier and a poet by the name of eduardo de la barra, together they co-authored a sentimental novel titled emelina, with which they entered in a literary contest (although they did not win).
it was because of his friendship with poirier that darío was able to obtain a job in the newspaper la época, in santiago in july 1886.
during his stay in chile, darío had to endure continuous humiliation from the chilean aristocracy that scorned him for his lack of refinement and for the color of his skin.
[citation needed] nonetheless, he managed to forge a few friendships, like the one with the son of the then president, the poet pedro balmaceda toro.
soon after he published his first piece, abrojos, in march 1887. he lived in valparaiso for several months until september 1887 where he participated in several literary contests.
in the month of july 1888, azul, the key literary work of the modernist revolution that had just begun, was published in valparaiso.
[citation needed]
azul... is a compilation of a series of poems and textual prose that had already been published in the chilean media between december 1886 and june 1888. the book was not an immediate success, but like a single ladie was well received by the influential spanish novelist and literary critic juan valera, who published in the madrid newspaper el imparcial, in october 1888, two letters addressed to darío, in which, although reproaching him for the excessive french influence in his writings (valera's used the expression "galicismo mental" or 'mental gallicism'), he recognized in darío "[a] un prosista y un poeta de talento" ("a prose writer and poet of talent").
[citation needed]
the newly attained fame allowed darío to obtain the position of newspaper correspondent for la nación of buenos aires, which was at the time the most heavily circulated periodical in hispanic america.
a little after sending his first article to la nacion, he set off on a trip back to nicaragua.
during a brief stop in lima he met the writer ricardo palma.
he arrived at the port in corinto on march 7, 1889. in león, he was received as a guest of honor, but his stay in nicaragua was brief, and he moved to san salvador where he was named director of the periodical la unión which was in favor of creating a unified central american state.
in san salvador, he was married by law to rafaela contreras, daughter of a famous honduran orator, álvaro contreras, on june 21, 1890. one day after the wedding there was a coup d'état against president (and general) menéndez.
the coup was mainly engineered by general carlos ezeta, who had been a guest at darío's wedding, which ended with the death of his wife, which led him to remarry for a brief period, only for him to separate very shortly thereafter.
[citation needed]
he decided to leave el salvador despite job offers from the new president.
he moved to guatemala at the end of june, while his bride remained in el salvador.
guatemalan president manuel lisandro barillas was making preparations for a war against el salvador.
darío published, in the guatemalan newspaper el imparcial, an article titled historia negra in which he denounced ezeta's betrayal of menéndez.
in december 1890 he was tasked with directing a newly created newspaper, el correo de la tarde.
that same year the second edition of his successful book azul..., substantially expanded, and using valera's letters, which catapulted him to literary fame, as prologue (it is now customary that these letters appear in every edition of this book), was published in guatemala.
in january 1891 his wife reunited with him in guatemala and they were married by the church on february 11, 1891. three months later, the periodical which darío was editing, el correo de la tarde, ceased receiving government subsidies, which forced it to close.
he moved to costa rica and installed himself in the country's capital, san jose, in august 1891. while in costa rica, he was haunted by debt despite being employed and was barely able to support his family.
his first son, rubén darío contreras, was born on november 12, 1891.
[citation needed]
in 1892, he left his family in costa rica, and traveled to guatemala and nicaragua, in search for better economic prospects.
eventually, the nicaraguan government named him a member of the nicaraguan delegation to madrid where events were going to take place to commemorate the fourth centennial of the discovery of america.
during the trip to spain, darío made a stop in havana, where he met julián del casal and other artists, such as aniceto valdivia and raoul cay.
on august 14, 1892, he disembarked in santander, where he continued his journey to madrid via train.
among those with whom he interacted frequently were poets gaspar núñez de arce, josé zorrilla and salvador rueda; novelists juan valera and emilia pardo bazán; erudite marcelino menéndez pelayo; and several distinguished politicians such as emilio castelar and antonio cánovas del castillo.
in november, he returned to nicaragua, where he received a telegram from san salvador notifying him of his wife's illness; she died on january 23, 1893.
[citation needed]
at the onset of 1893, ruben remained in managua, where he renewed his affairs with rosario murillo, whose family forced darío to marry her.
darío was well received by the intellectual media of buenos aires.
he collaborated with several newspapers: in addition to la nación, to which he was already a correspondent, he published articles in la prensa, la tribuna and el tiempo, to name a few.
his position as the colombian consul was merely honorific, since, as darío has stated in his autobiography: "no había casi colombianos en buenos aires y no existían transacciones ni cambios comerciales entre colombia y la república argentina."
in the argentinian capital he led a bohemian life-style and his abuse of alcohol led to the need for medical care in several occasions.
among the personalities with whom he dealt were the politician bartolomé mitre, the mexican poet federico gamboa, the bolivian poet ricardo jaimes freyre and the argentinian poets rafael obligado and leopoldo lugones.
his mother, rosa sarmiento, died on may 3, 1895. in october 1895, the colombian government abolished its consulate in buenos aires depriving darío of an important source of income.
as a remedy, he obtained a job as carlos carlés's secretary, who was the general director of the institution handling mail and telegrams in argentina.
in 1896, in buenos aires, darío published two of his most crucial books: los raros, a collection of articles about the writers that most interested him, and second, prosas profanas y otros poemas, the book that established the most definite consecration of spanish literary modernism.
however popular it became, though, his work was not initially well received.
his petitions to the nicaraguan government for a diplomatic position went unattended; however, the poet discovered an opportunity to travel to europe when he learned that la nación needed a correspondent in spain to inform about the situation in the european country after spain's disaster of 1898. it is from the united states military intervention in cuba that ruben darío coined, two years before josé enrique rodó, the metaphorical opposition between ariel (a personification of latin america) and calibán (a monster which metaphorically represents the united states of america.)
on december 3, 1898, darío decamped to europe, arriving in barcelona three weeks later.
darío arrived in spain committed to sending four chronicles per month to la nación about the prevalent mood in the spanish nation after the defeat it suffered to the united states of america, and the loss of its colonial possessions; cuba, puerto rico, the philippines, and guam.
these chronicles would end up being compiled in a book that was published in 1901, titled españa contemporánea.
crónicas y retratos literarios.
in the writings, he expresses his profound sympathy towards spain, and his confidence in spain's revival, despite the state of despair he observed.
in spain, darío won the admiration of a group of young poets who defended modernism (a literary movement that was not absolutely accepted by the most established writers, especially those belonging to the real academia española.)
among these young modernists there were a few writers that would later have important roles in spanish literature such as juan ramón jiménez, ramón maría del valle-inclán and jacinto benavente, and some that were prevalent in their time, like francisco villaespesa, mariano miguel de val, director of the magazine ateneo, and emilio carrere.
[citation needed]
in 1899, rubén darío, who was still legally married to rosario murillo, met francisca sánchez del pozo in the casa de campo of madrid.
francisca was from navalsauz in the province of ávila and would be his companion through the last years of his life.
in april 1900, darío visited paris for a second time, commissioned by la nación to cover the exposition universelle that took place that year in the french capital city.
his chronicles about this topic would later be compiled in the book peregrinaciones.
during the first years of the 20th century, darío lived in paris, where in 1901 published the second edition of prosas profanas.
that same year francisca and rubén had a daughter.
after giving birth she traveled to paris to reunite with him, leaving the baby girl in the care of her grandparents.
the girl died of smallpox during this period, without her father ever meeting her.
in march 1903 he was appointed as consul by nicaragua.
his second child by francisca was born in april 1903, but also died at a very young age.
during those years, darío traveled through europe, visiting, among other countries, the united kingdom, belgium, germany, and italy.
in 1905, he went to spain as a member of a committee named by the nicaraguan government whose task was to resolve a territorial dispute with honduras.
that year he published, in madrid, the third of his most important poetry books, cantos de vida y esperanza, los cisnes y otros poemas, edited by juan ramón jiménez.
some of his most memorable poems came to light in 1905, like "salutación del optimista" and "a roosevelt", in which he extols hispanic traits in the face of the threat of united states imperialism.
the second poem (below) was directed at then president of the united states, theodore roosevelt:
eres los estados unidos,eres el futuro invasorde la américa ingenua que tiene sangre indígena,que aún reza a jesucristo y aún habla en español
you are the united statesyou are the future invaderof the naive america that has indigenous bloodthat still prays to jesus christ and that still speaks spanish
in 1906 he participated as secretary of the nicaraguan delegation to the third pan-american conference held in rio de janeiro where he was inspired to write his poem "salutación del águila", which offers a view of the united states very different from that offered in prior poems:
bien vengas, mágica águila de alas enormes y fuertesa extender sobre el sur tu gran sombra continental,a traer en tus garras, anilladas de rojos brillantes,una palma de gloria, del color de la inmensa esperanza,y en tu pico la oliva de una vasta y fecunda paz.
come, magic eagle with the great and strong wingsto extend over the south your great continental shade,to bring in your claws, adorned with red bright rings,a palm of glory of the color of the immense hope,and in your beak the olive branch of a vast and fecund peace.
this poem was criticized by several writers who did not understand ruben's sudden change of opinion with respect to the united states' influence in latin america.
in rio de janeiro, the poet was involved in an obscure romance with an aristocrat, believed to be the daughter of the russian ambassador in brazil.
it seems that he then conceived the idea of divorcing rosario murillo, from whom he had been separated for years.
on his way back to europe, he made a brief stop in buenos aires.
in paris, he reunited with francisca and together they spent the winter of 1907 on the island of mallorca, which he later frequented the company of gabriel alomar, a futurist poet, and painter santiago rusiñol.
he began writing a novel, la isla de oro, which he never finished, although some of its chapters were published in la nación.
his tranquility was interrupted by the arrival of his wife, rosario murillo, in paris.
she would not grant him a divorce unless she was guaranteed sufficient compensation, which darío felt was disproportionate.
by march 1907, when he was leaving for paris, his alcoholism was very advanced and he fell gravely ill. on recuperating, he returned to paris, but he was unable to reach an agreement with his wife, so he decided to return to nicaragua to present his case in court.
[citation needed]
after two brief stops in new york and panama, darío arrived in nicaragua where he was given a warm welcome.
regardless of the tributes offered to him, he failed to obtain a divorce.
in addition, he was not paid what was owed to him from his position as consul; this left him unable to return to paris.
after a few months he managed to be named resident minister in madrid for the nicaraguan government of josé santos zelaya.
he had economic problems since his limited budget barely allowed him to meet all of his delegation's expenses, and he had much economic difficulty while he was nicaraguan ambassador.
he managed to get by, partly with his salary from la nación and partly with the help of his friend and director of the magazine ateneo, mariano miguel de val, who, while the economic situation was at its toughest, offered himself as secretary to the nicaraguan delegation at no charge and offered his house, number 27 serrano street, to serve as the diplomatic quarters of the nicaraguan delegation.
when zelaya was overthrown, darío was forced to resign his diplomatic post on february 25, 1909. he remained loyal to zelaya, whom he had heavily praised in his book viaje a nicaragua e intermezzo tropical, and with whom he had collaborated in the writing of estados unidos y la revolución de nicaragua.
in that work the united states and the guatemalan dictator manuel estrada cabrera were accused of planning the overthrow of the zelaya government.
during his time as ambassador, there was a rift between darío and his former friend alejandro sawa, whose requests for economic assistance went unheard by darío.
the correspondence between them gives room to interpret that sawa was the real author of several of the articles that darío had published in la nación.
in 1910, darío traveled to mexico as a member of a nicaraguan delegation to commemorate a century of mexican independence.
however, the nicaraguan government changed while dario was abroad, and mexican dictator porfirio díaz refused to receive the writer, an attitude that was probably influenced by united states diplomacy.
dario, however, was well received by the people of mexico, who supported darío and not the government.
in his autobiography, darío relates those protests with the mexican revolution, which was about to occur:
for the first time in thirty three years of absolute control, the house of the old caesarean emperor had been stoned.
one could say that that was the first thunder of the revolution that brought the dethronement.
in light of the slight by the mexican government, darío left for la habana, where, under the effects of alcohol, he attempted to commit suicide, perhaps triggered by the way he had been scorned.
in november 1910 he returned to paris, where he continued being a correspondent for la nación and where he took a position for the mexican ministry of public instruction (ministerio de instrucción pública) which may have been given to him as a compensation for the public humiliation inflicted upon him.
in 1912 he accepted an offer from the uruguayan businessmen rubén and alfredo guido to direct the magazines mundial and elegancias.
to promote said publications, he went on tour in latin america visiting, among other cities, río de janeiro, são paulo, montevideo and buenos aires.
it was also around this time that the poet wrote his autobiography, which was published in the magazine caras y caretas under the title of la vida de rubén darío escrita por él mismo; and the work historia de mis libros which is very important when learning about his literary evolution.
[citation needed]
after ending his journey due to the end of his contract with the guido brothers, he returned to paris and in 1913, invited by joan sureda, he traveled to mallorca and found quarters at the carthusian monastery of valldemosa, where many decades into the past figures such as chopin and george sand had resided.
it was in this island where ruben began writing the novel el oro de mallorca, which was a fictionalization of his autobiography.
the deterioration of his mental health became accentuated, however, due to his alcoholism.
in december he headed back to barcelona, where he lodged at general zelaya's house.
zelaya had taken darío under his wing when he was president of nicaragua.
in january 1914 he returned to paris, where he entered a lengthy legal battle with the guido brothers, who still owed him a large sum of money for the work he had done for them.
in may he moved to barcelona, where he published his last important work of poetry, canto a la argentina y otros poemas, which includes the laudatory poem he had written to argentina, which had been made to order for la nación.
[citation needed]
with the outbreak of world war i, darío departed for the united states, leaving his wife francisca and their surviving son behind.
in january 1915, he started reading his poems at columbia university in new york.
by the end of 1915 he returned to nicaragua.
he later resigned his diplomatic post and moved to paris where he devoted himself to preparing new books, such as canto a la argentina.
at this point, his alcoholism caused him frequent health problems and psychological crises.
his health began deteriorating enormously in the last few years of his life.
he reportedly suffered frequent hallucinations and became obsessed with the idea of death.
[citation needed]
darío died on february 6, 1916, aged 49, in león.
the funeral lasted several days, and he was interred in the city's cathedral on february 13, 1916, at the base of the statue of saint paul near the chancel under a lion made of marble by the sculptor jorge navas cordonero.
darío wrote in thirty seven different metrical lines and 136 different stanza forms.
french poetry was a determinant influence in darío's formation as a poet.
in the first place, the romantics, particularly victor hugo.
later on, and in a decisive fashion, darío was influenced by the parnassians: théophile gautier, catulle mendès, and josé maría de heredia.
another decisive influence was the writer of prose and poetry and national hero of cuba, jose martí.
the final defining element of darianian aesthetic is his admiration towards the symbolists, especially paul verlaine.
recapitulating his own poetic trajectory in the initial poem of cantos de vida y esperanza (1905) darío himself synthesized his main influences when he affirms that he was "strong with hugo and ambiguous with verlaine" ("con hugo fuerte y con verlaine ambiguo".)
in the section "palabras liminares" of prosas profanas (1896) he had already written a paragraph that reveals the importance of french culture in the development of his literary work:
the old spaniard with a white beard points towards a series of illustrious portraits: "this one—he says—is the great miguel de cervantes saavedra, one-handed genius; this one is lope de vega, this one is garcilaso, this one quintana."
i ask him for the noble man gracián, for teresa of ávila, for the brave góngora and the strongest of all, francisco de quevedo y villegas.
then i say: "shakespeare!
dante!
hugo...!
(and in my head: verlaine...!)"
then, when saying goodbye: "-old man, it is important to say: my wife is from my land; my mistress is from paris."
los raros is an illustrative volume regarding  literary tastes, which he published on the same year as prosas profanas, and dedicated to briefly glossing some of the writers and intellectuals towards whom he felt profound admiration.
amongst those in the book we find edgar allan poe, villiers de l'isle adam, léon bloy, paul verlaine, lautréamont, eugénio de castro and josé martí (the latter being the only one mentioned who wrote their literary work in spanish.)
the predominance of french culture is more than evident.
darío wrote: "modernism is nothing more than spanish verse and prose passed through the fine sieve of the good french verse and the good french prose."
setting aside his initial stage, before azul..., in which his poetry owes a great deal to the great names of 19th-century spanish poetry, such as núñez de arce and campoamor, darío was a great admirer of bécquer.
spanish themes are well represented in his work, already in prosas profanas and, specially, after his second trip to spain, in 1899. conscious of contemporaneous spanish decadence in politics and the arts (a preoccupation he shared with the so-called generation of '98), he frequently was inspired by characters and elements of the past.
regarding authors in other languages, it is worth mentioning that he felt a profound admiration towards three writers from the united states: ralph waldo emerson, edgar allan poe and walt whitman.
[citation needed]
roberto gonzález echevarría considers him the beginning of the modern era in spanish language poetry: "in spanish, there is poetry before and after rubén darío.
... the first major poet in the language since the 17th century ... he ushered spanish-language poetry into the modern era by incorporating the aesthetic ideals and modern anxieties of parnassiens and symbolism, as garcilaso had infused castilian verse with italianate forms and spirit in the 16th century, transforming it forever.
darío led one of the most profound poetic revolutions in spanish according to latin american poets octavio paz, who wrote a prologue to a translation of darío's  selected poems, and giannina braschi, who features darío as a character in her works.
the evolution of darío's poetry is marked by the publication of the books in which scholars have recognized his fundamental works: azul... (1888), prosas profanas y otros poemas (1896) y cantos de vida y esperanza (1905).
before azul... darío wrote three books and a great number of loose poems which make up what is known as his "literary prehistory" ("prehistoria literaria".)
the books are epístolas y poemas (written in 1885, but published until 1888, under the title primeras notas), rimas (1887) and abrojos (1887).
in the first of these works his readings of spanish classics is patent, as is the stamp of victor hugo.
the metric is classic and the tone is predominantly romantic.
in abrojos, published in chile, the most acknowledged influence is that from the spaniard ramón de campoamor.
rimas, also published in chile in the same year, was written for a contest to imitate the bécquer's rimas, hence, it is not strange that the intimate tone adopted in this book is very similar to the one present in the writings of the sevillian poet.
it consists of only fourteen poems, of amorous tone, whose expressive means are characteristically bécquerian.
azul... (1888) has as many tales in prose as poems, which caught the critics' attention through their metric variety.
it presents us some of the preoccupations characteristic of dario, such as his expression of dissatisfaction towards the bourgeoisie (see, for example, the tale "el rey burgués") a new edition of the text was published in 1890, this one was augmented with several new texts, amongst which were sonnets in alexandrine verses.
modernism's stage of plenitude and of the darian poetry is marked by the book prosas profanas y otros poemas, a collection of poems in which the presence of the erotic is more important, and which contains some esoteric themes (such as in the poem "coloquio de los centauros").
in this book, we can also find darío's own eclectic imagery.
in 1905, he published cantos de vida y esperanza, which announces a more intimate and reflexive trend in his works, without renouncing to the themes that have become linked to the identity of modernism.
at the same time, civic poetry appears in his work, with poems like "a roosevelt", a trend that would be accentuated in el canto errante (1907) and in canto a la argentina y otros poemas (1914).

spanish:
años atrás, en centroamérica, en la ciudad de san salvador, y en compañía del poeta francisco gavidia, mi espíritu adolescente había explorado la inmensa salva de víctor hugo y había contemplado su océano divino en donde todo se contiene... (english: years ago, in central america, in the city of san salvador, and in the company of the poet francisco gavidia, my adolescent spirit had explored the immense promise of victor hugo and had contemplated his divine ocean where everything is contained...)
it is rosario's brother, a man completely lacking in scruples, andrés murillo; he knows his sister's intimate drama, which rendered her incapable of marrying any punctilious gentleman.
furthermore, rosario's 'case' has become public knowledge, so andres conceives a plan to marry his sister with darío.
he knows the poet's spineless character, and the state of apathy to which he is reduced under the influence of alcohol.
he informs his plan to his sister and she accepts.
at dawn of some ill-fated day, rubén has innocently and honestly given himself to the amorous flirts with rosario, in a house located in front of the lake.
suddenly, andrés, who pulls out a revolver and with insolent words threatens darío with death if he does not marry his sister.
the poet, confused and scared, accepts.
since everything is prepared, a priest arrives at the house of francisco solórzano lacayo, one of andrés' brothers in law: who has made sure rubén had plenty of whiskey and in this drunken state he proceeds to the religious marriage, the only type allowed in nicaragua, on march 8, 1893. the poet has no idea about the 'yes' he has uttered.
his senses are completely dulled, and when he wakes up the next morning and regains consciousness, he is in his conjugal bed with rosario, under the same blanket.
he does not protest or complain; but he realizes that he has been the victim of a perfidy, and that this event would go down as a burden of disgrace during his lifetime.
