depicted as if rippling in a strong sea breeze.", "similar traits can be seen in the laoco\u00f6n group which is a reworked copy of a lost original that was likely close both in time and place of

250 bc or as late as 180. certainly, the parallels with figures and drapery from the pergamon altar (dated about 170 bc) seem strong.", "the evidence for a rhodian commission of the statue has been questioned, however, and the closest artistic parallel to the nike of samothrace are figures depicted on macedonian coins.", "samothrace was an important sanctuary for the hellenistic macedonian

individual pieces of the sculpture to date.", "the restoration aimed to restore the marble to its original hue which had been tarnished by time.", "the sculpture was removed from its base and carried into an adjoining room which was transformed for the occasion into a restoration workshop.", "the base was dismantled block by block and placed in the workshop.", "scientific reviews were performed on the base (uv, infrared, x-ray spectroscopy) prior to cleaning the surface of the marble.", "this effort aimed to respect the goals of the original restoration performed in 1883. the surface of the base was cleaned and then reassembled, and some gaps in the marble were repaired.", "upon completion of the restoration, the statue was reunited with its base and returned to its prior position at the head of the daru staircase in the louvre.", "despite its significant damage and incompleteness, the victory is held to be one of the great surviving masterpieces of sculpture from the hellenistic period, and from the entire greco-roman era.", "the statue shows a mastery of form and movement which has impressed critics and artists since its discovery.", "it is considered one of the louvre's greatest treasures, and since the late 19th century it has been displayed in the most dramatic fashion, at the head of the sweeping daru staircase.", "the art historian h. w. janson has pointed out that unlike earlier greek or near eastern sculptures, nike creates a deliberate relationship to the imaginary space around the goddess.", "the wind that has carried her and which she is fighting off, straining to keep steady \u2013 as mentioned the original mounting had her standing on a ship's prow, just having landed \u2013 is the invisible complement of the figure and the viewer is made to imagine it.", "at the same time, this expanded space heightens the symbolic force of the work; the wind and the sea are suggested as metaphors of struggle, destiny and divine help or grace.", "this kind of interplay between a statue and the space conjured up would become a common device in baroque and romantic art, about two thousand years later.", "it is present in michelangelo's sculpture of david: david's gaze and pose shows where he is seeing his adversary goliath and his awareness of the moment \u2013 but it is rare in ancient art.", "the victory soon became a cultural icon to which

white minority had produced 80% of the country's exports and were a vital part of its economy, yet between 1962 and 1963 they were emigrating at a rate of 700 a month; kenyatta feared that this white exodus would cause a brain drain and skills shortage that would be detrimental to the economy.", "he was also aware that the confidence of the white minority would be crucial to securing western investment in kenya's economy.", "kenyatta made it clear that when in power, he would not sack any white civil servants unless there were competent black individuals capable of replacing them.", "he

interests and denied equal opportunities across kenya; they also insisted on an elected head of government.", "at kenyatta's prompting, kanu conceded to some of kadu's demands; he was aware that he could amend the constitution when in office.", "the new constitution divided kenya into six regions, each with a regional assembly, but also featured a strong central government and both an upper and a lower house.", "it was agreed that a temporary coalition government would be established until independence, several kanu politicians being given ministerial posts.", "kenyatta accepted a minor position, that of the minister of state for constitutional affairs and economic planning.", "the british government considered renison too ill at ease with indigenous africans to oversee the transition to independence and thus replaced him with malcolm macdonald as governor of kenya in january 1963. macdonald and kenyatta developed a strong friendship; the briton referred to the latter as \"the wisest and perhaps strongest as well as most popular potential prime minister of the independent nation to be\".", "macdonald sped up plans for kenyan independence, believing that the longer the wait, the greater the opportunity for radicalisation among african nationalists.", "an election was scheduled for may, with self-government in june, followed by full independence in december.", "the

african federation, agreeing that this would be accomplished by the end of the year.", "privately, kenyatta was more reluctant regarding the arrangement and as 1964 came around the federation had not come to pass.", "many radical voices in kenya urged him to pursue the project; in may 1964, kenyatta rejected a back-benchers resolution calling for speedier federation.", "he publicly stated that talk of a federation had always been a ruse to hasten the pace of kenyan independence from britain, but nyerere denied that this was true.", "continuing to emphasise good relations with the white settlers, in august 1963 kenyatta met with 300 white farmers at nakuru.", "he reassured them that they would be safe and welcome in an independent kenya, and more broadly talked of forgiving and forgetting the conflicts of the past.", "despite his attempts at wooing white support, he did not do the same with the indian minority.", "like many indigenous africans in kenya, kenyatta bore a sense of resentment towards this community, despite the role that many indians had played in securing the country's independence.", "he also encouraged the remaining mau mau fighters to leave the forests

district (nfd) continued; for much of kenyatta's rule, somalia remained the major threat to his government.", "to deal with sporadic violence in the region by somali shifta guerrillas, kenyatta sent soldiers into the region in december 1963 and gave them broad powers of arrest and seizure in the nfd in september 1964. british troops were assigned to assist the kenyan army in the region.",

country's important government and administrative positions.", "this contributed to a perception among many kenyans that independence had simply seen the dominance of a british elite replaced by the dominance of a kikuyu elite.", "kenyatta's calls to forgive and forget the past were a keystone of his government.", "he preserved some elements of the old colonial order, particularly in relation to law and order.", "the police and military structures were left largely intact.", "white kenyans were left in senior positions within the judiciary, civil service, and parliament, with the white kenyans bruce mackenzie and humphrey slade being among kenyatta's top officials.", "kenyatta's government nevertheless rejected the idea that the european and asian minorities could be permitted dual citizenship, expecting these communities to offer total loyalty to the independent kenyan state.", "his administration pressured whites-only social clubs to adopt multi-racial entry policies, and in 1964 schools formerly reserved for european pupils were opened to africans and asians.", "kenyatta's government believed it necessary to cultivate a united kenyan national culture.", "to this end, it

there was a heavy reliance on exporting primary goods while importing capital and manufactured goods.", "under kenyatta, the structure of this economy did not fundamentally change, remaining externally oriented and dominated by multinational corporations and foreign capital.", "kenyatta's economic policy was capitalist and entrepreneurial, with no serious socialist policies being pursued; its focus was on achieving economic growth as opposed to equitable redistribution.", "the government passed laws to encourage foreign investment, recognising that kenya needed foreign-trained specialists in scientific and technical fields to aid its economic development.", "under kenyatta, western companies regarded kenya as a safe and profitable place for investment; between 1964 and

equitable distribution of economic and social development.", "in 1965, when thomas mboya was minister for economic planning and development, the government issued a session paper titled \"african socialism and its application to planning in kenya\", in which it officially declared its commitment to what it called an \"african socialist\" economic model.", "the session proposed a mixed economy

highlighted that the image of \"african socialism\" portrayed in the document provided for no major shift away from the colonial economy.", "kenya's agricultural and industrial sectors were dominated by europeans and its commerce and trade by asians; one of kenyatta's most pressing issues was to bring the economy under indigenous control.", "there was growing black resentment towards the asian domination of the small business sector, with kenyatta's government putting pressure on asian-owned businesses, intending to replace them with african-owned counterparts.", "the 1965 session paper

deep emotional resonance in kenya, having been a major grievance against the british colonialists.", "as part of the lancaster house negotiations, britain's government agreed to provide kenya with \u00a327 million with which to buy out white farmers and redistribute their land among the indigenous population.", "to ease this transition, kenyatta made mckenzie, a white farmer, the minister of agriculture and land.", "kenyatta's government encouraged the establishment of private land-buying companies that were often headed by prominent politicians.", "the government sold or leased lands in the former white highlands to these companies, which in turn subdivided them among individual shareholders.", "in this way, the land redistribution programs favoured the ruling party's chief constituency.", "kenyatta himself expanded the land that he owned around gatundu.", "kenyans who made claims to land on the basis of ancestral ownership often found the land given to other people,

expansion of the indigenous middle class in kenyatta's kenya.", "the government oversaw a massive expansion in education facilities.", "in june 1963, kenyatta ordered the ominda commission to determine a framework for meeting kenya's educational needs.", "their report set out the long-term goal of universal free primary education in kenya but argued that the government's emphasis should be

services for out-patients and children.", "by kenyatta's death, the majority of kenyans had access to significantly better healthcare than they had had in the colonial period.", "before independence, the average life expectancy in kenya was 45, but by the end of the 1970s it was 55, the second highest in sub-saharan africa.", "this improved medical care had resulted in declining mortality rates while birth rates remained high, resulting in a rapidly growing population; from 1962 to 1979, kenya's population grew by just under 4% a year, the highest rate in the world at the time.", "this put a severe strain on social services; kenyatta's government promoted family planning projects to stem the birth-rate, but these had little success.", "in part due to his advanced years, kenyatta rarely travelled outside of eastern africa.", "under kenyatta, kenya was largely uninvolved in the affairs of other states, including those in the east african community.", "despite his reservations about

conference, he was assaulted by martin webster, a british neo-nazi.", "kenyatta's relationship with the united states was also warm; the united states agency for international development played a key role in helping respond to a maize shortage in kambaland in 1965. kenyatta also maintained a warm relationship with israel, including when other east african nations endorsed arab hostility to the state; he for instance permitted israeli jets to refuel in kenya on their way back from the entebbe raid.", "in turn, in 1976 the israelis warned of a plot by the palestinian liberation army to assassinate him, a threat he took seriously.", "kenyatta and his government were anti-communist, and in june 1965 he warned that \"it is naive to think that there is no danger of imperialism from the

front for soviet influence in kenya.", "kenyatta made clear his desire for kenya to become a one-party state, regarding this as a better expression of national unity than a multi-party system.", "in the first five years of independence, he consolidated control of the central government, removing the autonomy of kenya's provinces to prevent the entrenchment of ethnic power bases.", "he argued that centralised control of the government was needed to deal with the growth in demands for local services and to assist quicker economic development.", "in 1966, it launched a commission to examine reforms to local government operations, and in 1969 passed the transfer of functions act, which terminated grants to local authorities and transferred major services from provincial to central control.", "a major focus for kenyatta during the first three and a half years of kenya's independence were the divisions within kanu itself.", "opposition to kenyatta's government grew, particularly following the assassination of pio pinto in february 1965. kenyatta condemned the assassination of the prominent leftist politician, although uk intelligence agencies believed that his own bodyguard had orchestrated the murder.", "relations between kenyatta and odinga were strained, and at the march 1966 party conference, odinga's post\u2014that of party vice president\u2014was divided among eight different politicians, greatly limiting his power and ending his position as kenyatta's automatic successor.", "between 1964 and 1966, kenyatta and other kanu conservatives had been deliberately trying to push odinga to resign from the party.", "under growing pressure, in 1966 odinga stepped down as state vice president, claiming that kenya had failed to achieve economic independence and needed to adopt socialist policies.", "backed by several other senior kanu figures and trade unionists, he became head of the new kenya peoples union (kpu).", "in its manifesto, the kpu stated that it would pursue \"truly socialist policies\" like the nationalisation of public utilities; it claimed kenyatta's government \"want[ed] to build a capitalist system in the image of western capitalism but are too embarrassed or dishonest to call it that.\"", "the kpu were legally recognised as the official opposition, thus restoring the country's two party system.", "the new party was a direct challenge to kenyatta's rule, and he regarded it as a communist-inspired plot to oust him.", "soon after the kpu's creation, the kenyan parliament amended the constitution to ensure that the defectors\u2014who had originally been elected on the kanu ticket\u2014could not automatically retain their seats and would have to stand for re-election.", "this resulted in the election of june 1966. the luo increasingly rallied around the kpu, which experienced localized violence that hindered its ability to campaign, although kenyatta's government officially disavowed this violence.", "kanu retained the support of all national newspapers and the government-owned radio and television stations.", "of the 29 defectors, only 9\u00a0were re-elected on the kpu ticket; odinga was among

kikuyu cultural tradition in which individuals came to gatundu to swear their loyalty to him.", "journalists were discouraged from reporting on the oathing system, and several were deported when they tried to do so.", "many kenyans were pressured or forced to swear oaths, something condemned by the country's christian establishment.", "in response to the growing condemnation, the oathing was terminated in september 1969, and kenyatta invited leaders from other ethnic groups to a meeting in gatundu.", "kenyatta's government resorted to un-democratic measures to restrict the opposition.",
