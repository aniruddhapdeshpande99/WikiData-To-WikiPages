opposing fletches are often cock feathers, and occasionally the fletches are not evenly spaced.", "the fletching may be either parabolic cut (short feathers in a smooth parabolic curve) or shield cut (generally shaped like half of a narrow shield), and is often attached at an angle, known as helical fletching, to introduce a stabilizing spin to the arrow while in flight.", "whether helical or straight fletched, when natural fletching (bird feathers) is used it is critical that all feathers come from the same side of the bird.", "oversized fletchings can be used to accentuate drag and thus

style.", "the archer holds the bow arm outwards, toward the target.", "the elbow of this arm should be rotated so that the inner elbow is perpendicular to the ground, though archers with hyper

archer stands erect, forming a \"t\".", "the archer's lower trapezius muscles are used to pull the arrow to the anchor point.", "some modern recurve bows are equipped with a mechanical device, called a clicker, which produces a clicking sound when the archer reaches the correct draw length.", "in contrast, traditional english longbow shooters step \"into the bow\", exerting force with both the bow

relaxing the fingers of the drawing hand (see bow draw), or triggering the mechanical release aid.", "usually the release aims to keep the drawing arm rigid, the bow hand relaxed, and the arrow is moved back using the back muscles, as opposed to using just arm motions.", "an archer should also pay attention to the recoil or follow through of his or her body, as it may indicate problems with form (technique) that affect accuracy.", "there are two main forms of aiming in archery: using a mechanical or fixed sight, or barebow.", "mechanical sights can be affixed to the bow to aid in aiming.", "they can be as simple as a pin, or may use optics with magnification.", "they usually also have a peep sight (rear sight) built into the string, which aids in a consistent anchor point.", "modern compound bows automatically limit the draw length to give a consistent arrow velocity, while traditional bows allow great variation in draw length.", "some bows use mechanical methods to make the draw length consistent.", "barebow archers often use a sight picture, which includes the target, the bow, the hand, the arrow shaft and the arrow tip, as seen at the same time by the archer.", "with a fixed \"anchor point\" (where the string is brought to, or close to, the face), and a fully extended bow arm, successive shots taken with the sight picture in the same position fall on the same point.", "this lets the archer adjust aim with successive shots to achieve accuracy.", "modern archery equipment usually includes sights.", "instinctive aiming is used by many archers who use traditional bows.", "the two most common forms of a non-mechanical release are split-finger and three-under.", "split-finger aiming requires the archer to place the index finger above the nocked arrow, while the middle and ring fingers are both placed below.", "three-under aiming places the index, middle, and ring fingers under the nocked arrow.", "this technique allows the archer to better look down the arrow since the back of the arrow is closer to the dominant eye, and is commonly called \"gun barreling\" (referring to common aiming techniques used with firearms).", "when using short bows or shooting from horseback, it is difficult to use the sight picture.", "the archer may look at the target, but without including the weapon in the field of accurate view.", "aiming then involves hand-eye coordination\u2014which includes proprioception and motor-muscle memory, similar to that used when throwing a ball.", "with sufficient practice, such archers can normally achieve good practical accuracy for hunting or for war.", "aiming without a sight picture may allow more rapid shooting, not however increasing accuracy.", "instinctive shooting is a style of shooting that includes the barebow aiming method that relies heavily upon the subconscious mind, proprioception, and motor/muscle memory to make aiming adjustments; the term used to refer to a general category of archers who did not use a mechanical or fixed sight.", "when a projectile is thrown by hand, the speed of the projectile is determined by the kinetic energy imparted by the thrower's muscles performing work.", "however, the energy must be imparted over a limited distance (determined by arm length) and therefore (because the projectile is accelerating) over a limited time, so the limiting factor is not work but rather power, which determined how much energy can be added in the limited time available.", "power generated by muscles, however, is limited by force\u2013velocity relationship, and even at the optimal contraction speed for power production, total work by the muscle is less than half of what it would be if the muscle contracted over the same distance at slow speeds, resulting in less than 1/4 the projectile launch velocity possible without the limitations of the force\u2013velocity relationship.", "when a bow is used, the muscles are able to perform work much more slowly, resulting in greater force and greater work done.", "this work is stored in the bow as elastic potential energy, and when the bowstring is released, this stored energy is imparted to the arrow much more quickly than can be delivered by the muscles, resulting in much higher velocity and, hence, greater distance.", "this same process is employed by frogs, which use elastic tendons to increase jumping distance.", "in archery, some energy dissipates through elastic hysteresis, reducing the overall amount released when the bow is shot.", "of the remaining energy, some is dampened both by the limbs of the bow and the bowstring.", "depending on the arrow's elasticity, some of the energy is also absorbed by compressing the arrow, primarily because the release of the bowstring is rarely in line with the arrow shaft, causing it to flex out to one side.", "this is because the bowstring accelerates faster than the archer's fingers can open, and consequently some sideways motion is imparted to the string, and hence arrow nock, as the power and speed of the bow pulls the string off the opening fingers.", "even with a release aid mechanism some of this effect is usually experienced, since the string always accelerates faster than the retaining part of the mechanism.", "this makes the arrow oscillate in flight\u2014its center flexing to one side and then the other repeatedly, gradually reducing as the arrow's flight proceeds.", "this is clearly visible in high-speed photography of arrows at discharge.", "a direct effect of these energy transfers can clearly be seen when dry firing.", "dry firing refers to releasing the bowstring without a nocked arrow.", "because there is no arrow to receive the stored potential energy, almost all the energy stays in the bow.", "some have suggested that dry firing may cause physical damage to the bow, such as cracks and fractures\u2014and because most bows are not specifically made to handle the high amounts of energy dry firing produces, should never be done.", "modern arrows are made to a specified 'spine', or stiffness rating, to maintain matched flexing and hence accuracy of aim.", "this flexing can be a desirable feature, since, when the spine of the shaft is matched to the acceleration of the bow(string), the arrow bends or flexes around the bow and any arrow-rest, and consequently the arrow, and fletchings, have an un-impeded flight.", "this feature is known as the archer's paradox.", "it maintains accuracy, for if part of the arrow struck a glancing blow on discharge, some inconsistency would be present, and the excellent accuracy of modern equipment would not be achieved.", "the accurate flight of an arrow depends on its fletchings.", "the arrow's manufacturer (a \"fletcher\") can arrange fletching to cause the arrow to rotate along its axis.", "this improves accuracy by evening pressure buildups that would otherwise cause the arrow to \"plane\" on the air in a random direction after shooting.", "even with a carefully made arrow, the slightest imperfection or air movement causes some unbalanced turbulence in air flow.", "consequently, rotation creates an equalization of such turbulence, which, overall, maintains the intended direction of flight i.e.", "accuracy.", "this rotation is not to be confused with the rapid gyroscopic rotation of a rifle bullet.", "fletching that is not arranged to induce rotation still improves accuracy by causing a restoring drag any time the arrow tilts from its intended direction of travel.", "the innovative aspect of the invention of the bow and arrow was the amount of power delivered to an extremely small area by the arrow.", "the huge ratio of length vs. cross sectional area, coupled with velocity, made the arrow more powerful than any other hand held weapon until firearms were invented.", "arrows can spread or concentrate force, depending on the application.", "practice arrows, for instance, have a blunt tip that spreads the force over a wider area to reduce the risk of injury or limit penetration.", "arrows designed to pierce armor in the middle ages used a very narrow and sharp tip (\"bodkinhead\") to concentrate the force.", "arrows used for hunting used a narrow tip (\"broadhead\") that widens further, to facilitate both penetration and a large wound.", "using archery to take game animals is known as \"bow hunting\".", "bow hunting differs markedly from hunting with firearms, as distance between hunter and prey must be much shorter to ensure a humane kill.", "the skills and practices of bow hunting therefore emphasize very close approach to the prey, whether by still hunting, stalking, or waiting in a blind or tree stand.", "in many countries, including much of the united states, bow hunting for large and small game is legal.", "bow hunters generally enjoy longer seasons than are allowed with other forms of hunting such as black powder, shotgun, or rifle.", "usually, compound bows are used for large game hunting due to the relatively short time it takes to master them as opposed to the longbow or recurve bow.", "these compound bows may feature fiber optic sights, stabilizers, and other
