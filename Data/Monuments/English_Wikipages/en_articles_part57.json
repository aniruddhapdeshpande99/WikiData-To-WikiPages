plays,[c] 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship.", "his plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright.", "shakespeare was born and raised in stratford-upon-avon, warwickshire.", "at the age of 18, he married anne hathaway, with whom he had three children: susanna and twins hamnet and judith.", "sometime between 1585 and 1592, he began a successful career in london as an actor, writer, and part-owner of a playing company called the lord chamberlain's men, later known as the king's men.", "at age 49 (around 1613), he appears to have retired to stratford, where he died three years later.", "few records of shakespeare's private life survive; this has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance, his sexuality, his religious beliefs, and whether the works attributed to him were written by others.", "shakespeare produced most of his known works between 1589 and 1613.", "[d] his early plays were primarily comedies and histories and are regarded as some of the best work produced in these genres.", "until about 1608, he wrote mainly tragedies, among them hamlet, othello, king lear, and macbeth, all considered to be among the finest works in the english language.", "in the last phase of his life, he wrote tragicomedies (also known as romances) and collaborated with other playwrights.", "many of shakespeare's plays were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy in his lifetime.", "however, in 1623, two fellow actors and friends of shakespeare's, john heminges and henry condell, published a more definitive text known as the first folio, a posthumous collected edition of shakespeare's dramatic works that included all but two of his plays.", "the volume was prefaced with a poem by ben jonson, in which jonson presciently hails shakespeare in a now-famous quote as \"not of an age, but for all time\".", "throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, shakespeare's works have been continually adapted and rediscovered by new movements in scholarship and performance.", "his plays remain popular and are studied, performed, and reinterpreted through various cultural and political contexts around the world.", "william shakespeare was the son of john shakespeare, an alderman and a successful glover (glove-maker) originally from snitterfield, and mary arden, the daughter of an affluent landowning farmer.", "he was born in stratford-upon-avon, where he was baptised on 26 april 1564. his date of birth is unknown, but is traditionally observed on 23 april, saint george's day.", "this date, which can be traced to a mistake made by an 18th-century scholar, has proved appealing to biographers because shakespeare died on the same date in 1616. he was the third of eight children, and the eldest surviving son.", "although no attendance records for the period survive, most biographers agree that shakespeare was probably educated at the king's new school in stratford, a free school chartered in 1553, about a quarter-mile (400\u00a0m) from his home.", "grammar schools varied in quality during the elizabethan era, but grammar school curricula were largely similar: the basic latin text was standardised by royal decree, and the school would have provided an intensive education in grammar based upon latin classical authors.", "at the age of 18, shakespeare married 26-year-old anne hathaway.", "the consistory court of the diocese of worcester issued a marriage licence on 27 november 1582. the next day, two of hathaway's neighbours posted bonds guaranteeing that no lawful claims impeded the marriage.", "the ceremony may have been arranged in some haste since the worcester chancellor allowed the marriage banns to be read once instead of the usual three times, and six months after the marriage anne gave birth to a daughter, susanna, baptised 26 may 1583.

birth of the twins, shakespeare left few historical traces until he is mentioned as part of the london theatre scene in 1592. the exception is the appearance of his name in the \"complaints bill\" of a law case before the queen's bench court at westminster dated michaelmas term 1588 and 9 october 1589. scholars refer to the years between 1585 and 1592 as shakespeare's \"lost years\".",

him.", "another 18th-century story has shakespeare starting his theatrical career minding the horses of theatre patrons in london.", "john aubrey reported that shakespeare had been a country schoolmaster.", "some 20th-century scholars have suggested that shakespeare may have been employed as a schoolmaster by alexander hoghton of lancashire, a catholic landowner who named a certain \"william shakeshafte\" in his will.", "little evidence substantiates such stories other than hearsay collected after his death, and shakeshafte was a common name in the lancashire area.", "it is not known definitively when shakespeare began writing, but contemporary allusions and records of performances show that several of his plays were on the london stage by 1592. by then, he was sufficiently known in london to be attacked in print by the playwright robert greene in his groats-worth of wit:", "...\u00a0there is an upstart crow, beautified with our feathers, that with his tiger's heart wrapped in a player's hide, supposes he is as well able to bombast out a blank verse as the best of you: and being an absolute johannes factotum, is in his own conceit the only shake-scene in a country.", "scholars differ on the exact meaning of greene's words, but most agree that greene was accusing shakespeare of reaching above his rank in trying to match such university-educated writers as christopher marlowe, thomas nashe, and greene himself (the so-called \"university wits\").", "the italicised phrase parodying the line \"oh, tiger's heart wrapped in a woman's hide\" from shakespeare's henry vi, part 3, along with the pun \"shake-scene\", clearly identify shakespeare as greene's target.", "as used here, johannes factotum (\"jack of all trades\") refers to a second-rate tinkerer with the work of others, rather than the more common \"universal genius\".", "greene's attack is the earliest surviving mention of shakespeare's work in the theatre.", "biographers suggest that his career may have begun any time from the mid-1580s to just before greene's remarks.", "after 1594, shakespeare's plays were performed only by the lord chamberlain's men, a company owned by a group of players, including shakespeare, that soon became the leading playing company in london.", "after the death of queen elizabeth in 1603, the company was awarded a royal patent by the new king

named the globe.", "in 1608, the partnership also took over the blackfriars indoor theatre.", "extant records of shakespeare's property purchases and investments indicate that his association with the company made him a wealthy man, and in 1597, he bought the second-largest house in stratford, new place, and in 1605, invested in a share of the parish tithes in stratford.", "some of shakespeare's plays were published in quarto editions, beginning in 1594, and by 1598, his name had become a selling point and began to appear on the title pages.", "shakespeare continued to act in his own and other plays after his success as a playwright.", "the 1616 edition of ben jonson's works names him on the cast lists for every man in his humour (1598) and sejanus his fall (1603).", "the absence of his name from the 1605 cast list for jonson's volpone is taken by some scholars as a sign that his acting career was nearing its end.", "the first folio of 1623, however, lists shakespeare as one of \"the principal actors in all these plays\", some of which were first staged after volpone, although we cannot know for certain which roles he played.", "in 1610, john davies of hereford wrote that \"good will\" played \"kingly\" roles.", "in 1709, rowe passed down a tradition that shakespeare played the ghost of hamlet's father.", "later traditions maintain that he also played adam in as you like it, and the chorus in henry v, though scholars doubt the sources of that information.", "throughout his career, shakespeare divided his time between london and stratford.", "in 1596, the year before he bought new place as his family home in stratford, shakespeare was living in the parish of st. helen's, bishopsgate, north of the river thames.", "he moved across the river to southwark by 1599, the same year his company constructed the globe theatre there.", "by 1604, he had moved north of the river again, to an area north of st paul's cathedral with many fine houses.", "there, he rented rooms from a french huguenot named christopher mountjoy, a maker of ladies' wigs and other headgear.", "rowe was the first biographer to record the tradition, repeated by johnson, that shakespeare retired to stratford \"some years before his death\".", "he was still working as an actor in london in 1608; in an answer to the sharers' petition in 1635, cuthbert burbage stated that after purchasing the lease of the blackfriars theatre in 1608 from henry evans, the king's men \"placed men players\" there, \"which were heminges, condell, shakespeare, etc.\".", "however, it is perhaps relevant that the bubonic plague raged in london throughout 1609. the london public playhouses were repeatedly closed during extended outbreaks of the plague (a total of over 60 months closure between may 1603 and february 1610), which meant there was often no acting work.", "retirement from all work was uncommon at that time.", "shakespeare continued to visit london during the years 1611\u20131614.", "in 1612, he was called as a witness in bellott v. mountjoy, a court case concerning the marriage settlement of mountjoy's daughter, mary.", "in march 1613, he bought a gatehouse in the former blackfriars priory; and from november 1614, he was in london for several weeks with his son-in-law, john hall.", "after 1610, shakespeare wrote fewer plays, and none are attributed to him after 1613. his last three plays were collaborations, probably with john fletcher, who succeeded him as the house playwright of the king's men.", "shakespeare died on 23 april 1616, at the age of 52.", "[f] he died within a month of signing his will, a document which he begins by describing himself as being in \"perfect health\".", "no extant contemporary source explains how or why he died.",

fever there contracted\", not an impossible scenario since shakespeare knew jonson and drayton.", "of the tributes from fellow authors, one refers to his relatively sudden death: \"we wondered,

1607, and judith had married thomas quiney, a vintner, two months before shakespeare's death.", "shakespeare signed his last will and testament on 25 march 1616; the following day, his new son-in-law, thomas quiney was found guilty of fathering an illegitimate son by margaret wheeler, who had died during childbirth.", "thomas was ordered by the church court to do public penance, which would have caused much shame and embarrassment for the shakespeare family.", "shakespeare bequeathed the bulk of his large estate to his elder daughter susanna under stipulations that she pass it down intact to \"the first son of her body\".", "the quineys had three children, all of whom died without marrying.", "the halls had one child, elizabeth, who married twice but died without children in 1670, ending shakespeare's direct line.", "shakespeare's will scarcely mentions his wife, anne, who was probably entitled to one-third of his estate automatically.", "[h] he did make a point, however, of leaving her \"my second best bed\", a bequest that has led to much speculation.", "some scholars see the bequest as an insult to anne, whereas others believe that the second-best bed would have been the matrimonial bed and therefore rich in significance.", "shakespeare was buried in the chancel of the holy trinity church two days after his death.", "the epitaph carved into the stone slab covering his

of writing.", "its plaque compares him to nestor, socrates, and virgil.", "in 1623, in conjunction with the publication of the first folio, the droeshout engraving was published.", "shakespeare has been commemorated in many statues and memorials around the world, including funeral monuments in southwark cathedral and poets' corner in westminster abbey.", "most playwrights of the period typically collaborated with others at some point, and critics agree that shakespeare did the same, mostly early and late in his career.", "the first recorded works of shakespeare are richard iii and the three parts of henry vi, written in the early 1590s during a vogue for historical drama.", "shakespeare's plays are difficult to date precisely, however, and studies of the texts suggest that titus andronicus, the comedy of errors, the taming of the shrew, and the two gentlemen of verona may also belong to shakespeare's earliest period.", "his first histories, which draw heavily on the 1587 edition of raphael holinshed's chronicles of england, scotland, and ireland, dramatise the destructive results of weak or corrupt rule and have been interpreted as a justification for the origins of the tudor dynasty.", "the early plays were influenced by the works of other elizabethan dramatists, especially thomas kyd and christopher marlowe, by the traditions of medieval drama, and by the plays of seneca.", "the comedy of errors was also based on classical models, but no source for the taming of the shrew has been found, though it is related to a separate play of the same name and may have derived from a folk story.", "like the two gentlemen of verona, in which two friends appear to approve of rape, the shrew's story of the taming of a woman's independent spirit by a man sometimes troubles modern critics, directors, and audiences.", "shakespeare's early classical and italianate comedies, containing tight double plots and precise comic sequences, give way in the mid-1590s to the romantic atmosphere of his most acclaimed comedies.", "a midsummer night's dream is a witty mixture of romance, fairy magic, and comic lowlife scenes.", "shakespeare's next comedy, the equally romantic merchant of venice, contains a portrayal of the vengeful jewish moneylender shylock, which reflects elizabethan views but may appear derogatory to modern audiences.", "the wit and wordplay of much ado about nothing, the charming rural setting of as you like it, and the lively merrymaking of twelfth night complete shakespeare's sequence of great comedies.", "after the lyrical richard ii, written almost entirely in verse, shakespeare introduced prose comedy into the histories of the late 1590s, henry iv, parts 1 and 2, and henry v. his characters become more complex and tender as he switches deftly between comic and serious scenes, prose and poetry, and achieves the narrative variety of his mature work.", "this period begins and ends with two tragedies: romeo and juliet, the famous romantic tragedy of sexually charged adolescence, love, and death; and julius caesar\u2014based on sir thomas north's 1579 translation of plutarch's parallel lives\u2014which introduced a new kind of drama.", "according to shakespearean scholar james shapiro, in julius caesar, \"the various strands of politics, character, inwardness, contemporary events, even shakespeare's own reflections on the act of writing, began to infuse each other\".", "in the early 17th century, shakespeare wrote the so-called \"problem plays\" measure for measure, troilus and cressida, and all's well that ends well and a number of his best known tragedies.", "many critics believe that shakespeare's greatest tragedies represent the peak of his art.", "the titular hero of one of shakespeare's greatest tragedies, hamlet, has probably been discussed more than any other shakespearean character, especially for his famous soliloquy which begins \"to be or not to be; that is the question\".", "unlike the introverted hamlet, whose fatal flaw is hesitation, the heroes of the tragedies that followed, othello and king lear, are undone by hasty errors of judgement.", "the plots of shakespeare's tragedies often hinge on such fatal errors or flaws, which overturn order and destroy the hero and those he loves.", "in othello, the villain iago stokes othello's sexual jealousy to the point where he murders the innocent wife who loves him.", "in king lear, the old king commits the tragic error of giving up his powers, initiating the events which lead to the torture and blinding of the earl of gloucester and the murder of lear's youngest daughter cordelia.", "according to the critic frank kermode, \"the play-offers neither its good characters nor its audience any relief from its cruelty\".", "in macbeth, the shortest and most compressed of shakespeare's tragedies, uncontrollable ambition incites macbeth and his wife, lady macbeth, to murder the rightful king and usurp the throne until their own guilt destroys them in turn.", "in this play, shakespeare adds a supernatural element to the tragic structure.", "his last major tragedies, antony and cleopatra and coriolanus, contain some of shakespeare's finest poetry and were considered his most successful tragedies by the poet and critic t.s.", "eliot.", "in his final period, shakespeare turned to romance or tragicomedy and completed three more major plays: cymbeline, the winter's tale, and the tempest, as well as the collaboration, pericles, prince of tyre.", "less bleak than the tragedies, these four plays are graver in tone than the comedies of the 1590s, but they end with reconciliation and the forgiveness of potentially tragic errors.", "some commentators have seen this change in mood as evidence of a more serene view of life on shakespeare's part, but it may merely reflect the theatrical fashion of the day.", "shakespeare collaborated on two further surviving plays, henry viii and the two noble kinsmen, probably with john fletcher.", "it is not clear for which companies shakespeare wrote his early plays.", "the title page of the 1594 edition of titus andronicus reveals that the play had been acted by three different troupes.", "after the plagues of 1592\u201393, shakespeare's plays were performed by his own company at the theatre and the curtain in shoreditch, north of the thames.", "londoners flocked

othello, and king lear.", "after the lord chamberlain's men were renamed the king's men in 1603, they entered a special relationship with the new king james.", "although the performance records are patchy, the king's men performed seven of shakespeare's plays at court between 1 november 1604, and 31 october 1605, including two performances of the merchant of venice.", "after 1608, they performed at the indoor blackfriars theatre during the winter and the globe during the summer.", "the indoor setting, combined with the jacobean fashion for lavishly staged masques, allowed shakespeare to introduce more elaborate stage devices.", "in cymbeline, for example, jupiter descends \"in thunder and lightning, sitting upon an eagle: he throws a thunderbolt.", "the ghosts fall on their knees.\"", "the actors in shakespeare's company included the famous richard burbage, william kempe, henry condell and john heminges.", "burbage played the leading role in the first performances of many of shakespeare's plays, including richard iii, hamlet, othello, and king lear.", "the popular comic actor will kempe played the servant peter in romeo and juliet and dogberry in much ado about

that henry viii \"was set forth with many extraordinary circumstances of pomp and ceremony\".", "on 29 june, however, a cannon set fire to the thatch of the globe and burned the theatre to the ground, an event which pinpoints the date of a shakespeare play with rare precision.", "in 1623, john heminges and henry condell, two of shakespeare's friends from the king's men, published the first folio, a collected edition of shakespeare's plays.", "it contained 36 texts, including 18 printed for the first time.", "many of the plays had already appeared in quarto versions\u2014flimsy books made from sheets of paper folded twice to make four leaves.", "no evidence suggests that shakespeare approved these editions, which the first folio describes as \"stol'n and surreptitious copies\".", "nor did shakespeare plan or expect his works to survive in any form at all; those works likely would have faded into oblivion but for his friends' spontaneous idea, after his death, to create and publish the first folio.", "alfred pollard termed some of the pre-1623 versions as \"bad quartos\" because of their adapted, paraphrased or garbled texts, which may in places have been reconstructed from memory.", "where several versions of a play survive, each differs from the other.", "the differences may stem from copying or printing errors, from notes by actors or audience members, or from shakespeare's own papers.", "in some cases, for example, hamlet, troilus and cressida, and othello, shakespeare could have revised the texts between the quarto and folio editions.", "in the case of king lear, however, while most modern editions do conflate them, the 1623 folio version is so different from the 1608 quarto that the oxford shakespeare prints them both, arguing that they cannot be conflated without confusion.", "in 1593 and 1594, when the theatres were closed because of plague, shakespeare published two narrative poems on sexual themes, venus and adonis and the rape of lucrece.", "he dedicated them to henry wriothesley, earl of southampton.", "in venus and adonis, an innocent adonis rejects the sexual advances of venus; while in the rape of lucrece, the virtuous wife lucrece is raped by the lustful tarquin.", "influenced by ovid's metamorphoses, the poems show the guilt and moral confusion that result from uncontrolled lust.", "both proved popular and were often reprinted during shakespeare's lifetime.", "a third narrative poem, a lover's complaint, in which a young woman laments her seduction by a persuasive suitor, was printed in the first edition of

not certain when each of the 154 sonnets was composed, but evidence suggests that shakespeare wrote sonnets throughout his career for a private readership.", "even before the two unauthorised sonnets

and argue that it was an extension of the middle ages.", "the intellectual basis of the renaissance was its version of humanism, derived from the concept of roman humanitas and the rediscovery of classical greek philosophy, such as that of protagoras, who said that \"man is the measure of all things.\"", "this new thinking became manifest in art, architecture, politics, science and

century, in particular with the writings of dante and the paintings of giotto.", "as a cultural movement, the renaissance encompassed innovative flowering of latin and vernacular literatures, beginning with the 14th-century resurgence of learning based on classical sources, which contemporaries credited to petrarch; the development of linear perspective and other techniques of rendering a more natural reality in painting; and gradual but widespread educational reform.", "in politics, the renaissance contributed to the development of the customs and conventions of diplomacy, and in science to an increased reliance on observation and inductive reasoning.", "although the renaissance saw revolutions in many intellectual pursuits, as well as social and political upheaval, it is perhaps best known for its artistic developments and the contributions of such polymaths as leonardo da vinci and michelangelo, who inspired the term \"renaissance man\".", "the renaissance began in the 14th century in florence, italy.", "various theories have been proposed to account for its origins and characteristics, focusing on a variety of factors including the social and civic

humanists such as poggio bracciolini sought out in europe's monastic libraries the latin literary, historical, and oratorical texts of antiquity, while the fall of constantinople (1453) generated a wave of \u00e9migr\u00e9 greek scholars bringing precious manuscripts in ancient greek, many of which had fallen into obscurity in the west.", "it is in their new focus on literary and historical texts that renaissance scholars differed so markedly from the medieval scholars of the renaissance of the 12th century, who had focused on studying greek and arabic works of natural sciences, philosophy and mathematics, rather than on such cultural texts.", "in the revival of neo-platonism renaissance humanists did not reject christianity; quite the contrary, many of the greatest works of the renaissance were devoted to it, and the church patronized many works of renaissance art.", "however, a subtle shift took place in the way that intellectuals approached religion that was reflected in many other areas of cultural life.", "in addition, many greek christian works, including the greek new testament, were brought back from byzantium to western europe and engaged western scholars for the first time since late antiquity.", "this new engagement with greek christian works, and particularly the return to the original greek of the new testament promoted by humanists lorenzo valla and

revival of ideas from antiquity, and through novel approaches to thought.", "some scholars, such as rodney stark, play down the renaissance in favour of the earlier innovations of the italian city-states in the high middle ages, which married responsive government, christianity and the birth of capitalism.", "this analysis argues that, whereas the great european states (france and spain) were absolutist monarchies, and others were under direct church control, the independent city republics of italy took over the principles of capitalism invented on monastic estates and set off a vast unprecedented commercial revolution that preceded and financed the renaissance.", "many argue that the ideas characterizing the renaissance had their origin in late 13th-century florence, in particular with the writings of dante alighieri (1265\u20131321) and petrarch (1304\u20131374), as well as the paintings of giotto di bondone (1267\u20131337).", "some writers date the renaissance quite precisely; one proposed starting point is 1401, when the rival geniuses lorenzo ghiberti and filippo brunelleschi competed for the contract to build the bronze doors for the baptistery of the florence cathedral (ghiberti won).", "others see more general competition between artists and polymaths such as brunelleschi, ghiberti, donatello, and masaccio for artistic commissions as sparking the creativity of the renaissance.", "yet it remains much debated why the renaissance began in italy, and why it began when it did.", "accordingly, several theories have been put forward to explain its origins.", "during the renaissance, money and art went hand in hand.", "artists depended entirely on patrons while the patrons needed money to foster artistic talent.", "wealth was brought to italy in

natural science, philosophy and mathematics.", "renaissance scholars were most interested in recovering and studying latin and greek literary, historical, and oratorical texts.", "broadly speaking, this began in the 14th century with a latin phase, when renaissance scholars such as petrarch, coluccio salutati (1331\u20131406), niccol\u00f2 de' niccoli (1364\u20131437) and poggio bracciolini (1380\u20131459) scoured the libraries of europe in search of works by such latin authors as cicero, lucretius, livy and seneca.", "by the early 15th century, the bulk of the surviving such latin literature had been recovered; the greek phase of renaissance humanism was under way, as western european scholars turned to recovering ancient greek literary, historical, oratorical and theological texts.", "unlike with latin texts, which had been preserved and studied in western europe since late antiquity, the study of ancient greek texts was very limited in medieval western europe.", "ancient greek works on science, maths and philosophy had been studied since the high middle ages in western europe and in the medieval islamic world (normally in translation), but greek literary, oratorical and historical works (such as homer, the greek dramatists, demosthenes and thucydides) were not studied in either the latin or medieval islamic worlds; in the middle ages these sorts of texts were only studied by byzantine scholars.", "one of the greatest achievements of renaissance scholars was to bring this entire class of greek cultural works back into western europe for the first time since late antiquity.", "arab logicians had inherited greek ideas after they had invaded and conquered egypt and the levant.", "their translations and commentaries on these ideas worked their way through the arab west into iberia and sicily, which became important centers for this transmission of ideas.", "from the 11th to the 13th century, many schools dedicated to the translation of philosophical and scientific works from classical arabic to medieval latin were established in iberia.", "most notably the toledo school of translators.", "this work of translation from islamic culture, though largely unplanned and disorganized, constituted one of the greatest transmissions of ideas in history.", "the movement to reintegrate the regular study of greek literary, historical, oratorical and theological texts back into the western european curriculum is usually dated to the 1396 invitation from coluccio salutati to the byzantine diplomat and scholar manuel chrysoloras (c. 1355\u20131415) to teach greek in florence.", "this legacy was continued by a number of expatriate greek scholars, from basilios bessarion to leo allatius.", "the unique political structures of late middle ages italy have led some to theorize that its unusual social climate allowed the emergence of a rare cultural efflorescence.", "italy did not exist as a political entity in the early modern period.", "instead, it was divided into smaller city states and territories: the kingdom of naples controlled the south, the republic of florence and the papal states at the center, the milanese and the genoese to the north and west respectively, and the venetians to the east.", "fifteenth-century italy was one of the most urbanised areas in europe.", "many of its cities stood among the ruins of ancient roman buildings; it seems likely that the classical nature of the renaissance was linked to its origin in the roman empire's heartland.", "historian and political philosopher quentin skinner points out that otto of freising (c. 1114\u20131158), a german bishop visiting north italy during the 12th century, noticed a widespread new form of political and social organization, observing that italy appeared to have exited from feudalism so that its society was based on merchants and commerce.", "linked to this was anti-monarchical thinking, represented in the famous early renaissance fresco cycle the allegory of good and bad government by ambrogio lorenzetti (painted 1338\u20131340), whose strong message is about the virtues of fairness, justice, republicanism and good administration.", "holding both church and empire at bay, these city republics were devoted to notions of liberty.", "skinner reports that there were many defences of liberty such as the matteo palmieri (1406\u20131475) celebration of florentine genius not only in art, sculpture and architecture, but \"the remarkable efflorescence of moral, social and political philosophy that occurred in florence at the same time\".", "even cities and states beyond central italy, such as the republic of florence at this time, were also notable for their merchant republics, especially the republic of venice.", "although in practice these were oligarchical, and bore little resemblance to a modern democracy, they did have democratic features and were responsive states, with forms of participation in governance and belief in liberty.", "the relative political freedom they afforded was conducive to academic and artistic advancement.", "likewise, the position of italian cities such as venice as great trading centres made them intellectual crossroads.", "merchants brought with them ideas from far corners of the globe, particularly the levant.", "venice was europe's gateway to trade with the east, and a producer of fine glass, while florence was a capital of textiles.", "the wealth such business brought to italy meant large public and private artistic projects could be commissioned and individuals had more leisure time for study.", "one theory that has been advanced is that the devastation in florence caused by the black death, which hit europe between 1348 and 1350, resulted in a shift in the world view of people in 14th-century italy.", "italy was particularly badly hit by the plague, and it has been speculated that the resulting familiarity with death caused thinkers to dwell more on their lives on earth, rather than on spirituality and the afterlife.", "it has also been argued that the black death prompted a new wave of piety, manifested in the sponsorship of religious works of art.", "however, this does not fully explain why the renaissance occurred specifically in italy in the 14th century.", "the black death was a pandemic that affected all of europe in the ways described, not only italy.", "the renaissance's emergence in italy was most likely the result of the complex interaction of the above factors.", "the plague was carried by fleas on sailing vessels returning from the ports of asia, spreading quickly due to lack of proper sanitation: the population of england, then about 4.2 million, lost 1.4 million people to the bubonic plague.", "florence's population was nearly halved in the year 1347. as a result of the decimation in the populace the value of the working class increased, and commoners came to enjoy more freedom.", "to answer the increased need for labor, workers traveled in search of the most favorable position economically.", "the demographic decline due to the plague had economic consequences: the prices of food dropped and land values declined by 30\u201340% in most parts of europe between 1350 and 1400. landholders faced a great loss, but for ordinary men and women it was a windfall.", "the survivors of the plague found not only that the prices of food were cheaper but also that lands were more abundant, and many of them inherited property from their dead relatives.", "the spread of disease was significantly more rampant in areas of poverty.", "epidemics ravaged cities, particularly children.", "plagues were easily spread by lice, unsanitary drinking water, armies, or by poor sanitation.", "children were hit the hardest because many diseases, such as typhus and syphilis, target the immune system, leaving young children without a fighting chance.", "children in city dwellings were more affected by the spread of disease than the children of the wealthy.", "the black death caused greater upheaval to florence's social and political structure than later epidemics.", "despite a significant number of deaths among members of the ruling classes, the government of florence continued to function during this period.", "formal meetings of elected representatives were suspended during the height of the epidemic due to the chaotic conditions in the city, but a small group of officials was appointed to conduct the affairs of the city, which ensured continuity of government.", "it has long been a matter of debate why the renaissance began in florence, and not elsewhere in italy.", "scholars have noted several features unique to florentine cultural life that may have caused such a cultural movement.", "many have emphasized the role played by the medici, a banking family and later ducal ruling house, in patronizing and stimulating the arts.", "lorenzo de' medici (1449\u20131492) was the catalyst for an enormous amount of arts patronage, encouraging his countrymen to commission works from the leading artists of florence, including leonardo da vinci, sandro botticelli, and michelangelo buonarroti.", "works by neri di bicci, botticelli, da vinci and filippino lippi had been commissioned additionally by the convent of san donato in scopeto in florence.", "the renaissance was certainly underway before lorenzo de' medici came to power \u2013 indeed, before the medici family itself achieved hegemony in florentine society.", "some historians have postulated that florence was the birthplace of the renaissance as a result of luck, i.e., because \"great men\" were born there by chance: leonardo da vinci, botticelli and michelangelo were all born in tuscany.", "arguing that such chance seems improbable, other historians have contended that these \"great men\" were only able to rise to prominence because of the prevailing cultural conditions at the time.", "in some ways, renaissance humanism was not a philosophy but a method of learning.", "in contrast to the medieval scholastic mode, which focused on resolving contradictions between authors, renaissance humanists would study ancient texts in the original and appraise them through a combination of reasoning and empirical evidence.", "humanist education was based on the programme of 'studia humanitatis', the study of five humanities: poetry, grammar, history, moral philosophy and rhetoric.", "although historians have sometimes struggled to define humanism precisely, most have settled on \"a middle of the road

cicero, who, like palmieri, lived an active public life as a citizen and official, as well as a theorist and philosopher and also quintilian.", "perhaps the most succinct expression of his perspective on humanism is in a 1465 poetic work la citt\u00e0 di vita, but an earlier work, della vita civile, is more wide-ranging.", "composed as a series of dialogues set in a country house in the mugello countryside outside florence during the plague of 1430, palmieri expounds on the qualities of the ideal citizen.", "the dialogues include ideas about how children develop mentally and physically, how citizens can conduct themselves morally, how citizens and states can ensure probity in public life, and an important debate on the difference between that which is pragmatically useful and that which is honest.", "the humanists believed that it is important to transcend to the afterlife with a perfect mind and body, which could be attained with education.", "the purpose of humanism was to create a

place, a battle in which both sides claimed victory and celebrated the victory: the troops of king alfonso v were beaten by the castilian centre-left commanded by the duke of alba and cardinal mendoza while the forces led by john of portugal defeated the castilian right wing and remained in possession of the battlefield.", "but despite its uncertain outcome, the battle of toro represented a great political victory for the catholic monarchs, assuring them the throne since the supporters of joanna la beltraneja disbanded and the portuguese army, without allies, left castile.as summarised by the historian justo l. gonz\u00e1lez:", "both armies faced each other at the camps of toro resulting in an indecisive battle.", "but while the portuguese king reorganised his troops, ferdinand sent news to all the cities of castile and to several foreign kingdoms informing them about a huge victory where the portuguese were crushed.", "faced with these news, the party of \"la beltraneja\" [joanna] was dissolved and the portuguese were forced to return to their kingdom.", "with great political vision, isabella took advantage of the moment and convoked courts at madrigal-segovia (april\u2013october 1476) where her eldest child and daughter isabella was first sworn as heiress to castile's crown.", "that was equivalent to legitimising isabella's own throne.", "in august of the same year, isabella proved her abilities as a powerful ruler on her own.", "a rebellion broke out in segovia, and isabella rode out to suppress it, as her husband ferdinand was off fighting at the time.", "going against the advice of her male advisors, isabella rode by herself into the city to negotiate with the rebels.", "she was successful and the rebellion was quickly brought to an end.", "two years later, isabella further secured her place as ruler with the birth of her son john, prince of asturias, on 30 june 1478. to many, the presence of a male heir legitimised her place as ruler.", "meanwhile, the castilian and portuguese fleets fought for hegemony in the atlantic ocean and for the wealth of guinea (gold and slaves), where the decisive naval battle of guinea was fought.", "the war dragged on for another three years and ended with a castilian victory on land and a portuguese victory on the sea.", "the four separate peace treaties signed at alc\u00e1\u00e7ovas (4 september 1479) reflected that result: portugal gave up the throne of castile in favour of isabella in exchange for a very favourable share of the atlantic territories disputed with castile (they all went to portugal with the exception of the canary islands: guinea with its mines of gold, cape verde, madeira, azores, and the right of conquest over the kingdom of fez) plus a large war compensation: 106.676 dobles of gold.", "the catholic monarchs also had to accept that joanna la beltraneja remain in portugal instead of spain and to pardon all rebellious subjects who had supported joanna and king alfonso.", "and the catholic monarchs\u2014who had proclaimed themselves rulers of portugal and donated lands to noblemen inside this country\u2014had to give up the portuguese crown.", "at alc\u00e1\u00e7ovas, isabella and ferdinand had conquered the throne, but the portuguese exclusive right of navigation and commerce in all of the atlantic ocean south of the canary islands meant that spain was practically blocked out of the atlantic and was deprived of the gold of guinea, which induced anger in andalusia.", "spanish academic antonio rumeu de armas claims that with the peace treaty of alc\u00e1\u00e7ovas in 1479, the catholic monarchs \"...buy the peace at an excessively expensive price...\" and historian m\u00aa monserrat le\u00f3n guerrero added that they \"...find themselves forced to abandon their expansion by the atlantic...\".", "christopher columbus freed castile from this difficult situation, because his new world discovery led to a new and much more balanced sharing of the atlantic at tordesillas in 1494. as the orders received by columbus in his first voyage (1492) show: \"[the catholic monarchs] have always in mind that the limits signed in the share of alc\u00e1\u00e7ovas should not be overcome, and thus they insist with columbus to sail along the parallel of canary.\"", "thus, by sponsoring the columbian adventure to the west, the spanish monarchs were trying the only remaining path of expansion.", "as is now known, they would be extremely successful on this issue.", "isabella had proven herself to be a fighter and tough monarch from the start.", "now that she had succeeded in securing her place on the castilian throne, she could begin to institute the reforms that the kingdom desperately needed.", "when isabella came to the throne in 1474, castile was in a state of despair due to her brother henry's reign.", "it was not unknown that henry iv was a big spender and did little to enforce the laws of his kingdom.", "it was even said by one castilian denizen of the time that murder, rape, and robbery happened without punishment.", "because of this, isabella needed desperately to find a way to reform her kingdom.", "due to the measures imposed, historians during her lifetime saw her to be more inclined to justice than to mercy, and indeed far more rigorous and unforgiving than her husband ferdinand.", "isabella's first major reform came during the cortes of madrigal in 1476 in the form of a police force, la santa hermandad (the holy brotherhood).", "while 1476 was not the first time that castile had seen the hermandad, it was the first time that the police force was used by the crown.", "during the late medieval period, the expression hermandad had been used to describe groups of men who came together of their own accord to regulate law and order by patrolling the roads and countryside and punishing malefactors.", "these brotherhoods had usually been suppressed by the monarch, however.before 1476, the justice system in most parts of the country was effectively under the control of dissident members of the nobility rather than royal officials.", "to fix this problem, during 1476, a general hermandad was established for castile, leon, and asturias.", "the police force was to be made up of locals who were to regulate the crime occurring in the kingdom.", "it was to be paid for by a tax of 1800 maraved\u00eds on every one hundred households.", "in 1477, isabella visited extremadura and andalusia to introduce this more efficient police force there as well.", "keeping with her reformation of the regulation of laws, in 1481 isabella charged two officials with restoring peace in galicia.", "this turbulent province had been the prey of tyrant nobles since the days of isabella's father, john ii.", "robbers infested the highways and oppressed the smaller towns and villages.", "these officials set off with the herculean task of restoring peace for the province.", "the officials were successful.", "they succeeded in driving over 1,500 robbers from galicia.", "from the very beginning of her reign, isabella fully grasped the importance of restoring the crown's finances.", "the reign of henry iv had left the kingdom of castile in great debt.", "upon examination, it was found that the chief cause of the nation's poverty was the wholesale alienation of royal estates during henry's reign.", "to make money, henry had sold off royal estates at prices well below their value.", "the cortes of toledo of 1480 came to the conclusion that the only hope of lasting financial reform lay in a resumption of these alienated lands and rents.", "this decision was warmly approved by many leading nobles of the court, but isabella was reluctant to take such drastic measures.", "it was decided that the cardinal of spain would hold an enquiry into the tenure of estates and rents acquired during henry iv's reign.", "those that had not been granted as a reward for services were to be restored without compensation, while those that had been sold at a price far below their real value were to be bought back at the same sum.", "while many of the nobility were forced to pay large sums of money for their estates, the royal treasury became even richer.", "isabella's one stipulation was that there would be no revocation of gifts made to churches, hospitals, or the poor.", "another issue of money was the overproduction of coinage and the abundance of mints in the kingdom.", "during henry's reign, the number of mints regularly producing money had increased from just five to 150. much of the coinage produced in these mints was nearly worthless.", "during the first year of her reign, isabella established a monopoly over the royal mints and fixed a legal standard to which the coinage had to approximate[citation needed].", "by shutting down many of the mints and taking royal control over the production of money, isabella restored the confidence of the public in the crown's ability to handle the kingdom's finances.", "both isabella and ferdinand established very few new governmental and administrative institutions in their respective kingdoms.", "especially in castile, the main achievement was to use more effectively the institutions that had existed during the reigns of john ii and henry iv.", "historically, the center of the castilian government had been the royal household, together with its surrounding court.", "the household was traditionally divided into two overlapping bodies.", "the first body was made up of household officials, mainly people of the nobility, who carried out governmental and political functions for which they received special payment.", "the second body was made up of some 200 permanent servants or continos who performed a wide range of confidential functions on behalf of the rulers.", "by the 1470s, when isabella began to take a firm grip on the royal administration, the senior offices of the royal household were simply honorary titles and held strictly by the nobility.", "the positions of a more secretarial nature were often held by senior churchmen.", "substantial revenues were attached to such offices and were therefore enjoyed greatly, on an effectively hereditary basis, by the great castilian houses of nobility.", "while the nobles held the titles, individuals of lesser breeding did the real work.", "traditionally, the main advisory body to the rulers of castile was the royal council.", "the council, under the monarch, had full power to resolve all legal and political disputes.", "the council was responsible for supervising all senior administrative officials, such as the crown representatives in all of the major towns.", "it was also the supreme judicial tribunal of the kingdom.", "in 1480, during the cortes of toledo, isabella made many reforms to the royal council.", "previously there had been two distinct yet overlapping categories of royal councillor.", "one formed a group which possessed both judicial and administrative responsibilities.", "this portion consisted of some bishops, some nobles, and an increasingly important element of professional administrators with legal training known as letrados.", "the second category of traditional councillor had a less formal role.", "this role depended greatly on the individuals' political influence and personal influence with the monarch.", "during isabella's reign, the role of this second category was completely eliminated.", "as mentioned previously, isabella had little care for personal bribes or favours.", "because of this, this second type of councillor, usually of the nobility, was only allowed to attend the council of castile as an observer.", "isabella began to rely more on the professional administrators than ever before.", "these men were mostly of the bourgeoisie or lesser nobility.", "the council was also rearranged and it was officially settled that one bishop, three caballeros, and eight or nine lawyers would serve on the council at a time.", "while the nobles were no longer directly involved in the matters of state, they were welcome to attend the meetings.", "isabella hoped by forcing the nobility to choose whether to participate or not would weed out those who were not dedicated to the state and its cause.", "isabella also saw the need to provide a personal relationship between herself as the monarch and her subjects.", "therefore, isabella and ferdinand set aside a time every friday during which they themselves would sit and allow people to come to them with complaints.", "this was a new form of personal justice that castile had not seen before.", "the council of state was reformed and presided over by the king and queen.", "this department of public affairs dealt mainly with foreign negotiations, hearing embassies, and transacting business with the court of rome.", "in addition to these departments, there was also a supreme court of the santa hermandad, a council of finance, and a council for settling purely aragonese matters.", "although isabella made many reforms that seem to have made the cortes stronger, in actuality the cortes lost political power during the reigns of isabella and ferdinand.", "isabella and her husband moved in the direction of a non-parliamentary government and the cortes became an almost passive advisory body, giving automatic assent to legislation which had been drafted by the royal administration.", "after the reforms of the cortes of toledo, the queen ordered a noted jurist, alfonso diaz de montalvo, to undertake the task of clearing away legal rubbish and compiling what remained into a comprehensive code.", "within four years the work stood completed in eight bulky volumes and the ordenanzas reales took their place on legal bookshelves.", "at the end of the reconquista, only granada was left for isabella and ferdinand to conquer.", "the emirate of granada had been held by the muslim nasrid dynasty since the mid-13th century.", "protected by natural barriers and fortified towns, it had withstood the long process of the reconquista.", "on 1 february 1482, the king and queen reached medina del campo and this is generally considered the beginning of the war for granada.", "while isabella's and ferdinand's involvement in the war was apparent from the start, granada's leadership was divided and never able to present a united front.", "it still took ten years to conquer granada, however, culminating in 1492.", "the spanish monarchs recruited soldiers from many european countries and improved their artillery with the latest and best cannons.", "systematically, they proceeded to take the kingdom piece by piece.", "in 1485 they laid siege to ronda, which surrendered after only a fortnight due to extensive bombardment.", "the following year, loja was taken, and again muhammad xii was captured and released.", "one year later, with the fall of m\u00e1laga, the western part of the muslim nasrid kingdom had fallen into spanish hands.", "the eastern province succumbed after the fall of baza in 1489. the siege of granada began in the spring of 1491 and at the end of the year, muhammad xii surrendered.", "on 2 january 1492 isabella and ferdinand entered granada to receive the keys of the city, and the principal mosque was reconsecrated as a church.", "the treaty of granada was signed later that year, and in it ferdinand and isabella gave their word to allow the muslims and jews of granada to live in peace.", "during the war, isabella noted the abilities and energy of gonzalo fern\u00e1ndez de c\u00f3rdoba and made him one of the two commissioners for the negotiations.", "under her patronage, de c\u00f3rdoba went on to an extraordinary military career that revolutionised the organisation and tactics of the emerging spanish military, changing the nature of warfare and altering the european balance of power.", "just three months after entering granada, queen isabella agreed to sponsor christopher columbus on an expedition to reach the indies by sailing west (2000 miles, according to columbus).", "the crown agreed to pay a sum of money as a concession from monarch to subject.", "his expedition departed on 3 august 1492, and arrived in san salvador island on 12 october.", "he named it san salvador after jesus the savior.", "he returned the next year and presented his findings to the monarchs, bringing natives and gold under a hero's welcome.", "although columbus was sponsored by the castilian queen,

1494, by the treaty of tordesillas, isabella and ferdinand agreed to divide the earth, outside of europe, with king john ii of portugal.", "the portuguese did not recognise that south america belonged to the spanish because it was in portugal's sphere of influence, and the portuguese king john ii threatened to send an army to claim the land for the portuguese.", "isabella was not in favour of columbus' enslavement of the american natives and attempted to enforce the recent policies of the canaries upon the 'new world', stating that all peoples were under the subject of the castilian crown and could not be enslaved in most situations.", "the principles she established would have very little effect during her lifetime, however.", "with the institution of the roman catholic inquisition in spain, and with the dominican friar tom\u00e1s de torquemada as the first inquisitor general, the catholic monarchs pursued a policy of religious and national unity.", "though isabella opposed taking harsh measures against jews on economic grounds, torquemada was able to convince ferdinand.", "[citation needed] on 31 march 1492, the alhambra decree for the expulsion of the jews was issued.", "the jews had until the end of july, four months, to leave the country and they were not to take with them gold, silver, money, arms, or horses.", "traditionally, it had been claimed that as many as 200,000 jews left spain, but recent historians have shown that such figures are exaggerated: henry kamen has shown that out of a total population of 80,000 jews, a maximum of 40,000 left and the rest
