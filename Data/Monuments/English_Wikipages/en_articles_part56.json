(none were published at the time) showing a growing range and maturity.", "musicologists have identified a theme similar to those of his third symphony in a set of variations written in 1791. it was perhaps on neefe's recommendation that beethoven received his first commissions; the literary society in bonn commissioned a cantata to mark the occasion of the death in 1790 of joseph ii (woo 87),  and a further cantata, to celebrate the subsequent accession of leopold ii as holy roman emperor (woo 88), may have been commissioned by the elector.. these two emperor cantatas were never performed at the time and they remained lost until the 1880s, when they were described by the composer johannes brahms as \"beethoven through and through\" and as such prophetic of the style which would mark his music as distinct from the classical tradition.", "beethoven was probably first introduced to joseph haydn in late 1790, when the latter was travelling to london and stopped in bonn around

of war spilling out of france; he learned shortly after his arrival that his father had died.", "over the next few years, beethoven responded to the widespread feeling that he was a successor to the recently deceased mozart by studying that master's work and writing works with a distinctly mozartean flavour.", "he did not immediately set out to establish himself as a composer, but rather devoted himself to study and performance.", "working under haydn's direction, he sought to master counterpoint.", "he also studied violin under ignaz schuppanzigh.", "early in this period, he also began receiving occasional instruction from antonio salieri, primarily in italian vocal composition style; this relationship persisted until at least 1802, and possibly as late as 1809.", "with haydn's departure for england in 1794, beethoven was expected by the elector to return home to bonn.", "he chose instead to remain in vienna, continuing his instruction in counterpoint with johann albrechtsberger and other teachers.", "in any case, by this time it must have seemed clear to his employer that bonn would fall to the french, as it did in october 1794, effectively leaving beethoven without a stipend or the necessity to return.", "however, a number of viennese noblemen had already recognised his ability and offered him financial support, among them prince joseph franz lobkowitz, prince karl lichnowsky, and baron gottfried van swieten.", "assisted by his connections with haydn and waldstein, beethoven began to develop a reputation as a performer and improviser in the salons of

reputation in vienna as a piano virtuoso, but he apparently withheld works from publication so that their eventual appearance would have greater impact.", "his first public performance in vienna was in march 1795, where he first performed one of his piano concertos.", "[n 3] shortly after this performance, he arranged for the publication of the first of his compositions to which he assigned an opus number, the three piano trios, opus 1. these works were dedicated to his patron prince lichnowsky, and were a financial success; beethoven's profits were nearly sufficient to cover his living expenses for a year.", "in 1799 beethoven participated in (and won) a notorious piano 'duel' at the home of baron raimund wetzlar (a former patron of mozart) against the virtuoso joseph w\u00f6lfl;

one of the most important of a generation of young composers following haydn and mozart.", "but his melodies, musical development, use of modulation and texture, and characterisation of emotion all set him apart from his influences, and heightened the impact some of his early works made when they were first published.", "for the premiere of his first symphony, he hired the burgtheater on 2 april

mixed, but the concert was a financial success; he was able to charge three times the cost of a typical concert ticket.", "his business dealings with publishers also began to improve in 1802 when his brother kaspar, who had previously assisted him casually, began to assume a larger role in the management of his affairs.", "in addition to negotiating higher prices for recently composed works, kaspar also began selling some of his earlier unpublished compositions, and encouraged him (against beethoven's preference) to also make arrangements and transcriptions of his more popular works for other instrument combinations.", "beethoven acceded to these requests, as he could not prevent publishers from hiring others to do similar arrangements of his works.", "beethoven told the english pianist charles neate (in 1815) that he dated his hearing loss from a fit he suffered in 1798 induced by a quarrel with a singer.. during its gradual decline, his hearing was further impeded by a severe form of tinnitus.", "as early as 1801, he wrote to wegeler and another friend karl amenda, describing his symptoms and the difficulties they caused in both professional and social settings

for and through his art.", "the letter was never actually sent and was discovered in the composer\u2019s papers after his death.", "the letters to wegeler and amenda were not so despairing; in them beethoven commented also on his ongoing professional and financial success at this period, and his determination, as he expressed it to wegeler, to \u201cseize fate by the throat; it shall certainly not crush me completely.\u201d in 1806, beethoven noted on of his musical sketches \"let your deafness no longer be a secret \u2013 even in art.", "\".", "beethoven's hearing loss did not prevent him

withdrawal.)", "czerny remarked however that beethoven could still hear speech and music normally until 1812.", "beethoven\u2019s return to vienna from heiligenstadt was marked by a change in musical style, and is now often designated as the start of his middle or \"heroic\" period characterised by many original works composed on a grand scale.", "according to carl czerny, beethoven said, \"i am not satisfied with the work i have done so far.", "from now on i intend to take a new way.\"", "an early major work employing this new style was the third symphony in e flat op.", "55, known as the eroica, written in 1803-4. the idea of creating a symphony based on the career of napoleon may have been suggested to beethoven by count bernadotte in 1798. beethoven, sympathetic to the ideal of the heroic revolutionary leader, originally gave the symphony the title \"bonaparte\", but disillusioned by napoleon declaring himself emperor in 1804, he scratched napoleon's name from the manuscript's title page, and the symphony was published in 1806 with its present title and the subtitle \"to celebrate the memory of a great man.\"", "the eroica was longer and larger in scope than any previous symphony.", "when it premiered in early 1805 it received a mixed reception.", "some listeners objected to its length or misunderstood its structure, while others viewed it as a masterpiece.", "other middle period works extend in the same dramatic manner the musical language beethoven had inherited.", "the rasumovsky string quartets, and the waldstein and appassionata piano sonatas share the heroic spirit of the third symphony.. other works of this period include the fourth through eighth symphonies,   the oratorio christ on the mount of olives, the opera fidelio, and the violin concerto.", "beethoven was hailed in 1810 by the writer and composer e. t. a. hoffmann, in an influential review in the allgemeine musikalische zeitung, as the  greatest of (what he considered) the three \"romantic\" composers, (that is, ahead of haydn and mozart); in beethoven's fifth symphony his music \"sets in motion terror, fear, horror, pain, and awakens the infinite yearning that is the essence of romanticism\".", "during this time his income came from publishing his works, from performances of them, and from his patrons, for whom he gave private performances and copies of works they commissioned for an exclusive period prior to their publication.", "some of his early patrons, including prince lobkowitz and prince lichnowsky, gave him annual stipends in addition to commissioning works and purchasing published works.", "perhaps his most important aristocratic patron was archduke rudolf of austria , archbishop of olomouc and cardinal-priest, and the youngest son of emperor leopold ii, who in 1803 or 1804 began to study piano and composition with him.", "they became friends, and their meetings continued until 1824. beethoven was to dedicate 14 compositions to rudolph,

time.", "it was delayed again by the austrian censor, and finally premiered, under its present tile of fidelio in november 1805 to houses that were nearly empty because of the french occupation of the

recognition.", "in 1807 the musician and publisher muzio clementi secured the rights for publishing his works in england, and haydn's former patron prince esterh\u00e1zy commissioned a mass (the mass
