architect ernests \u0161t\u0101lbergs, construction began on november 18, 1931. financed by private donations, the monument was erected by the entrance to the old town, in the same place where the previous central monument of riga, a bronze equestrian statue of the russian emperor peter the great had stood from 1910 until the outbreak of world war i. it was calculated in 1935, the year when the monument was unveiled, that in four years of construction 308,000 man-hours were required to work the stone materials alone: 130 years would have been required if one person were to carry out the work using the most advanced equipment of the time.", "the total weight of materials used was about 2,500 tons: such a quantity of materials would have required about 200 freight cars if transported by

still three streets carrying traffic around it.", "high concentrations of nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide have been recorded near the monument, which in combination with water cause corrosion of

worn out by constant vibrations caused by traffic.", "the porous travertine has gradually crumbled over time and its pores have filled with soot and particles of sand, causing it to blacken and providing a habitat for small organisms, such as moss and lichens.", "irregular maintenance and the unskillful performance of restoration work have also contributed to the weathering of the monument.", "to prevent its further decay some of the fastenings were replaced with polyurethane filler and water repellent was applied to the monument during the restoration in 2001. it was also determined that maintenance should be carried out every 2 years.", "the monument was restored twice during the soviet era (1962 and 1980\u20131981).", "in keeping with tradition the restorations and maintenance after the renewal of latvia's independence are financed partly by private donations.", "the monument underwent major restoration in 1998\u20132001.", "during this restoration the statue of liberty and its stars were cleaned, restored and gilded anew.", "the monument was formally re-opened on july 24, 2001. the staircase, column, base and inside of the monument were restored, and the stone materials were cleaned and re-sealed.", "the supports of the monument were fixed to prevent subsidence.", "although the restorers said at the time that the monument would withstand a hundred years without another major restoration, it was discovered a few years later that the gilding of the stars was damaged, due to the restoration technique used.", "the stars were restored again during maintenance and restoration in 2006; however, this restoration was rushed and there is no warranty of its quality.", "as of 2016 the monument is regularly monitored and its lower part is cleaned and covered with a protective coating every five years.", "it is planned to carry out cleaning and restoration of entire monument in 2017.", "the guard of honor was present from the unveiling of the monument until 1940, when it was removed shortly after the occupation of latvia.", "it was renewed on november 11, 1992. the guards are soldiers of the guard of honor company of the staff battalion of

each other hourly in a ceremony commanded by the chief of the guard.", "besides them there also are two watchmen in each shift, who look out for the safety of the guards of honor.", "normally the guard changes every hour between 9\u00a0a.m. and 6\u00a0p.m. after an hour on watch the guards have two hours free that they spend in their rooms at the ministry of defence.", "since september 2004 the guards also patrol every half hour during their watch: they march off from the base of the monument and march twice along each side of it and then return to their posts.", "the guards are required to be at least 1.82 meters (6.0\u00a0ft) tall and in good health, as they are required to stand without moving for half an hour.", "after the end of world war ii, there were plans to demolish the monument, although little written evidence is available to historians and research is largely based on oral testimony.", "on september 29, 1949 (although according to oral testimony, the issue was first raised as early as october 1944) the council of people's commissars of the latvian ssr proposed the restoration of the statue of the russian emperor peter the great.", "while they did not expressly call for the demolition of the freedom monument, the only way to restore the statue to its original position would have been to tear down the monument.", "the result of the debate is unrecorded, but since the monument still stands the proposition was presumably rejected.", "the soviet sculptor vera mukhina (1889\u20131953; designer of the monumental sculpture worker and kolkhoz woman) is sometimes credited with the rescue of the monument, although there is no written evidence to support the fact.", "according to her son, she took part in a meeting where the fate of the monument was discussed, at which her opinion, as reported by her son, was that the monument was of very high artistic value and that its demolition might hurt the most sacred feelings of the latvian people.", "the freedom monument remained, but its symbolism was reinterpreted.", "the three stars were said to stand for the newly created baltic soviet republics \u2013 estonian ssr, latvian ssr, and lithuanian ssr \u2013 held aloft by mother russia, and the monument was said to have been erected after world war ii as a sign of popular gratitude toward the soviet leader joseph stalin for the liberation of the baltic states.", "in the middle of 1963, when the issue of demolition was raised again, it was decided that the destruction of a structure of such artistic and historic value, the building of which had been funded by donations of the residents of latvia, would only cause deep indignation, which in turn would cause tension in society.", "over time the misinterpretation of symbolism also was toned down and by 1988 the monument was said, with somewhat more accuracy, to have been built to \"celebrate the liberation from bondage of the autocracy of the tsar and german barons\", although withholding the fact that the bolshevik red army and the red latvian riflemen were also adversaries in the latvian war of independence.", "despite the soviet government's efforts, on june 14, 1987, about 5,000 people rallied to commemorate the those affected by soviet deportations.", "this event, organized by the human rights group helsinki-86, was the first time after the soviet occupation that the flower-laying ceremony took place, as the practice was banned by the soviet authorities.", "in response the soviet government organized a bicycle race at the monument at the time when the ceremony was planned to take place.", "helsinki-86 organized another flower-laying ceremony on august 23 in the same year to commemorate the anniversary of the molotov\u2013ribbentrop pact, at which the crowd was dispersed using jets of water.", "yet the independence movement grew in size, amounting in some events to more than half a million participants (about one quarter of latvia's population) and three years later, on may 4, 1990, the re-establishment of the independence of latvia was declared.", "since the re-establishment of independence the monument has become a focal point for a variety of events.", "one of these \u2013 on march 16, the commemoration day of veterans of the latvian legion of the waffen-ss, who fought the soviet union during world war ii \u2013 has caused controversy.", "the date was first celebrated by latvians in exile before being brought to latvia in 1990 and for a short time (1998\u20132000) was the official remembrance day.in 1998 the event drew the attention of the foreign mass media and in the following year the russian government condemned the event as a \"glorification of nazism\".", "the event evolved into a political conflict between latvians and russians, posing a threat to public safety.", "the latvian government took a number of steps in order to try to bring the situation under control, and in 2006 not only were the events planned by right wing organizations not approved, but the monument was fenced off, according to an announcement by riga city council, for restoration.", "the monument was indeed restored in 2006, but this statement was later questioned, as politicians named various other reasons for the change of date, the enclosed area was much larger than needed for restoration, and the weather appeared inappropriate for restoration work.", "therefore, the government was criticized by the latvian press for being unable to ensure public safety and freedom of speech.", "the unapproved
