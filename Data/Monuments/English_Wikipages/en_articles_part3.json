aljafer\u00eda, the most important of these sectors is the north, that in origin was endowed with a second plant and had greater depth, besides being preceded by an open and profusely decorated column

emulate.", "in this way, from the courtyard, it appeared half-hidden by the plots of columns of both the archway of access to the golden hall and those of the immediate portico, which gave an appearance of latticework, an illusion of depth, which admired the visitor and lent splendor to the figure of the monarch.", "in order to remember the appearance of the palace at the end of the 11th century, we must imagine that all the vegetal, geometric and epigraphic reliefs were polychromed in shades in which red and blue predominated for backgrounds and gold for reliefs, which, together with

with plaster, as well as an alabaster base of two and a half meters high and the white marble floors of the original palace, have been lost.", "the remains that have been preserved, both in museums and the few that are in this royal hall, nevertheless allow to reconstruct the appearance of this polychrome decoration, which, in its day, should have been splendid.", "ceilings, wood carvings, reproduced the sky, and the whole room was an image of the cosmos, clothed with symbols of the power exercised over the celestial universe by the monarch of saragossa, who thus appeared as heir to the caliphs.", "the access to the golden hall is made through a canvas with three vanes.", "a very large central one, consisting of five double marble columns with very stylized islamic alabaster capitals

portico of great polilobulated arcades.", "again there is a tripartite space, and its east and west ends extend perpendicularly with two lateral galleries which are accessed by wide polyhedral lobes and which end at the end of their arms in separate pointed arches also polilobulated whose alfiz is decorated by complex laqueus and reliefs of arabesques.", "this whole structure seeks an appearance of solemnity and majesty that the scant depth of these stays would not give a spectator to access the king's room.", "in addition, all the ornamentation of yeserias of the palace was polychrome in shades of blue and red in the back and gold in the arabesques.", "among the filigrees is the representation of a bird, an unusual zoomorphic figure in islamic art that could represent a pigeon, a pheasant or a symbol of the king as winged.", "the traces of interlocking mixtilinear arches are characteristic of this palace and are given for the first time in the aljafer\u00eda, from where they will be diffused to the future islamic constructions.", "on the eastern side of the portico is a sacred space, the mosque, which is accessed through a portal inspired by caliph art and described below.", "at the eastern end of the entrance portico to the golden hall, there is a small mosque or private oratory for use by the monarch and his courtiers.", "it is accessed through a portal that ends in a horseshoe arch inspired by the mosque of c\u00f3rdoba but with s-shaped springers, a novelty that will imitate the almoravid art and nasrid art.", "this arch rests on two columns with capitals of leaves very geometricals, in the line of the realizations granadan art of solutions in moc\u00e1rabe.", "its alfiz is profusely ornamented with vegetal decoration and on it is arranged a frieze of half-point arcs crossed.", "already inside the oratory there is a reduced space of square plant but with chamfered corners, that turns it into a false octagonal plant.", "in the southeast sector, oriented towards mecca, is located the niche of the mihrab.", "the front of the mihrab is conformed by a very traditional horseshoe arch, with cordoban shapes and alternating camouflage threads, some decorated with vegetal reliefs and other smooth ones (although originally they were decorated with pictorial decoration), reminiscent of the mihrab thread of the mosque of c\u00f3rdoba, only what were rich materials (mosaics and byzantine bricklayers) in zaragoza, with greater material poverty than the caliphian c\u00f3rdoba, are plaster stucco and polychrome, the latter having been lost in almost the entire palace.", "continuing with the arch of the portal, an alfiz framed its back, in whose curved triangles two mirrored rosettes are recessed, as is the dome of the interior of the mihrab.", "the rest of the walls of the mosque are decorated with blind mixtilineal arches linked and decorated throughout the surface with vegetable arabesques of caliph's inspiration.", "these arches lean on columns topped with capitals of slender basket.", "a slab of square marble slabs covers the bottom of the walls of the mosque.", "all this is topped with a splendid theory of interlocking polyblocked arches, which, in this case, are not blind in their entirety, because those in the chamfered corners let now see the angles of the square plant structure.", "this gallery is the only one that conserves remains of the pictorial decoration of the 11th century, whose motives were rescued by francisco \u00ed\u00f1iguez almech after removing the liming with which they were covered after the passage of the aljafer\u00eda to chapel.", "unfortunately, this restorer, praiseworthy for having saved from the ruin of the monument, worked in an age of different criteria to the present ones, because he intended to restore all the elements to their original appearance.", "for this he repainted with acrylic paint the traces of islamic remains, which makes this performance irreversible and, consequently, we will never see the, although very faded, original pigment.", "the dome of the mosque was not preserved, because that is the height in which the palace of the catholic monarchs was built; however, the characteristic octagonal plant suggests that the solution should follow literally the existing ones in the maqsurah of the mosque of c\u00f3rdoba, that is to say, a dome of semicircular arches that are interlaced forming an octagon in the center.", "the covering proposal of francisco \u00ed\u00f1iguez is, however, in this case, reversible, as it is a detachable dome of plaster.", "in 2006, bernab\u00e9 caba\u00f1ero subiza, c. lasa gracia and j. l. mateo l\u00e1zaro postulated that \"the nerves of the vault [...] should have the section of horseshoe arches forming an eight-pointed star pattern with a dome agglomerated in the center, as those existing in the two domes of the transept of the mosque of c\u00f3rdoba.", "completing the tour of the 11th-century palace, one arrives at the south portico, which consists of an arcade on its southern flank that gives access to a portico with two lateral stays.", "this portico was the vestibule of a great south hall that would have the same tripartite disposition of the existent one in the north side, and of which only the arcades of access of mixtilineal arches of geometric decoration remains.", "perhaps in this southern sector the greatest daring in arches, through the interlocking of lobulated forms, mixtilinea[check spelling], and the inclusion of small reliefs of shafts and capitals with exclusively ornamental function.", "the complexity of laqueus, arabesques and carvings leads to a baroque aesthetic, which is a prelude to the filigree of the art of the alhambra and which are some of the most beautiful of all al-andalusian art.", "it is the open and landscaped space that unified the whole taifal palace.", "to it would pour the north and south porticos, and probably rooms and outbuildings to the east and west of this central courtyard.", "its name comes from the birth in the aljafer\u00eda of the infanta elizabeth of aragon, that was in 1282 queen of portugal.", "the original pool of the south has been conserved, whereas the one of the north front, of the 14th century, has been covered with a wood floor.", "the restoration tried to give the courtyard the original splendor, and for that a marble floor was arranged in the corridors that surround the orange and flower garden.", "the arcade that is contemplated looking towards the south portico is restored by means of the emptying of the original arcs that are deposited in the national archaeological museum of madrid and in the museo de zaragoza .", "they suppose the greater audacity and distance for their innovation with respect to the caliphs models of the arcades of the north side.", "according to christian ewert, who has studied for fifteen years the arches of the aljafer\u00eda, the more related to noble zones (golden hall and mosque) are the ornaments of the arcades, more respect they have to the c\u00f3rdoban tradition from which they leave.", "after the taking of saragossa by alfonso the battler in 1118, the aljafer\u00eda was habilitated like palace of the kings of aragon and like church, not being substantially modified until the 14th century with the performance of peter iv of aragon \"the ceremonious\".", "this king extended the palatial dependencies in 1336 and had constructed the church of san mart\u00edn in the entrance courtyard to the alc\u00e1zar.", "in this time the use of the aljafer\u00eda is documented like place of departure of the route that took to cathedral of the savior of zaragoza, where the aragonese monarchs were solemnly crowned and they swore the fueros of aragon.", "the chapel of san mart\u00edn takes advantage of the canvases of the northwest corner of the wall, to the point that one of its towers was used as sacristy and gave name to the courtyard that gives access to the taifal enclosure.", "the factory, of gothic-mud\u00e9jar style, consists of two naves of three sections each, in origin orientated to the east and supported in two pillars with semicolumns attached in the half of the faces of the pillar, whose section is remembered in the quadrilobed that shelter the shield of arms of the king of aragon in the spandrels of the portal, that is already of the first decade of the 15th century and in which we will stop later.", "the vaults of these naves, of simple rib vault, are lodged on formeros arches and pointed perpia\u00f1os arches, whereas the diagonals are of half point.", "at the corners of the vaults appear florets with the coat of arms of the aragonese monarchy.", "of its decoration only fragments of the pictorial covering and some mixtilineal arches are preserved directly inspired in the muslim palace.", "it emphasizes in the exterior the mud\u00e9jar portal of brick referred to previously, built in the time of martin of aragon \"the humane\" and opened in the last section of the south nave.", "this portal is articulated by a carpanel arch very recessed, covered by another pointed of greater dimensions.", "framing both, a double alfiz decorated with taqueado jaqu\u00e9s motifs forming lozenge cloths.", "in the spandrels, as it was pointed out, two quadrilobed medallions appear that harbor shields with the image of the insignia of king of aragon.", "in the resulting tympanum between the arches there is a band of interlocking mixtilineal blind arches, which again refer to the series of the banu hud palace.", "this strip is interrupted by a box that houses a newly incorporated relief.", "the chapel was remodeled in the 18th century, placing a nave ahead of it and covering the mud\u00e9jar portal previously described.", "the pillars and walls were refurbished and plastered to the neoclassical style.", "all the reform was eliminated during the restorations of francisco \u00ed\u00f1iguez, although by the existing photographic documentation, it is known that there was a slender tower that now appears with a crenellated finish inspired by the aspect of the mud\u00e9jar church, and in the 18th century culminated with a curious bulbous spire.", "it is not an independent palace, but an extension of the muslim palace that was still in use.", "peter iv of aragon tried to provide more spacious rooms, dining rooms and bedrooms to the aljafer\u00eda, because the taifal bedrooms had remained small for the use of the ceremonious.", "these new rooms are grouped on the northern sector of the al-andalusian palace, at different levels of height.", "this new mud\u00e9jar factory was extraordinarily respectful of the pre-existing construction, both in plan and elevation, and is made up of three large rectangular halls covered by extraordinary aljarfes or wooden mud\u00e9jar ceilings.", "also from this time is the western arcade of pointed arches of the patio de santa isabel, intrados in lobed arcs, and a small bedroom of square plant and covered with an octagonal dome of wood and a curious door of entrance in pointed arc of lobed intrados circumscribed in a very fine alfiz, whose spandrel is decked out of arabesque.", "this door leads to a triple lodge of semicircular arches.", "the bedroom is located on the building block above the mosque.", "in the last years of the 15th century the catholic monarchs ordered to construct a palace for royal use on the north wing of the al-andalusian enclosure, configuring a second plant superposed to the one of the existing palace.", "the building broke the high parts of the taifal stays, where inserted the beams that would support the new palace.", "the works are dated between 1488 and 1495 and were followed by mud\u00e9jar masters, maintained the tradition of mud\u00e9jar bricklayers in the aljafer\u00eda.", "the palace is accessed by climbing the noble staircase, a monumental building composed of two large sections with geometric yeserias gables illuminated by half-angled windows of small decoration of leaves and stems of gothic roots and mud\u00e9jar influences, topped in crochet on the key of the arches.", "the grandiose ceiling, as in the rest of the palace buildings, is covered with superb cross-vaulted vaults arranged between the j\u00e1cenas, and they are decorated with tempera painting with iconographic motifs related to the catholic monarchs: the yoke and the arrows alternate with squares of decoration in grisao of grotesques and candelieri, that announces the typical decoration of the renaissance.", "the stairs give access to a corridor in the first floor that communicates with the palatial dependencies proper.", "it opens to a gallery of columns of torso stem that rest on shoes with anthropomorphic reliefs at their ends.", "to support this viewpoint and the rest of the new dependencies it was necessary to section the high areas of the taifal halls of the 11th century and to have before the north portico five powerful octagonal pillars that, next to some archways pointed behind them, form a new antepartum that unites the two al-andalusian perpendicular pavilions above.", "it emphasizes the main entrance to the throne room: a trilobed recessed arch with a five-lobed tympanum, at the center of which is represented the coat of arms of the monarchy of the catholic monarchs, which includes the coats of arms of the kingdoms of castile, le\u00f3n, aragon, sicily and granada, supported by two lieutenant lions.", "the rest of the decorative field is finished with a delicate vegetal ornamentation of stamped invoice, which reappears in the capitals of the jambs.", "the entire portal is made of hardened plaster, which is the predominant material in the interior of the aljafer\u00eda, as mud\u00e9jar craftsmen perpetuate the materials and techniques that are common in islam.", "in the same wall, two large windows of triple mixtilineal arc with shutters on their keys are escorted by the entrance, thanks to which the inner space of the royal rooms is illuminated.", "once the space of the gallery is crossed, several rooms are arranged that precede to the great throne room, that are denominated \"rooms of the lost steps\".", "these are three small rooms of square plan communicated to each other by big windows shut with lattices that give to the patio de san mart\u00edn, and that served as waiting rooms for those who were to be received in audience by the kings.", "in our days only two are visible, because the third one was closed when replacing the dome of the mosque.", "its roof was moved to a room adjoining the throne room.", "one of the most valuable elements of these rooms are their floors, which originally were square azulejos and hexagonal ceramic alfardones glazed in colors, forming capricious borders.", "they were made in the historic pottery of loza de muel at the end of the 15th century.", "from the preserved fragments has been set to restore the entire floor with ceramics that mimics the shape and layout of the former floor, but not its quality glazed reflections.", "the other remarkable element is its excellent mud\u00e9jar-catholic monarchs style roofs, constituted by three magnificent taujeles of aragonese mud\u00e9jar carpenters.", "these ceilings present geometric reticules of wood later carved, painted and gilded with gold leaf, whose moldings show the well-known heraldic motifs of the catholic monarchs: the yoke, the arrows and the gordian knot united to the classic motto \"tanto monta\" (both mounts to undo the gordian knot), both mounts to cut it as to untie it, according to the well-known anecdote attributed to alexander the great), as well as a good number of leaflet florets finished with pendant (pinjante\u00a0[es]) pineapples.", "more complex and difficult to describe is the magnificence and sumptuousness of the ceiling that covers the throne room.", "its dimensions are very considerable (20 metres (66 feet) in length by 8 in width) and its artesonado coffered ceiling is supported by thick beams and sleepers decorated with laqueus that at intersections form eight-pointed stars, while generating thirty large and deep square coffins.", "inside these coffins are inscribed octagons with a central flower of curly leaf that finish in large hanging pine cones that symbolize fertility and immortality.", "this ceiling was reflected in the ground, which reproduces the thirty squares with their respective octagons inscribed.", "under the artesonado coffered ceiling there is an airy gallery of passable arches and with open windows, from which the guests could contemplate the royal ceremonies.", "finally, all this structure is based on an arrocabe with moldings in carved navicella with vegetal and zoomorphic themes (cardina, branches, fruits of the vine, winged dragons, fantastic animals...), and in the frieze that surrounds the whole perimeter of the room, there appears a legend of gothic calligraphy that reads:", "ferdinandus, hispaniarum, siciliae, corsicae, balearumque rex, principum optimus,

of 1486, the area of the patio de san mart\u00edn was destined to the headquarters of the tribunal of the holy office of the inquisition and facilities were installed adjacent to the courtyard to house the officers of this organization.", "it is likely that this is the origin of the use as a prison of the tower of the troubadour.", "the new function (which lasted until the early-18th century) triggered an event that would culminate in a reform project undertaken under the mandate of philip ii of spain by which he would henceforth become a military base.", "in 1591, in the events known as the alterations of aragon, the persecuted secretary of king philip ii, antonio p\u00e9rez took refuge at the privilege of manifestation contemplated by the fuero of aragon in order to elude the imperial troops.", "however, the tribunal of the inquisition had jurisdiction over all the fueros of the kingdoms, and, for that reason, he was held in a cell of the inquisitorial headquarters of the aljafer\u00eda, which provoked an uprising of the people before what they considered a violation of the foral law, and they went to the assault of the aljafer\u00eda to rescue him.", "after the forceful action of the royal army, the revolt was put down, and philip ii decided to consolidate the aljafer\u00eda as a fortified citadel under his authority to prevent similar revolts.", "the design of the work, which consisted of a military construction, was entrusted to the italian-sienese military engineer, tiburzio spannocchi.", "he constructed a set of habitat attached to the south and east walls that hid the ultrasemicircular turrets in its interior, although in the east fa\u00e7ade it did not affect those who flanked the entrance door and these onwards.", "surrounding the entire building, a marlon wall was erected leaving inside a round space and ending at its four corners in four pentagonal bastions, whose starts can be seen today.", "the entire complex was surrounded by a moat twenty meters wide, which was saved by two drawbridges on the east and north flanks.", "the aljafer\u00eda remained without substantial changes until 1705, in which due to the war of spanish succession it was lodging of two companies of french troops that took to a regrowth of the parapets of the low wall of the pit effected by the military engineer dezveheforz.", "but the decisive transformation as quartering took place in 1772 at the initiative of charles iii of spain, in which all the facades were remodeled to the way in which the western one is presently, and that the interior spaces were used as dependencies for the soldiers and officers who were staying in the building.", "in the western third of the palace was set up a large courtyard to which the rooms of the

spacious passage, working as a covered street: it must be reminded that the original surroundings of oviedo cathedral were cluttered with houses, and the walkable areas were very narrow, so this street-like narthex provided an interesting, urbanistic solution.", "initially, this narthex was going to be topped by two twin towers, but after 1507 the oviedo episcopate decided to build only a tower, which would be erected over the narthex's southern gate: despite traditional accounts, this decision did not respond to a lack of funds, because the cathedral was actually a well-financed

perimeter, was dedicated to the valley's eponymous goddess murcia, an obscure deity associated with venus, the myrtle shrub, a sacred spring, the stream that divided the valley, and the lesser peak of the aventine hill.", "the other was at the southeastern turning-post; where there was an underground shrine to consus, a minor god of grain-stores, connected to the grain-goddess ceres and to the underworld.", "according to roman tradition, romulus discovered this shrine shortly after the founding of rome.", "he invented the consualia festival, as a way of gathering his sabine neighbours at a celebration that included horse-races and drinking.", "during these distractions, romulus's men then abducted the sabine daughters as brides.", "thus the famous roman myth of the rape of the sabine women had as its setting the circus and the consualia.", "in this quasi-legendary era, horse or chariot races would have been held at the circus site.", "the track width may have been determined by the distance between murcia's and consus' shrines at the southeastern end, and its length by the distance between these two shrines and hercules' ara maxima, supposedly older than rome itself and sited behind the circus' starting place.", "the position of consus' shrine at the turn of the track recalls the placing of shrines to roman neptune's greek equivalent, poseidon, in greek hippodromes.", "in later developments, the altar of consus, as one of the circus' patron deities, was incorporated into the fabric of the south-eastern turning post.", "when murcia's stream was partly built over, to form a dividing barrier (the spina or euripus) between the turning posts, her shrine was either retained or rebuilt.", "in the late imperial period, both the southeastern turn and the circus itself were sometimes known as vallis murcia.", "the symbols used to count race-laps also held religious significance; castor and pollux, who were born from an egg, were patrons of horses, horsemen, and the equestrian order (equites).", "likewise, the later use of dolphin-shaped lap counters reinforced associations between the races, swiftness, and neptune, as god of earthquakes and horses; the romans believed dolphins to be the swiftest of all creatures.", "when the romans adopted the phrygian great mother as an ancestral deity, a statue of her on lion-back was erected within the circus, probably on the dividing barrier.", "sun and moon cults were probably represented at the circus from its earliest phases.", "their importance grew with the introduction of roman cult to apollo, and the development of stoic and solar monism as a theological basis for the roman imperial cult.", "in the imperial era, the sun-god was divine patron of the circus and its games.", "his sacred obelisk towered over the arena, set in the central barrier, close to his temple and the finishing line.", "the sun-god was the ultimate, victorious charioteer, driving his four-horse chariot (quadriga) through the heavenly circuit from sunrise to sunset.", "his partner luna drove her two-horse chariot (biga); together, they represented the predictable, orderly movement of the cosmos and the circuit of time, which found analogy in the circus track.", "in imperial cosmology, the emperor was sol-apollo's earthly equivalent, and luna may have been linked to the empress.", "[citation

represented in the processions that started circus games, and with sol indiges, usually identified as her brother.", "after the loss of her temple, her cult may have been transferred to sol's temple on the dividing barrier, or one beside it; both would have been open to the sky.", "temples to several deities overlooked the circus; most are now lost.", "the temples to ceres and flora stood close together on the aventine, more or less opposite the circus' starting gate, which remained under hercules' protection.", "further southeast along the aventine was a temple to luna, the moon goddess.",
