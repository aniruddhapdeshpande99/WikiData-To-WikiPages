building works were managed by the brother, who commissioned the project to his friend, the architect puig i cadafalch which concurred with ideas as current as giving a central european vision to the three houses which together form la casa de les punxes.", "in late 1903, josep puig i cadafalch came across the commission to design a house for each of the sisters terradas brutau on the terrain located between the carrer rossell\u00f3 avinguda diagonal and carrer bruc.", "it was an atypical solar, irregularly shaped fruit of the recent urbanized eixample.", "the architect created an interesting project with a medieval feel, seamlessly blending the three buildings to look like a single house, a single building block.", "the building was to be built on a triangular site, which meant the architect could not follow cerd\u00e0s' urban plan.", "the new design was inspired by the wagner-inspired fashion in northern europe, a block with 6 corners, coinciding with the intersection of the three surrounding streets avinguda diagonal, carrer rossell\u00f3 and carrer bruc of barcelona.", "the will of the architect was to structurally and architecturally appear like a detached building; however decorative elements also make reference to the ownership of the houses.", "for example, on the fa\u00e7ade of the corner of carrer rossell\u00f3 with avinguda diagonal, which belongs to number 420 in diagonal street, there is an interesting sculptural panel of enric monserd\u00e0\u2013\u2013work in which an angel is depicted, figure that clearly refers to the owner of this

additional ceramic panels.", "in one there is a vase full of roses, with rtb initials, on the other, the figure of a girl surrounded by roses.", "this property belonged to the sister rosa terradas brutau.", "in all the symbolic elements of casa terradas we find other representations, both in sculptures, forge or glass work, which can conduct a symbolic reading, whether it is religious or mythological.throughout the various fa\u00e7ades comprising the house, male figures are represented, some with horns; others, with a more particular physiognomy, and sailor's knots.", "vegetables are the most recurrent elements: fruits, like apples or pomegranates, as well as daisies, roses or clovers.", "puig i cadafalch decided to break with the building tradition that dominated so far.he opted to eliminate the traditional load-bearing walls being replaced by cast iron pillars and metal beams on the ground floor, which provided an airy feel to the space (these premises were for commercial rental) and a total open plan distribution, detached from the strong constraint posed by load-bearing walls.", "since the three owners of the house terradas died childless, the building was taken over by their brother and sole heir, bartomeu terradas brutau.", "in 1975, the building was declared a national historic monument and, in 1976, a cultural asset of national interest.", "in 1991, when la

2016 onwards.", "the intervention of enric monserd\u00e0 in casa terradas of barcelona was very important.", "we can say that, together with josep puig i cadafalch, monserd\u00e0 was the great ideologue of the house.on the completion of the construction works of the first of three houses, monserd\u00e0 set up his studio-workshop in one of the round ends of la casa terradas on the corner of avinguda diagonal with carrer rossell\u00f3", "thus, his designs are the decorative elements of artificial stone that fill the fa\u00e7ade, the ceramic panels of sant jordi, the angel and the roses, and the design of the windows and elements of artificial iron.", "monserd\u00e0 was also the designer of much of the furniture made for the floors of the terradas family as well as the neo-gothic

rehabilitation process is to recover the essence of the modernista building and the figure of puig i cadafalch.on the ground floor, after eliminating the dividing walls and ceilings, the resulting open space revalues the original columns that the architect introduced to replace the bearing walls, one of the most important contributions of the time.", "the rehabilitation works being carried out

area.", "therefore, the columns placed by the original architect, which was the most important innovation of the time, will regain prominence.", "at this time, the entire base structure endured
