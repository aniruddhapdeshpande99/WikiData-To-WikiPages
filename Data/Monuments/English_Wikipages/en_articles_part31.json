planes of being.", "... what is considered a monument always depends on the importance it attributes to the prevailing or traditional consciousness of a specific historical and social situation.\u201d", "basically, the definition framework of the term monument depends on the current historical frame conditions.", "aspects of the culture of remembrance and cultural memory are also linked to it, as well as questions about the concepts of public sphere and durability (of the one memorized) and the form and content of the monument (work-like monument).", "from an art historical

numerous statues of lenin in the soviet union.", "they can be used to educate the populace about important events or figures from the past, such as in the renaming of the old general post office building in new york city to the james a. farley building (james farley post office), after former postmaster general james farley.", "to fulfill its informative and educative functions a monument needs to be open to the public, which means that its spatial dimension as well as its content can be experienced by the public, and be sustainable.", "the former may be achieved either by situating
