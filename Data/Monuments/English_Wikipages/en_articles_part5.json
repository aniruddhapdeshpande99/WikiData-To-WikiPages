or as the great mother feeding her children in daumier's study republic from the mus\u00e9e d\u2019orsay.", "these and similar allegorical depictions of france as a determined female figure with the characteristic phrygian bonnet are clear historical references of relevance for me\u0161trovi\u0107's conception of the monument in kalemegdan.", "the manner of formal stylization and the force of movement bring the figure close to the sezession style.", "the logic of its vigorous forward motion, which can be traced back to late hellenistic sculpture, is based on placing the entire weight of the figure on the left foot and establishing static equilibrium between dominant planes: between twisted masses of the upper body with the jutting right shoulder and the long taut arc of the right leg, and the cumulative mass of the drapery and left arm.", "the arrangement of the main planes and the lateral location of reliefs shift the beholder's viewpoint to the sides of the monument.", "even though the side aspect is visually richer, me\u0161trovi\u0107 established the (ideal) frontal viewpoint in order to emphasize the dignity and importance of the central figure.", "a shift away from naturalism and elements of modern inspiration are most readily observable in the treatment of drapery, which assumes a fantastic shape which, viewed from the rear, makes the figure almost unrecognizable.", "the fusion of the left arm with the drapery serves to produce an almost aerodynamic form, with the horizontal lineation of the drapery folds suggesting the force of movement which almost lifts the figure into the air.", "the use of the drapery folds suggests the author's idea to evocation of wings, thereby coming closer to the ideal of victory, the famous late hellenistic winged nike of samothrace.", "the central bronze figure is 4.35\u00a0m (14.3\u00a0ft) tall, 4\u00a0m (13\u00a0ft) wide and weights 4 tons.", "it is situated on the 7-metre-high (23\u00a0ft)

deducted the defensive, symbolic and administrative functions of the walled enclosure.", "in madrid, similarly, the walls were built to protect the fundamental area of the city -not only from external danger, but also from potential internal revolts in the suburbs (also possibly walled).", "the differentiation of spaces produced by the walls, thanks to the gates -three in this case- also aided the implementation of taxes.", "thus, the city was divided between the medina or center of religious and commercial life, and the rabad, the \"populous neighborhoods outside the walls\".", "from a planning point of view, the walls promoted urbanism through its gates and its path: its gates because through it would run the streets of greater affluence and its layout because the neighborhoods would range around it.", "in this section we could also talk about different possibilities when building walls, from the materials used to various designs to suit the terrain.", "however, there are many other models that serve as examples.", "the construction of these walls is directly linked to the origin of madrid.", "they were ordered built by the c\u00f3rdoban emir muhammad i (852 - 886) on

greater fortification there.", "to the west, the cliffs located on the plain of manzanares river constituted a natural defense of the alc\u00e1zar; a similar function was served by the ravines and

access, according to data from the excavations, would have been 4.5 and 3.5 meters (15 and 11\u00a0ft).", "typologically it is a narrow gate, between two towers and a poorly developed.", "after the

accessibility to visitors.", "the excavations carried out there in 1972-1975 and 1985 onwards have been aided by the demolition of a 19th-century building that sat on the stretch itself, revealing a

foundation should not be overlooked, because all the walls might have also had such a fate.", "apparently, many sections of the walls were rebuilt and remodeled as well, and others may have suffered worse in the course of history.", "it is a stretch of a width around 2.6 meters (8\u00a0ft 6\u00a0in), which is quite consistent if put in relation to the size of the towers that are around it.", "there are two exterior walls that have inside masonry to mode of core.", "the masonry is linked with lime mortar.", "it is of note that all materials that make the stretch could be found relatively close to the city areas, which reaffirms once again the geostrategic role of the rise in which emerged the islamic city.", "deepening in the two facing walls, its bottoms are formed by large blocks of flint, cut only on its outer face and slightly trimmed, but not modeling, inside.", "from there rise ashlars of limestone, providing a new finding that the track is of al-andalusian origin, because the materials follow the style of cordoban rigging, which is a constant in the centuries in which life unfolds in madrid.", "the c\u00f3rdoban rigging is an ashlar to rope -the longest part of it abroad - and two or three blight, the short side visible.", "this is difficult to appreciate along the stretch, because the passage of time.", "in fact, it is possible that the walls was remodeled in the 10th century after a siege of ramiro ii of le\u00f3n, but never possible that was rebuilt.", "finding on foot of wall the c\u00f3rdoban rigging may be difficult, because when it put in value in the late 1980s was applied a render in white, if it was on track to hide some patches implanted in the wall during its time as load-bearing wall also hid some details.", "on the other hand, the small arch that can be seen capping could be a sort of drain without interest, which follows the documentation of modern times, which marks the passage of a small stream by that area.", "to try to provide a more historical perspective was recreated a small slope to try to rebuild the period atmosphere, as transformed by the growth of madrid.", "the calle bail\u00e9n n.\u00ba 12 is a building founded on
