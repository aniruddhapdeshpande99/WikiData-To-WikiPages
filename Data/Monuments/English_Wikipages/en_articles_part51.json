3,000\u00a0\u00b0c (3,270\u00a0k; 5,430\u00a0\u00b0f) and flowing at a speed of 6\u00a0km/s (3.7\u00a0mi/s) (compared to 10\u00a0m/s (33\u00a0ft/s) outside the ribbon).", "the processes that cause steve also are associated with a picket-fence aurora, although the latter can be seen without steve.", "it is an aurora because it is caused by precipitation of electrons in the atmosphere but it appears outside the auroral oval, closer to the equator than typical auroras.", "when the picket-fence aurora appears with steve, it is below.", "a full understanding of the physical processes which lead to different types of auroras is still incomplete, but the basic cause involves the interaction of the solar wind with the earth's magnetosphere.", "the varying intensity of the solar wind produces effects of different magnitudes but includes one or more of the following physical scenarios.", "the details of these phenomena are not fully understood.", "however, it is clear that the prime source of auroral particles is the solar wind feeding the magnetosphere, the reservoir containing the radiation zones and temporarily magnetically-trapped particles confined by the geomagnetic field, coupled with particle acceleration processes.", "the immediate cause of the ionization and excitation of atmospheric constituents leading to auroral emissions was discovered in 1960, when a pioneering rocket flight from fort churchill in canada revealed a flux of electrons entering the atmosphere from above.", "since then an extensive collection of measurements has been acquired painstakingly and with steadily improving resolution since the 1960s by many research teams using rockets and satellites to traverse the auroral zone.", "the main findings have been that auroral arcs and other bright forms are due to electrons that have been accelerated during the final few 10,000\u00a0km or so of their plunge into the atmosphere.", "these electrons often, but not always, exhibit a peak in their energy distribution, and are preferentially aligned along the local direction of the magnetic field.electrons mainly responsible for diffuse and pulsating auroras have, in contrast, a smoothly falling energy distribution, and an angular (pitch-angle) distribution favouring directions perpendicular to the local magnetic field.", "pulsations were discovered to originate at or close to the equatorial crossing point of auroral zone magnetic field lines.", "protons are also associated with auroras, both discrete and diffuse.", "auroras result from emissions of photons in the earth's upper atmosphere, above 80\u00a0km (50\u00a0mi), from ionized nitrogen atoms regaining an electron, and oxygen atoms and nitrogen based molecules returning from an excited state to ground state.", "they are ionized or excited by the collision of particles precipitated into the atmosphere.", "both incoming electrons and protons may be involved.", "excitation energy is lost within the atmosphere by the emission of a photon, or by collision with another atom or molecule:", "oxygen is unusual in terms of its return to ground state: it can take 0.7 seconds to emit the 557.7\u00a0nm green light and up to two minutes for the red 630.0\u00a0nm emission.", "collisions with other atoms or molecules absorb the excitation energy and prevent emission, this process is called collisional quenching.", "because the highest parts of the atmosphere contain a higher percentage of oxygen and lower particle densities, such collisions are rare enough to allow time for oxygen to emit red light.", "collisions become more frequent progressing down into the atmosphere due to increasing density, so that red emissions do not have time to happen, and eventually, even green light emissions are prevented.this is why there is a color differential with altitude; at high altitudes oxygen red dominates, then oxygen green and nitrogen blue/purple/red, then finally nitrogen blue/purple/red when collisions prevent oxygen from emitting anything.", "green is the most common color.", "then comes pink, a mixture of light green and red, followed by pure red, then yellow (a mixture of red and green), and finally, pure blue.", "bright auroras are generally associated with birkeland currents (schield et al., 1969; zmuda and armstrong, 1973), which flow down into the ionosphere on one side of the pole and out on the other.", "in between, some of the current connects directly through the ionospheric e layer (125\u00a0km); the rest (\"region 2\") detours, leaving again through field lines closer to the equator and closing through the \"partial ring current\" carried by magnetically trapped plasma.", "the ionosphere is an ohmic conductor, so some consider that such currents require a driving voltage, which an, as yet unspecified, dynamo mechanism can supply.", "electric field probes in orbit above the polar cap suggest voltages of the order of 40,000 volts, rising up to more than 200,000 volts during intense magnetic storms.", "in another interpretation, the currents are the direct result of electron acceleration into the atmosphere by wave/particle interactions.", "ionospheric resistance has a complex nature, and leads to a secondary hall current flow.", "by a strange twist of physics, the magnetic disturbance on the ground due to the main current almost cancels out, so most of the observed effect of auroras is due to a secondary current, the auroral electrojet.", "an auroral electrojet index (measured in nanotesla) is regularly derived from ground data and serves as a general measure of auroral activity.", "kristian birkeland deduced that the currents flowed in the east\u2013west directions along the auroral arc, and such currents, flowing from the dayside toward (approximately) midnight were later named \"auroral electrojets\" (see also birkeland currents).", "the earth is constantly immersed in the solar wind, a rarefied flow of hot plasma (a gas of free electrons and positive ions) emitted by the sun in all directions, a result of the two-million-degree temperature of the sun's outermost layer, the corona.", "the solar wind reaches earth with a velocity typically around 400\u00a0km/s, a density of around 5 ions/cm3 and a magnetic field intensity of around 2\u20135 nt (for comparison, earth's surface field is typically 30,000\u201350,000 nt).", "during magnetic storms, in particular, flows can be several times faster; the interplanetary magnetic field (imf) may also be much stronger.", "joan feynman deduced in the 1970s that the long-term averages of solar wind speed correlated with geomagnetic activity.", "her work resulted from data collected by the explorer 33 spacecraft.the solar wind and magnetosphere consist of plasma (ionized gas), which conducts electricity.", "it is well known (since michael faraday's work around 1830) that when an electrical conductor is placed within a magnetic field while relative motion occurs in a direction that the conductor cuts across (or is cut by), rather than along, the lines of the magnetic field, an electric current is induced within the conductor.", "the strength of the current depends on a) the rate of relative motion, b) the strength of the magnetic field, c) the number of conductors ganged together and d) the distance between the conductor and the magnetic field, while the direction of flow is dependent upon the direction of relative motion.", "dynamos make use of this basic process (\"the dynamo effect\"), any and all conductors, solid or otherwise are so affected, including plasmas and other fluids.the imf originates on the sun, linked to the sunspots, and its field lines (lines of force) are dragged out by the solar wind.", "that alone would tend to line them up in the sun-earth direction, but the rotation of the sun angles them at earth by about 45 degrees forming a spiral in the ecliptic plane), known as the parker spiral.", "the field lines passing earth are therefore usually linked to those near the western edge (\"limb\") of the visible sun at any time.the solar wind and the magnetosphere, being two electrically conducting fluids in relative motion, should be able in principle to generate electric currents by dynamo action and impart energy from the flow of the solar wind.", "however, this process is hampered by the fact that plasmas conduct readily along magnetic field lines, but less readily perpendicular to them.", "energy is more effectively transferred by the temporary magnetic connection between the field lines of the solar wind and those of the magnetosphere.", "unsurprisingly this process is known as magnetic reconnection.", "as already mentioned, it happens most readily when the interplanetary field is directed southward, in a similar direction to the geomagnetic field in the inner regions of both the north magnetic pole and south magnetic pole.", "auroras are more frequent and brighter during the intense phase of the solar cycle when coronal mass ejections increase the intensity of the solar wind.", "earth's magnetosphere is shaped by the impact of the solar wind on the earth's magnetic field.", "this forms an obstacle to the flow, diverting it, at an average distance of about 70,000\u00a0km (11 earth radii or re), producing a bow shock 12,000\u00a0km to 15,000\u00a0km (1.9 to 2.4 re) further upstream.", "the width of the magnetosphere abreast of earth, is typically 190,000\u00a0km (30 re), and on the night side a long \"magnetotail\" of stretched field lines extends to

density, and speed in the solar wind.", "this flow is favored by a southward component of the imf, which can then directly connect to the high latitude geomagnetic field lines.", "the flow pattern of magnetospheric plasma is mainly from the magnetotail toward the earth, around the earth and back into the solar wind through the magnetopause on the day-side.", "in addition to moving perpendicular to the earth's magnetic field, some magnetospheric plasma travels down along the earth's magnetic field lines, gains additional energy and loses it to the atmosphere in the auroral zones.", "the cusps of the magnetosphere, separating geomagnetic field lines that close through the earth from those that close remotely allow a small amount of solar wind to directly reach the top of the atmosphere,

positioned approximately one third the distance to the moon, measured events suggesting a magnetic reconnection event 96 seconds prior to auroral intensification.", "geomagnetic storms that ignite auroras may occur more often during the months around the equinoxes.", "it is not well understood, but geomagnetic storms may vary with earth's seasons.", "two factors to consider are the tilt of both the solar and earth's axis to the ecliptic plane.", "as the earth orbits throughout a year, it experiences an interplanetary magnetic field (imf) from different latitudes of the sun, which is tilted at 8 degrees.", "similarly, the 23-degree tilt of the earth's axis about which the geomagnetic pole rotates with a diurnal variation changes the daily average angle that the geomagnetic field presents to the incident imf throughout a year.", "these factors combined can lead to minor cyclical changes in the detailed way that the imf links to the magnetosphere.", "in turn, this affects the average probability of opening a door through which energy from the solar wind can reach the earth's inner magnetosphere and thereby enhance auroras.", "the electrons responsible for the brightest forms of the aurora are well accounted for by their acceleration in the dynamic electric fields of plasma turbulence encountered during precipitation from the magnetosphere into the auroral atmosphere.", "in contrast, static electric fields are unable to transfer energy to the electrons due to their conservative nature.", "the electrons and ions that cause the diffuse aurora appear not to be accelerated during precipitation.the increase in strength of magnetic field lines towards the earth creates a 'magnetic mirror' that turns back many of the downward flowing electrons.", "the bright forms of auroras are produced when downward acceleration not only increases the energy of precipitating electrons but also reduces their pitch angles (angle between electron velocity and the local magnetic field vector).", "this greatly increases the rate of deposition of energy into the atmosphere, and thereby the rates of ionization, excitation and consequent emission of auroral light.", "acceleration also increases the electron current flowing between the atmosphere and magnetosphere.", "one early theory proposed for the acceleration of auroral electrons is based on an assumed static, or quasi-static, electric field creating a uni-directional potential drop.", "no mention is provided of either the necessary space-charge or equipotential distribution, and these remain to be specified for the notion of acceleration by double layers to be credible.", "fundamentally, poisson's equation indicates that there can be no configuration of charge resulting in a net potential drop.", "inexplicably though, some authors still invoke quasi-static parallel electric fields as net accelerators of auroral electrons, citing interpretations of transient observations of fields and particles as supporting this theory as firm fact.", "in another example, there is little justification given for saying 'fast observations demonstrate detailed quantitative agreement between the measured electric potentials and the ion beam energies...., leaving no doubt that parallel potential drops are a dominant source of auroral particle acceleration'.", "another theory is based on acceleration by landau resonance in the turbulent electric fields of the acceleration region.", "this process is essentially the same as that employed in plasma fusion laboratories throughout the world, and appears well able to account in principle for most \u2013 if not all \u2013 detailed properties of the electrons responsible for the brightest forms of auroras, above, below and within the acceleration region.", "other mechanisms have also been proposed, in particular, alfv\u00e9n waves, wave modes involving the magnetic field first noted by hannes alfv\u00e9n (1942), which have been observed in the laboratory and in space.", "the question is whether these waves might just be a different way of looking at the above process, however, because this approach does not point out a different energy source, and many plasma bulk phenomena can also be described in terms of alfv\u00e9n waves.other processes are also involved in the aurora, and much remains to be learned.", "auroral electrons created by large geomagnetic storms often seem to have energies below 1 kev and are stopped higher up, near 200\u00a0km.", "such low energies excite mainly the red line of oxygen so that often such auroras are red.", "on the other hand, positive ions also reach the ionosphere at such time, with energies of 20\u201330 kev, suggesting they might be an \"overflow\" along magnetic field lines of the copious \"ring current\" ions accelerated at such times, by processes different from the ones described above.some o+ ions (\"conics\") also seem accelerated in different ways by plasma processes associated with the aurora.", "these ions are accelerated by plasma waves in directions mainly perpendicular to the field lines.", "they, therefore, start at their \"mirror points\" and can travel only upward.", "as they do so, the \"mirror effect\" transforms their directions of motion, from perpendicular to the field line to a cone around it, which gradually narrows down, becoming increasingly parallel at large distances where the field is much weaker.", "the discovery of a 1770 japanese diary in 2017 depicting auroras above the ancient japanese capital of kyoto suggested that the storm may have been 7% larger than the carrington event, which affected telegraph networks.", "the auroras that resulted from the \"great geomagnetic storm\" on both 28 august and 2 september 1859, however, are thought to be the most spectacular in recent recorded history.", "in a paper to the royal society on 21 november 1861, balfour stewart described both auroral events as documented by a self-recording

and effects, [botelho] created a plastic universe as the symbolic and imaginative mirror of one of the most significant facets of the portuguese spirit\".", "he records the city, \"but, more deeply,

the first investor-owned electric utility in 1882 on pearl street station, new york city.", "on september 4, 1882, edison switched on his pearl street generating station's electrical power distribution system, which provided 110 volts direct current (dc) to 59 customers in lower manhattan.", "in january 1882, edison switched on the first steam-generating power station at holborn viaduct in london.", "the dc supply system provided electricity supplies to street lamps and several private dwellings within a short distance of the station.", "on january 19, 1883, the first standardized incandescent electric lighting system employing overhead wires began service in roselle, new jersey.", "as edison expanded his direct current (dc) power delivery system, he received stiff competition from companies installing alternating current (ac) systems.", "from the early 1880s, ac arc lighting systems for streets and large spaces had been an expanding business in the us.", "with the development of transformers in europe and by westinghouse electric in the us in 1885\u20131886, it became possible to transmit ac long distances over thinner and cheaper wires, and \"step down\" the voltage at the destination for distribution to users.", "this allowed ac to be used in street lighting and in lighting for small business and domestic customers, the market edison's patented low voltage dc incandescent lamp system was designed to supply.", "edison's dc empire suffered from one of its chief drawbacks: it was suitable only for the high density of customers found in large cities.", "edison's dc plants could not deliver electricity to customers more than one mile from the plant, and left a patchwork of unsupplied customers between plants.", "small cities and rural areas could not afford an edison style system at all, leaving a large part of the market without electrical service.", "ac companies expanded into this gap.", "edison expressed views that ac was unworkable and the high voltages used were dangerous.", "as george westinghouse installed his first ac systems in 1886, thomas edison struck out personally against his chief rival stating, \"just as certain as death, westinghouse will kill a customer within six months after he puts in a system of any size.", "he has got a new thing and it will require a great deal of experimenting to get it working practically.\"", "many reasons have been suggested for edison's anti-ac stance.", "one notion is that the inventor could not grasp the more abstract theories behind ac and was trying to avoid developing a system he did not understand.", "edison also appeared to have been worried about the high voltage from misinstalled ac systems killing customers and hurting the sales of electric power systems in general.", "primary was the fact that edison electric based their design on low voltage dc and switching a standard after they had installed over 100 systems was, in edison's mind, out of the question.", "by the end of 1887, edison electric was losing market share to westinghouse, who had built 68 ac-based power stations to edison's 121 dc-based stations.", "to make matters worse for edison, the thomson-houston electric company of lynn, massachusetts (another ac-based competitor) built 22 power stations.", "parallel to expanding competition between edison and the ac companies was rising public furor over a series of deaths in the spring of 1888 caused by pole mounted high voltage alternating current lines.", "this turned into a media frenzy against high voltage alternating current and the seemingly greedy and callous lighting companies that used it.", "edison took advantage of the public perception of ac as dangerous, and joined with self-styled new york anti-ac crusader harold p. brown in a propaganda campaign, aiding brown in the public electrocution of animals with ac, and supported legislation to control and severely limit ac installations and voltages (to the point of making it an ineffective power delivery system) in what was now being referred to as a \"battle of currents\".", "the development of the electric chair was used in an attempt to portray ac as having a greater lethal potential than dc and smear westinghouse at the same time via edison colluding with brown and westinghouse's chief ac rival, the thomson-houston electric company, to make sure the first electric chair was powered by a westinghouse ac generator.", "thomas edison's staunch anti-ac tactics were not sitting well with his own stockholders.", "by the early 1890s, edison's company was generating much smaller profits than its ac rivals, and the war of currents would come to an end in 1892 with edison forced out of controlling his own company.", "that year, the financier j.p. morgan engineered a merger of edison general electric with thomson-houston that put the board of thomson-houston in charge of the new company called general electric.", "general electric now controlled three-quarters of the us electrical business and would compete with westinghouse for the ac market.", "edison moved from menlo park after the death of his first wife, mary, in 1884, and purchased a home known as \"glenmont\" in 1886 as a wedding gift for his second wife, mina, in llewellyn park in west orange, new jersey.", "in 1885, thomas edison bought 13 acres of property in fort myers, florida, for roughly $2,750 and built what was later called seminole lodge as a winter retreat.", "the main house and guest house are representative of italianate architecture

then shipped down by boat and were constructed at a cost of $12,000 each, which included the cost of interior furnishings.", "edison and mina spent many winters at their home in fort myers, and edison tried to find a domestic source of natural rubber.", "due to the security concerns around world war i, edison suggested forming a science and industry committee to provide advice and research to the us military, and he headed the naval consulting board in 1915.", "edison became concerned with america's reliance on foreign supply of rubber and was determined to find a native supply of rubber.", "edison's work on rubber took place largely at his research laboratory in fort myers, which has been designated as a national historic chemical landmark.", "the laboratory was built after thomas edison, henry ford, and harvey firestone pulled together $75,000 to form the edison botanical research corporation.", "initially, only ford and firestone were to contribute funds to the project while edison did all the research.", "edison, however, wished to contribute $25,000 as well.", "edison did the majority of the research and planting, sending results and sample rubber residues to his west orange lab.", "edison employed a two-part acid-base extraction, to derive latex from the plant material after it was dried and crushed to a powder.", "after testing 17,000 plant samples, he eventually found an adequate source in the goldenrod plant.", "edison decided on solidago leavenworthii, also known as leavenworth's goldenrod.", "the plant, which normally grows roughly 3\u20134 feet tall with a 5% latex yield, was adapted by edison through cross-breeding to produce plants twice the size and with a latex yield of 12%.", "during the 1911 new york electrical show, edison told representatives of the copper industry it was a shame he didn't have a \"chunk of it\".", "the representatives decided to give a cubic foot of solid copper weighing 486 pounds with their gratitude inscribed on it in appreciation for his part in the \"continuous stimulation in the copper industry\".", "edison is credited with designing and producing the first commercially available fluoroscope, a machine that uses x-rays to take radiographs.", "until edison discovered that calcium tungstate fluoroscopy screens produced brighter images than the barium platinocyanide screens originally used by wilhelm r\u00f6ntgen, the technology was capable of producing only very faint images.", "the fundamental design of edison's fluoroscope is still in use today, although edison abandoned the project after nearly losing his own eyesight and seriously injuring his assistant, clarence dally.", "dally made himself an enthusiastic human guinea pig for the fluoroscopy project and was exposed to a poisonous dose of radiation; he later died (at the age of 39) of injuries related to the exposure, mediastinal cancer.", "in 1903, a shaken edison said: \"don't talk to me about x-rays, i am afraid of them.\"", "nonetheless, his work was important in the development of a technology still used today.", "edison invented a highly sensitive device, that he named the tasimeter, which measured infrared radiation.", "his impetus for its creation was the desire to measure the heat from the solar corona during the total solar eclipse of july 29, 1878. the device was not patented since edison could find no practical mass-market application for it.", "the key to edison's fortunes was telegraphy.", "with knowledge gained from years of working as a telegraph operator, he learned the basics of electricity.", "this allowed him to make his early fortune with the stock ticker, the first electricity-based broadcast system.", "on august 9, 1892, edison received a patent for a two-way telegraph.", "edison was granted a patent for the motion picture camera or \"kinetograph\".", "he did the electromechanical design while his employee william kennedy dickson, a photographer, worked on the photographic and optical development.", "much of the credit for the invention belongs to dickson.", "in 1891, thomas edison built a kinetoscope or peep-hole viewer.", "this device was installed in penny arcades, where people could watch short, simple films.", "the kinetograph and kinetoscope were both first publicly exhibited may 20, 1891.", "in april 1896, thomas armat's vitascope, manufactured by the edison factory and marketed in edison's name, was used to project motion pictures in public screenings in new york city.", "later, he exhibited motion pictures with voice soundtrack on cylinder recordings, mechanically synchronized with the film.", "officially the kinetoscope entered europe when wealthy american businessman irving t. bush (1869\u20131948) bought from the continental commerce company of frank z. maguire and joseph d. baucus a dozen machines.", "bush placed from october 17, 1894, the first kinetoscopes in london.", "at the same time, the french

calls including titles such as fred ott's sneeze (1894), the kiss (1896), the great train robbery (1903), alice's adventures in wonderland (1910), and the first frankenstein film in 1910. in 1903, when the owners of luna park, coney island announced they would execute topsy the elephant by strangulation, poisoning, and electrocution (with the electrocution part ultimately killing the elephant), edison manufacturing sent a crew to film it, releasing it that same year with the title electrocuting an elephant.", "as the film business expanded, competing exhibitors routinely copied and exhibited

ore was scarce on the east coast of the united states and edison tried to mine low-grade ore. edison developed a process using rollers and crushers that could pulverize rocks up to 10 tons.", "the dust was then sent between three giant magnets that would pull the iron ore from the dust.", "despite the failure of his mining company, the edison ore milling company, edison used some of the materials and equipment to produce cement.", "in 1901, edison visited an industrial exhibition in the sudbury area in ontario, canada and thought nickel and cobalt deposits there could be used in his production of electrical equipment.", "he returned as a mining prospector and is credited with the original discovery of the falconbridge ore body.", "his attempts to mine the ore body were not successful, and he abandoned his mining claim in 1903. a street in falconbridge, as well as the edison building, which served as the head office of falconbridge mines, are named for him.", "in the late 1890s edison worked on developing a lighter, more efficient rechargeable battery (at that time called an \"accumulator\").", "he looked on them as something customers could use to power their phonographs but saw other uses for an improved battery, including electric automobiles.", "the then available lead acid rechargeable batteries were not very efficient and that market was already tied up by other companies so edison pursued using alkaline instead of acid.", "he had his lab work on many types of materials (going through some 10,000 combinations), eventually settling on a nickel-iron combination.", "besides his experimenting edison also probably had access to the 1899 patents for a nickel\u2013iron battery by the swedish inventor waldemar jungner.", "edison obtained a us and

rather, absence of sentiment, he makes poetry.\"", "what this means, and what makes caeiro such an original poet is the way he apprehends existence.", "he does not question anything whatsoever; he calmly accepts the world as it is.", "the recurrent themes to be found in nearly all of caeiro's poems are wide-eyed childlike wonder at the infinite variety of nature, as noted by a critic.", "he is free of metaphysical entanglements.", "central to his world-view is the idea that in the world around us, all is surface: things are precisely what they seem, there is no hidden meaning anywhere.",

senses, and his feelings, without any interpretation whatsoever.", "caeiro attempts to approach nature from a qualitatively different mode of apprehension; that of simply perceiving (an approach akin to phenomenological approaches to philosophy).", "poets before him would make use of intricate metaphors to describe what was before them; not so caeiro: his self-appointed task is to bring these objects to the reader's attention, as directly and simply as possible.", "caeiro sought a direct experience of the objects before him.", "as such it is not surprising to find that caeiro has been called an anti-intellectual, anti-romantic, anti-subjectivist, anti-metaphysical...an anti-poet, by critics; caeiro simply\u2014is.", "he is in this sense very unlike his creator fernando pessoa: pessoa was besieged by metaphysical uncertainties; these were, to a large extent, the cause of his unhappiness; not so caeiro: his attitude is anti-metaphysical; he avoided uncertainties by adamantly clinging to a certainty: his belief that there is no meaning behind things.", "things, for him, simply\u2014are.", "caeiro represents a primal vision of reality, of things.", "he is the pagan incarnate.", "indeed, caeiro was not simply a pagan but paganism itself.", "the critic jane m. sheets sees the insurgence of caeiro\u2014who was pessoa's first major heteronym\u2014as essential in founding the later poetic personas: by means of this artless yet affirmative anti-poet, caeiro, a short-lived but vital member of his coterie, pessoa acquired the base of an experienced and universal poetic vision.", "after caeiro's tenets had been established, the avowedly poetic voices of campos, reis and pessoa himself spoke with greater assurance.", "in a letter to william bentley,  pessoa wrote that \"a knowledge of the language would be indispensable, for instance, to appraise the 'odes' of ricardo reis, whose portuguese would draw upon him the blessing of ant\u00f3nio vieira, as his

questioning life.", "he is a modern pagan who urges one to seize the day and accept fate with tranquility.", "\"wise is the one who does not seek.", "the seeker will find in all things the abyss, and doubt in himself.", "\"[citation needed] in this sense, reis shares essential affinities with caeiro.", "believing in the greek gods, yet living in a christian europe, reis feels that his spiritual life is limited and true happiness cannot be attained.", "this, added to his belief in fate as a driving force for all that exists, as such disregarding freedom, leads to his epicureanist philosophy, which entails the avoidance of pain, defending that man should seek tranquility and calm above all else, avoiding emotional extremes.", "where caeiro wrote freely and spontaneously, with joviality, of his basic, meaningless connection to the world, reis writes in an austere, cerebral manner, with premeditated rhythm and structure and a particular attention to the correct use of the language when approaching his subjects of, as characterized by richard zenith, \"the brevity of life, the vanity of wealth and struggle, the joy of simple pleasures, patience in time of trouble, and avoidance of extremes\".", "in his detached, intellectual approach, he is closer to fernando pessoa's constant rationalization, as such representing the orthonym's wish for measure and sobriety and a world free of troubles and respite, in stark contrast to caeiro's spirit and style.", "as such, where caeiro's predominant attitude is that of joviality, his sadness being accepted as natural (\"my sadness is a comfort for it is natural and right.", "\"), reis is marked by melancholy, saddened by the impermanence of all things.", "ricardo reis is the main character of jos\u00e9 saramago's 1986 novel the year of the death of ricardo reis.", "\u00e1lvaro de campos manifests, in a way, as a hyperbolic version of pessoa himself.", "of the three heteronyms he is the one who feels most strongly, his motto being 'to feel everything in every way.'", "'the best way to travel,' he wrote, 'is to feel.'", "as such, his poetry is the most emotionally intense and varied, constantly juggling two fundamental impulses: on the one hand a feverish desire to be and feel everything and everyone, declaring that 'in every corner of my soul stands an altar to a different god' (alluding to walt whitman's desire to 'contain multitudes'), on the other, a wish for a state of isolation and a sense of nothingness.", "as a result, his mood and principles varied between violent, dynamic exultation, as he fervently wishes to experience the entirety of the universe in himself, in all manners possible (a particularly distinctive trait in this state being his futuristic leanings, including the expression of great enthusiasm as to the meaning of city life and its components) and a state of nostalgic melancholy, where life is viewed as, essentially, empty.", "one of the poet's constant preoccupations, as part of his dichotomous character, is that of identity: he does not know who he is, or rather, fails at achieving an ideal identity.", "wanting to be everything, and inevitably failing, he despairs.", "unlike caeiro, who asks nothing of life, he asks too much.", "in his poetic meditation 'tobacco shop' he asks:", "how should i know what i'll be, i who don't know what i am?to be what i think?", "but i think of being so many things!", "mensagem, written in portuguese, is a symbolist epic made up of 44 short poems organized in three parts or cycles:", "the first, called \"bras\u00e3o\" (coat-of-arms),

material and spiritual natures of portugal.", "each of the remaining poems associates to each charge a historical personality.", "ultimately they all lead to the golden age of discovery.", "the second

and still bent on accomplishing a universal empire.", "the third cycle, called \"o encoberto\" (\"the hidden one\"), refers to pessoa's vision of a future world of peace and the fifth empire (which, according to pessoa, is spiritual and not material, because if it were material england would already have achieved it).", "after the age of force, (vis), and taedium (otium) will come science

accomplishment of portugal.", "king sebastian is very important, indeed he appears in all three parts of mensagem.", "he represents the capacity of dreaming, and believing that it's possible to achieve dreams.", "one of the most famous quotes from mensagem is the first line from o infante (belonging to the second part), which is deus quer, o homem sonha, a obra nasce (which translates roughly to \"god wishes, man dreams, the work is born\").", "another well-known quote from mensagem is the first line from ulysses, \"o mito \u00e9 o nada que \u00e9 tudo\" (a possible translation is

status due to the largely acknowledged outbreak of war.", "this particular negative impact on his artwork then forced segall to create a series of images of his troubled jewish childhood and to depict the large number of emigration waves that he grew up with, as well.", "these images also portrayed universal suffering of human existence.", "still haunted by rio de janeiro's mangue, segall created images that stayed throughout his late career.", "much of his earlier impact of human suffering led segall to create one of his most famous artworks in 1939 and 1940, known as navio de emigrantes (ship of emigrants).", "the image depicts a heavily condensed and large number of people on the dock of a ship.", "although this does not coincide with much of segall's previous work of human suffering, this provides the audience with a deep depiction of (at the time) the contemporary and controversial waves of emigrants and human affliction and persecution.", "later in the mid-1940s,

images in a stark manner, yet the underprivileged and oppressed images provides a significant cultural identity for the rio de janeiro inhabitants.", "in 1949 till his death in 1957, he continued to work on engraving and painting mangue as well as producing a series entitled wandering women and forests.", "segall's subject matter was portrayed more subtly and softer in his early career.", "he did not depict much of the african influence on his artwork until he moved to brazil.", "it was not until segall visited brazil for the first few times, that he branched out towards the expressionist style.", "he was able to express himself in a freer manner while he portrayed the lifelong theme of his jewish culture depicting the tribulations of european jews.", "although he was a humanist, he never forgot his jewish roots.", "segall's initial paintings in brazil reflect a strong national connection and passion for his newfound homeland.", "he portrayed the landscapes in s\u00e3o paulo and rio de janeiro and portrayed the different races without tension or malintention.", "however, segall remained faithful towards his cubist nature throughout the majority of his artworks.", "specifically, one of his famous artworks, entitled banana plantation, shows a brazilian banana plantation, thick in density.", "segall achieved balance in this painting by centering the worker's neck and head protruding from the bottom of the painting.", "this causes the audience to be fully focused towards the center space.", "this significant symmetrical balance emphasizes the human element involved in the brazilian agricultural system.", "the diminished amount of slavery in brazil during this time period, the 1920s, abolished brazilian-negro slaves and replaced them with an overwhelming number of european workers coming to brazil.", "this particular image portrays the engulfment of the plantations by the europeans.", "other prominent theme in segall's work is human suffering and emigration.", "in another famous artwork of segall's, entitled ship of emigrants, a ship dock is overcrowded and engulfed with emigrant passengers.", "not only does the image portray a dark and

a non-muslim of anything related to islam\", such as the penalty of stoning to death under islamic law.", "to gandhi, islam has \"nothing to fear from criticism even if it be unreasonable\".", "he

adopted was to work with muslim leaders of pre-partition india, to oppose the british imperialism in and outside the indian subcontinent.", "after the world war i, in 1919\u201322, he won muslim leadership support of ali brothers by backing the khilafat movement in favour the islamic caliph and his historic ottoman caliphate, and opposing the secular islam supporting mustafa kemal

involved in the khilafat movement and the middle east affairs between britain and the ottoman empire.", "gandhi explained to his co-religionists (hindu) that he sympathised and campaigned for the islamic cause, not because he cared for the sultan, but because \"i wanted to enlist the mussalman's sympathy in the matter of cow protection\".", "according to the historian m. naeem qureshi, like the then indian muslim leaders who had combined religion and politics, gandhi too imported his religion into his political strategy during the khilafat movement.", "in the 1940s, gandhi pooled ideas with some muslim leaders who sought religious harmony like him, and opposed the proposed partition of british india into india and pakistan.", "for example, his close friend badshah khan suggested that they should work towards opening hindu temples for muslim prayers, and islamic mosques for hindu prayers, to bring the two religious groups closer.", "gandhi accepted this and began having muslim prayers read in hindu temples to play his part, but was unable to get hindu prayers read in mosques.", "the hindu nationalist groups objected and began confronting gandhi for this one-sided practice,

salvation\".", "gandhi did not support laws to prohibit missionary activity, but demanded that christians should first understand the message of jesus, and then strive to live without stereotyping and

the same bed but clothed, and finally he slept naked with women.", "in april 1945, gandhi referenced being naked with several \"women or girls\" in a letter to birla as part of the experiments.", "according to the 1960s memoir of his grandniece manu, gandhi feared in early 1947 that he and she may be killed by muslims in the run up to india's independence in august 1947, and asked her when she was 18 years old if she wanted to help him with his experiments to test their \"purity\", for which she readily accepted.", "gandhi slept naked in the same bed with manu with the bedroom doors open

western media.", "in february 1947, he asked his confidants such as birla and ramakrishna if it was wrong for him to experiment his brahmacharya oath.", "gandhi's public experiments, as they progressed, were widely discussed and criticised by his family members and leading politicians.", "however, gandhi said that if he would not let manu sleep with him, it would be a sign of weakness.",

states gandhi's views on brahmacharya and religious renunciation experiments were a method to confront women issues in his times.", "gandhi spoke out against untouchability early in his life.", "before 1932, he and his associates used the word antyaja for untouchables.", "in a major speech on untouchability at nagpur in 1920, gandhi called it a great evil in hindu society but observed that it was not unique to hinduism, having deeper roots, and stated that europeans in south africa treated \"all of us, hindus and muslims, as untouchables; we may not reside in their midst, nor enjoy the rights which they do\".", "calling the doctrine of untouchability intolerable, he asserted that the practice could be eradicated, that hinduism was flexible enough to allow eradication, and that a concerted effort was needed to persuade people of the wrong and to urge them to eradicate it.", "according to christophe jaffrelot, while gandhi considered untouchability to be wrong and evil, he believed that caste or class is based on neither inequality nor inferiority.", "gandhi believed that individuals should freely intermarry whomever they wish, but that no one should expect everyone to be his friend: every individual, regardless of background, has a right to choose whom he will welcome into his home, whom he will befriend, and whom he will spend time with.", "in 1932, gandhi began a new campaign to improve the lives of the untouchables, whom he began to call harijans, \"the children of god\".", "on 8 may 1933, gandhi began a 21-day fast of self-purification and launched a year-long campaign to help the harijan movement.", "this campaign was not universally embraced by the dalit community: ambedkar and his allies felt gandhi was being paternalistic and was undermining dalit political rights.", "ambedkar described him as \"devious and untrustworthy\".", "he accused gandhi as someone who wished to retain the caste system.", "ambedkar and gandhi debated their ideas and concerns, each trying to persuade the other.", "in 1935, ambedkar announced his intentions to leave hinduism and join buddhism.", "according to sankar ghose, the announcement shook gandhi, who reappraised his views and wrote many essays with his views on castes, intermarriage, and what hinduism says on the subject.", "these views contrasted with those of ambedkar.", "yet in the elections of 1937, excepting some seats in mumbai which ambedkar's party won, india's untouchables voted heavily in favour of gandhi's campaign and his party, the congress.", "gandhi and his associates continued to consult ambedkar, keeping him influential.", "ambedkar worked with other congress leaders through the 1940s and wrote large parts of india's constitution in the late 1940s, but did indeed convert to buddhism in 1956. according to jaffrelot, gandhi's views evolved between the 1920s and 1940s; by 1946, he actively encouraged intermarriage between castes.", "his approach, too, to untouchability differed from ambedkar's, championing fusion, choice, and free intermixing, while ambedkar envisioned each segment of society maintaining its group identity, and each group then separately advancing the \"politics of equality\".", "ambedkar's criticism of gandhi continued to influence the dalit movement past gandhi's death.", "according to arthur herman, ambedkar's hatred for gandhi and gandhi's ideas was so strong that, when he heard of gandhi's assassination, he remarked after a momentary silence a sense of regret and then added, \"my real enemy is gone; thank goodness the eclipse is over now\".", "according to ramachandra guha, \"ideologues have carried these old rivalries into the present, with the demonization of gandhi now common among politicians who presume to speak in ambedkar's

favoured an education system with far greater emphasis on learning skills in practical and useful work, one that included physical, mental and spiritual studies.", "his methodology sought to treat all professions equal and pay everyone the same.", "gandhi called his ideas nai talim (literally, 'new education').", "he believed that the western style education violated and destroyed the indigenous cultures.", "a different basic education model, he believed, would lead to better self awareness, prepare people to treat all work equally respectable and valued, and lead to a society with less social diseases.", "nai talim evolved out of his experiences at the tolstoy farm in south africa, and gandhi attempted to formulate the new system at the sevagram ashram after 1937. nehru government's vision of an industrialised, centrally planned economy after 1947 had scant place for gandhi's village-oriented approach.", "in his autobiography, gandhi wrote that he believed every hindu boy and girl must learn sanskrit because its historic and spiritual texts are in that language.", "gandhi believed that swaraj not only can be attained with non-violence, it can be run with non-violence.", "a military is unnecessary, because any aggressor can be thrown out using the method of non-violent non-co-operation.", "while military is unnecessary in a nation organised under swaraj principle, gandhi added that a police force is necessary given human nature.", "however, the state would limit the use of weapons by the police to the minimum, aiming for their use as a restraining force.", "according to gandhi, a non-violent state is like an \"ordered anarchy\".", "in a society of mostly non-violent individuals, those who are violent will sooner or later accept discipline or leave the community, stated gandhi.", "he emphasised a society where individuals believed more in learning about their duties and responsibilities, not demanded rights and privileges.", "on returning from south africa, when gandhi received a letter asking for his participation in writing a world charter for human rights, he responded saying, \"in my experience, it is far more important to have a charter for human duties.\"", "swaraj to gandhi did not mean transferring colonial era british power brokering system, favours-driven, bureaucratic, class exploitative structure and mindset into indian hands.", "he warned such a transfer would still be english rule, just without the englishman.", "\"this is not the swaraj i want\", said gandhi.", "tewari states that gandhi saw democracy as more than a system of government; it meant promoting both individuality and the self-discipline of the community.", "democracy meant settling disputes in a nonviolent manner; it required freedom of thought and expression.", "for gandhi, democracy was a way of life.", "some scholars state gandhi supported a religiously diverse india, while others state that the muslim leaders who championed the partition and creation of a separate muslim pakistan considered gandhi to be hindu nationalist or revivalist.", "for example, in his letters to mohammad iqbal, jinnah accused gandhi to be favouring a hindu rule and revivalism, that gandhi led indian national congress was a fascist party.", "in an interview with c.f.", "andrews, gandhi stated that if we believe all religions teach the same message of love and peace between all human beings, then there is neither any rationale nor need for proselytisation or attempts to convert people from one religion to another.", "gandhi opposed missionary organisations who criticised indian religions then attempted to convert followers of indian religions to islam or christianity.", "in gandhi's view, those who attempt to convert a hindu, \"they must harbour in their breasts the belief that hinduism is an error\" and that their own religion is \"the only true religion\".", "gandhi believed that people who demand religious respect and rights must also show the same respect and grant the same rights to followers of other religions.", "he stated that spiritual studies must encourage \"a hindu to become a better hindu, a mussalman to become a better mussalman, and a christian a better christian.\"", "according to gandhi, religion is not about what a man believes, it is about how a man lives, how he relates to other people, his conduct towards others, and one's relationship to one's conception of god.", "it is not important to convert or to join any religion, but it is important to improve one's way of life and conduct by absorbing ideas from any source and any religion, believed gandhi.", "gandhi believed in sarvodaya economic model, which literally means \"welfare, upliftment of all\".", "this, states bhatt, was a very different economic model than the socialism model championed and followed by free india by nehru \u2013 india's first prime minister.", "to both, according to bhatt, removing poverty and unemployment were the objective, but the gandhian economic and development approach preferred adapting technology and infrastructure to suit the local situation, in contrast to nehru's large scale, socialised state owned enterprises.", "to gandhi, the economic philosophy that aims at \"greatest good for the greatest number\" was fundamentally flawed, and his alternative proposal sarvodaya set its aim at the \"greatest good for all\".", "he believed that the best economic system not only cared to lift the \"poor, less skilled, of impoverished background\" but also empowered to lift the \"rich, highly skilled, of capital means and landlords\".", "violence against any human being, born poor or rich, is wrong, believed gandhi.", "he stated that the mandate theory of majoritarian democracy should not be pushed to absurd extremes, individual freedoms should never be denied, and no person should ever be made a social or economic slave to the \"resolutions of majorities\".", "gandhi challenged nehru and the modernizers in the late 1930s who called for rapid industrialisation on the soviet model; gandhi denounced that as dehumanising and contrary to the needs of the villages where the great majority of the people lived.", "after gandhi's assassination, nehru led india in accordance with his personal socialist convictions.", "historian kuruvilla pandikattu says \"it was nehru's vision, not gandhi's,

with marx, according to the political theory scholar and economist bhikhu parekh.", "gandhi refused to endorse the view that economic forces are best understood as \"antagonistic class interests\".", "he argued that no man can degrade or brutalise the other without degrading and brutalising himself and that sustainable economic growth comes from service, not from exploitation.", "further, believed gandhi, in a free nation, victims exist only when they co-operate with their oppressor, and an economic and political system that offered increasing alternatives gave power of choice to the poorest man.", "while disagreeing with nehru about the socialist economic model, gandhi also critiqued capitalism that was driven by endless wants and a materialistic view of man.", "this, he believed, created a vicious vested system of materialism at the cost of other human needs such as spirituality and social relationships.", "to gandhi, states parekh, both communism and capitalism were wrong, in part because both focussed exclusively on materialistic view of man, and because the former deified the state with unlimited power of violence, while the latter deified capital.", "he believed that a better economic system is one which does not impoverish one's culture and spiritual pursuits.", "gandhism designates the ideas and principles gandhi promoted; of central importance is nonviolent resistance.", "a gandhian can mean either an individual who follows, or a specific philosophy which is attributed to, gandhism.", "m. m. sankhdher argues that gandhism is not a systematic position in metaphysics or in political philosophy.", "rather, it is a political creed, an economic doctrine, a religious outlook, a moral precept, and especially, a humanitarian world view.", "it is an effort

illiterate, whilst having an economy focused on the export of commodities, and lacking infrastructure in industry, health and education systems that could serve as material and human support to the war effort.", "in addition, an action plan that could circumvent this situation (like the calogeras plan of the previous world war) was out of the question, since many brazilian military officers did not see favorably some unavoidable internal consequences that would result in an nazi-fascist defeat in europe, such as increased demands for democratic changes by the general population.", "at the time, brazil was living under a military regime, that had been openly authoritarian from 1937, and that had been sympathetic to nazi-fascist regimes until 1941. brazil was thus precluded from pursuing a line of autonomous action in the conflict, and found it difficult to take even a modest role in it.", "faced with the government's passivity and unwillingness, plutocrat of the mass media, assis

reasons, political distrust between the brazilian and american authorities, as well as divergences regarding the brazilian expeditionary force as about its size (between brazilian aspirations and the american convenience in managing it abroad) and on whether it should be properly trained and armed before boarding, or be stationed already behind the lines at the italian front; caused almost two years to elapse before the official entrance of brazil into the war and the sending of its first troops to the european theater of operations (compared with almost one year between the usa's entrance and the operation torch).", "in the end, the brazilian government gathered a force of one army division of 25,000 men (replacements included), compared with an initial declared goal of a whole army

gothic line.", "allied forces were unable to break through the mountains over the winter and an offensive by german and italian divisions to the left of the feb sector, against the us 92nd infantry

the brazilian division and the us 10th mountain division were able to capture important positions on the northern apennines (noteworthy in the brazilian sector, for monte castello and castelnuovo),

offensive on the italian front began on april 14, after a bombardment of 2,000 artillery pieces; an attack carried out by the troops of us iv corps led by the brazilian division took montese.", "after the first day of the allied offensive, the germans, without much effort, had stopped the main attack of iv corps led by the us 10th mountain division, causing significant casualties among the troops of that formation.", "the germans were misled into thinking that the feb's raid over montese, using m8 armoured cars and sherman tanks, could be the real main allied objective in that sector, which led them to shell the brazilians with 1,800 artillery rounds from the total of 2,800 used against all four allied divisions in that sector during the days of the battle for montese, when they tried unsuccessfully to take montese back from the brazilians.", "after that, the breaking of the germans' lines to the north by forces of iv corps became unavoidable.", "on the right, the polish division,
