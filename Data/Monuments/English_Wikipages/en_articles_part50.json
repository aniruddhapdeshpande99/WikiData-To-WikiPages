by the opening of the southeast passage to asia around africa by bartolomeu dias in 1488, when he reached the cape of good hope (modern-day south africa).", "washington irving's 1828 biography of columbus popularized the idea that columbus had difficulty obtaining support for his plan because many catholic theologians insisted that the earth was flat.", "in fact, nearly all educated westerners had understood, at least since the time of aristotle, that the earth is spherical.", "the sphericity of the earth is also accounted for in the work of ptolemy, on which medieval astronomy was largely based.", "christian writers whose works clearly reflect the conviction that the earth is spherical include saint bede the venerable in his reckoning of time, written around ad 723. in columbus's time, the techniques of celestial navigation, which use the position of the sun and the stars in the sky, together with the understanding that the earth is a sphere, had long been in use by astronomers and were beginning to be implemented by mariners.", "as far back as the 3rd century bc, eratosthenes had correctly computed the circumference of the earth by using simple geometry and studying the shadows cast by objects at two remote locations.", "in the 1st century bc, posidonius confirmed eratosthenes's results by comparing stellar observations at two separate locations.", "these measurements were widely known among scholars, but confusion about the old-fashioned units of distance in which they were expressed led to some debate about the size of the earth.", "[citation needed]", "from pierre d'ailly's imago mundi columbus learned of alfraganus's estimate that a degree of latitude (or a degree of longitude along the equator) spanned 56\u200b2\u20443 arabic miles (which works out to 66.2 nautical miles (122.6\u00a0km)), but did not realize that this was expressed in the arabic mile rather than the shorter roman mile with which he was familiar.", "he therefore would have estimated the circumference of the earth to be about 30,200 kilometres (16,300\u00a0nmi) at the equator and 26,200 kilometres (14,100\u00a0nmi) at 30 degrees north (around where he was sailing), whereas the correct value is 40,075 kilometres (21,639\u00a0nmi) at the equator and 34,735 kilometres (18,755\u00a0nmi) at 30 degrees north.", "[citation needed]", "furthermore, most scholars accepted ptolemy's estimate that eurasia spanned 180\u00b0 longitude, rather than the actual 130\u00b0 (to the chinese mainland) or 150\u00b0 (to japan at the latitude of spain).", "columbus, for his part, believed an even higher estimate, leaving a smaller percentage for water.", "some people have suggested he followed the estimate of marinus of tyre, which put the longitudinal span of the eurasian landmass at 225\u00b0.", "[citation needed]  other people have suggested he followed esdras's statement that \"six parts [of the globe] are habitable and the seventh is covered with water.\"", "he also believed that japan (which he called \"cipangu\", following marco polo) was much larger, farther to the east from china (\"cathay\"), and closer to the equator than it is, and that there were inhabited islands even farther to the east than japan, including the mythical antillia, which he thought might lie not much farther to the west than the azores.", "in this, he was influenced by the ideas of toscanelli.", "columbus therefore would have estimated the distance from the canary islands west to japan to be about 9,800 kilometres (5,300\u00a0nmi) or 3,700 kilometres (2,000\u00a0nmi), depending on which estimate he used for eurasia's longitudinal span.", "the true figure is now known to be vastly larger: about 20,000 kilometres (11,000\u00a0nmi).", "[c] no ship in the 15th century could have carried enough food and fresh water for such a long voyage, and the dangers involved in navigating through the uncharted ocean would have been formidable.", "most european navigators reasonably concluded that a westward voyage from europe to asia was unfeasible.", "the catholic monarchs, however, having completed an expensive war in the iberian peninsula, were eager to obtain a competitive edge over other european countries in the quest for trade with the indies.", "columbus's project, though far-fetched, held the promise of such an advantage.", "[citation needed]", "though columbus was wrong about the number of degrees of longitude that separated europe from the far east and about the distance that each degree represented, he did possess valuable knowledge about the trade winds, which would prove to be the key to his successful navigation of the atlantic ocean.", "during his first voyage in 1492, the brisk trade winds from the east, commonly called \"easterlies\", propelled columbus's fleet for five weeks, from the canary islands to the bahamas.", "the precise first land sighting and landing point was san salvador island.", "to return to spain against this prevailing wind would have required several months of an arduous sailing technique, called beating, during which food and drinkable water would probably have been exhausted.", "instead, columbus returned home by following the curving trade winds northeastward to the middle latitudes of the north atlantic, where he was able to catch the \"westerlies\" that blow eastward to the coast of western europe.", "there, in turn, the winds curve southward towards the iberian peninsula.", "it is unclear whether columbus learned about the winds from his own sailing experience or if he had heard about them from others.", "the corresponding technique for efficient travel in the atlantic appears to have been exploited first by the portuguese, who referred to it as the volta do mar (\"turn of the sea\").", "columbus's knowledge of the atlantic wind patterns was, however, imperfect at the time of his first voyage.", "by sailing directly due west from the canary islands during hurricane season, skirting the so-called horse latitudes of the mid-atlantic, columbus risked either being becalmed or running into a tropical cyclone, both of which, by chance, he avoided.", "in 1485, columbus presented his plans to king john ii of portugal.", "he proposed that the king equip three sturdy ships and grant columbus one year's time to sail out into the atlantic, search for a western route to the orient, and return.", "columbus also requested he be made \"great admiral of the ocean\", appointed governor of any and all lands he discovered, and given one-tenth of all revenue from those lands.", "the king submitted columbus's proposal to his experts, who rejected it.", "it was their considered opinion that columbus's estimation of a travel distance of 2,400 miles (3,860\u00a0km) was, in fact, far too low.", "in 1488, columbus again appealed to the court of portugal, resulting in john ii again inviting him for an audience.", "that meeting also proved unsuccessful, in part because not long afterwards bartolomeu dias returned to portugal with news of his successful rounding of the southern tip of africa (near the cape of good hope).", "with an eastern sea route to asia apparently at hand, king john was no longer interested in columbus's far-fetched project.", "columbus traveled from portugal to both genoa and venice, but he received encouragement from neither.", "he had also dispatched his brother bartholomew to the court of henry vii of england to inquire whether the english crown might sponsor his expedition, but also without success.", "columbus had sought an audience from the monarchs ferdinand ii of aragon and isabella i of castile, who had united several kingdoms in the iberian peninsula by marrying and were ruling together.", "on 1 may 1486, permission having been granted, columbus presented his plans to queen isabella, who, in turn, referred it to a committee.", "after the passing of much time, the savants of spain, like their counterparts in portugal, replied that columbus had grossly underestimated the distance to asia.", "they pronounced the idea impractical and advised their royal highnesses to pass on the proposed venture.", "however, to keep columbus from taking his ideas elsewhere, and perhaps to keep their options open, the catholic monarchs gave him an annual allowance of 12,000 maravedis and, in 1489, furnished him with a letter ordering all cities and towns under their domain to provide him food and lodging at no cost.", "after continually lobbying at the spanish court and two years of negotiations, he finally had success in january 1492. ferdinand and isabella had just conquered granada, the last muslim stronghold on the iberian peninsula, and they received columbus in c\u00f3rdoba, in the alc\u00e1zar castle.", "isabella turned him down on the advice of her confessor.", "columbus was leaving town by mule in despair when ferdinand intervened.", "isabella then sent a royal guard to fetch him, and ferdinand later claimed credit for being \"the principal cause why those islands were discovered\".", "in the april 1492 \"capitulations of santa fe\", king ferdinand and queen isabella promised columbus that if he succeeded he would be given the rank of admiral of the ocean sea and appointed viceroy and governor of all the new lands he could claim for spain.", "he had the right to nominate three persons, from whom the sovereigns would choose one, for any office in the new lands.", "he would be entitled to 10 percent of all the revenues from the new lands in perpetuity.", "additionally, he would also have the option of buying one-eighth interest in any commercial venture with the new lands and receive one-eighth of the profits.", "columbus was later arrested in 1500 and dismissed from his posts.", "he and his sons, diego and fernando, then conducted a lengthy series of court cases against the castilian crown, known as the pleitos colombinos, alleging that the crown had illegally reneged on its contractual obligations to columbus and his heirs.", "the columbus family had some success in their first litigation, as a judgment of 1511 confirmed diego's position as viceroy, but reduced his powers.", "diego resumed litigation in 1512, which lasted until 1536, and further disputes continued until 1790.", "between 1492 and 1503, columbus completed four round-trip voyages between spain and the americas, each voyage being sponsored by the crown of castile.", "on his first voyage, he independently discovered the americas and magnetic declination.", "[d] these voyages marked the beginning of the european exploration and colonization of the american continents, and are thus of enormous significance in western history.", "columbus always insisted, in the face of mounting evidence to the contrary, that the lands that he visited during those voyages were part of the asian continent, as previously described by marco polo and other european travelers.", "columbus's refusal to accept that the lands he had visited and claimed for spain were not part of asia might explain, in part, why the american continent was named after the florentine explorer amerigo vespucci and not after columbus.", "on the evening of 3 august 1492, columbus departed from palos de la frontera with three ships.", "the largest was a carrack (spanish: nao), the santa mar\u00eda ex-gallega

pinta, mart\u00edn alonso pinz\u00f3n, verified the sight of land and alerted columbus by firing a lombard.", "columbus later maintained that he himself had already seen a light on the land a few hours earlier, thereby claiming for himself the lifetime pension promised by ferdinand and isabella to the first person to sight land.", "columbus called the island (in what is now the bahamas) san

laoco\u00f6n remains uncertain.", "artists and connoisseurs debated how the missing parts should be interpreted.", "michelangelo suggested that the missing right arms were originally bent back over the shoulder.", "others, however, believed it was more appropriate to show the right arms extended outwards in a heroic gesture.", "according to vasari, in about 1510 bramante, the pope's architect, held an informal contest among sculptors to make replacement right arms, which was judged by raphael, and won by jacopo sansovino.", "the winner, in the outstretched position, was used in copies but not attached to the original group, which remained as it was until 1532, when giovanni antonio montorsoli, a pupil of michelangelo, added his even more straight version of laoco\u00f6n's outstretched arm, which remained in place until modern times.", "in 1725-27 agostino cornacchini added a section to the younger son's arm, and after 1816 antonio canova tidied up the group after their return from

perfectly with a corresponding hole on the other.\"", "in the 1980s the statue was dismantled and reassembled, again with the pollak arm incorporated.", "the restored portions of the children's arms and hands were removed.", "in the course of disassembly, it was possible to observe breaks, cuttings, metal tenons, and dowel holes which suggested that in antiquity, a more compact, three-dimensional pyramidal grouping of the three figures had been used or at least contemplated.", "according to seymour howard, both the vatican group and the sperlonga sculptures \"show a similar taste for open and flexible pictorial organization that called for pyrotechnic piercing and lent itself to changes at the site, and in new situations\".", "the more open, planographic composition along a plane, used in the restoration of the laoco\u00f6n group, has been interpreted as \"apparently the result of serial reworkings by roman imperial as well as renaissance and modern craftsmen\".", "a different reconstruction was proposed by seymour howard, to give \"a more cohesive, baroque-looking and diagonally-set pyramidal composition\", by turning the older son as much as 90\u00b0, with his back to the side of the altar, and looking towards the frontal viewer rather than at his father.", "other suggestions have been made.", "the discovery of the laoco\u00f6n made a great impression on italian artists and continued to influence italian art into the baroque period.", "michelangelo is known to have been particularly impressed by the massive scale of the work and its sensuous hellenistic aesthetic, particularly its depiction of the male figures.", "the influence of the laoco\u00f6n, as well as the belvedere torso, is evidenced in many of michelangelo's later sculptures, such as the rebellious slave and the dying slave, created for the tomb of pope julius ii.", "several of the ignudi and the figure of haman in the sistine chapel ceiling draw on the figures.", "raphael used the

the sculpture by portraying three apes instead of humans.", "it has often been interpreted as a satire on the clumsiness of bandinelli's copy, or as a commentary on debates of the time around the similarities between human and ape anatomy.", "it has also been suggested that this woodcut was one of a number of renaissance images that were made to reflect contemporary doubts as to the authenticity of the laoco\u00f6n group, the 'aping' of the statue referring to the incorrect pose of the trojan priest who was depicted in ancient art in the traditional sacrificial pose, with his leg raised to subdue the bull.", "over 15 drawings of the group made by rubens in rome have survived, and the influence of the figures can be seen in many of his major works, including his descent from

the paradox of admiring beauty while seeing a scene of death and failure.", "the most influential contribution to the debate, gotthold ephraim lessing's essay laocoon: an essay on the limits of painting and poetry, examines the differences between visual and literary art by comparing the sculpture with virgil's verse.", "he argues that the artists could not realistically depict the physical suffering of the victims, as this would be too painful.", "instead, they had to express suffering while retaining beauty.", "the most unusual intervention in the debate, william blake's annotated print laoco\u00f6n, surrounds the image with graffiti-like commentary in several languages, written in multiple directions.", "blake presents the sculpture as a mediocre copy of a lost israelite original, describing it as \"jehovah & his two sons satan & adam as they were copied from the cherubim of solomons temple by three rhodians & applied to natural fact or history of ilium\".", "this reflects blake's theory that the imitation of ancient greek and roman art was destructive to the creative imagination, and that classical sculpture represented a banal naturalism in contrast to

on a corner pendentive of the sistine chapel, also involves figures struggling with snakes - the fiery serpents of the book of exodus.", "he invited contrast between the \"meagre lines and contemptible tortures of the laocoon\" and the \"awfulness and quietness\" of michelangelo, saying \"the slaughter of the dardan priest\" was \"entirely wanting\" in sublimity.", "furthermore, he attacked the composition on naturalistic grounds, contrasting the carefully studied human anatomy of the restored figures with the unconvincing portrayal of the snakes:", "for whatever knowledge of the human frame there may be in the laoco\u00f6n, there is certainly none of the habits of serpents.", "the fixing of the snake's head in the side of the principal figure is as false to nature, as it is poor in composition of line.", "a large serpent never wants to bite, it wants to hold, it seizes therefore always where it can hold best, by the extremities, or throat, it seizes once and forever, and that before it coils, following up the seizure with the twist of its body round the victim, as invisibly swift as the twist of a whip lash round any hard object it may strike, and then it holds fast, never moving the jaws or the body, if its prey has any power of struggling left, it throws round another coil, without quitting the hold with the jaws; if laoco\u00f6n had had to do with real serpents, instead of pieces of tape with heads to them, he would have been held still, and not allowed to throw his arms or legs about.", "in 1910 the critic irving babbit used the title the new

court, cabral may have been part of a faction that furthered his appointment.", "the historian malyn newitt subscribes to some sort of ulterior maneuvering and has said that the choice of cabral \"was

italian maritime republics and the ottoman empire.", "portugal's expansionism would lead first to a route to india, and later to worldwide colonization.", "a desire to spread catholic christianity to pagan lands was another factor motivating exploration.", "there also was a long tradition of pushing back muslims, which stemmed from portugal's fight for nationhood against the moors.", "the fight expanded first to north africa and eventually to the indian subcontinent.", "an additional ambition which galvanized the explorers was the search for the mythical prester john\u2014a powerful

contact.", "he set foot on land and exchanged gifts with the indigenous people.", "after coelho returned, cabral took the fleet north, where after traveling 65 kilometres (40\u00a0mi) along the coast, it anchored on 24 april in what the commander-in-chief named porto seguro (safe port).", "the place was a natural harbor, and afonso lopes (pilot of the lead ship) brought two natives aboard to confer with cabral.", "as in the first contact, the meeting was friendly and cabral presented the locals with gifts.", "the inhabitants were stone age hunter-gatherers, to whom the europeans assigned the

successfully negotiated with the zamorin (the title of the ruler of calicut) and obtained permission to establish a factory and a warehouse.", "in hopes of further improving relations, cabral dispatched his men on several military missions at the zamorin's request.", "[f] however, on 16 or 17 december, the factory suffered a surprise attack by some 300 (according to other accounts, perhaps as many as several thousand) muslim arabs and hindu indians.", "despite a desperate defense by crossbowmen, more than 50 portuguese were killed.", "[g] the remaining defenders retreated to the ships, some by swimming.", "thinking that the attack was the result of unauthorized incitement by jealous arab merchants, cabral waited 24 hours for an explanation from the ruler of calicut, but no apology was forthcoming.", "the portuguese were outraged by the attack on the factory and the death of their comrades and seized 10 arab merchant ships at anchor in the harbor.", "around 600 of their crews were killed and the cargoes confiscated before the merchantmen were set afire.", "cabral also ordered his ships to bombard calicut for an entire day in reprisal for the violation of the agreement.", "the massacre was blamed in part on portuguese animosity towards muslims, which had developed over centuries of conflict with the moors on the iberian peninsula and in north africa.", "moreover, the portuguese were determined to dominate the spice trade and had no intention of allowing competition to flourish.", "the arabs also had no desire to allow the portuguese to break their monopoly on access to spices.", "the portuguese had started out by insisting on being given preferential treatment in every aspect of the trade.", "the letter from king manuel i brought by cabral to the ruler of calicut, which was translated by the ruler's arab interpreters, sought the exclusion of arab traders.", "the muslim merchants believed that they were about to lose both their trading opportunities and livelihoods, and attempted to sway the hindu ruler against the portuguese.", "the portuguese and arabs were extremely suspicious of each other's every action.", "historian william greenlee has argued that the portuguese realized that \"they were few in numbers and that those who would come to india in the future fleets would always be at numerical disadvantage; so that this treachery must be punished in a manner so decisive that the portuguese would be feared and respected in the future.", "it was their superior artillery which would enable them to accomplish this end.\"", "thus, they created a precedent for european behavior in asia during the following centuries.", "warnings in reports from vasco da gama's voyage to india had prompted king manuel i to brief cabral regarding another port to the south of calicut where he could also trade.", "this city was kochi and the fleet set sail, reaching it on 24 december.", "kochi was nominally a vassal of calicut, as well as being dominated by other indian cities.", "kochi was eager to achieve independence, and the portuguese were willing to exploit indian disunity\u2014as the british would three hundred years later.", "this tactic eventually ensured portuguese hegemony over the region.", "cabral forged an alliance with kochi's ruler, as well with rulers of other indian cities, and was able to establish a factory.", "at last, loaded with precious spices, the fleet went to kannur for further trade before setting out on its return voyage to portugal on 16 january 1501.", "the expedition headed for the east coast of africa.", "one of the ships became stranded on a sandbar and the vessel began to founder.", "as there was no space in the other ships, its cargo was lost and cabral ordered the carrack to be set on fire.", "the fleet then proceeded to the island of mozambique (northeast of sofala), in order to take on provisions and make the ships ready for the rough passage around the cape of good hope.", "one caravel was sent to sofala\u2014another of the expedition's goals.", "a second caravel, considered the fastest ship in the fleet and captained by nicolau coelho, was sent ahead to give the king advance notice of the voyage's success.", "a third vessel, commanded by pedro de ata\u00edde, became separated from the fleet after leaving mozambique.", "on 22 may, the fleet\u2014now reduced to only two ships\u2014rounded the cape of good hope.", "they arrived in beseguiche (now dakar, located near cape verde) on 2 june.", "there they found not only nicolau coelho's caravel but also the nau captained by diogo dias\u2014which had been lost for over a year following the disaster in the south atlantic.", "the nau had experienced several adventures of its own[h] and was now in poor condition with only seven sick and malnourished men aboard\u2014one of whom was so weak that he died of happiness upon again seeing his comrades.", "another portuguese fleet was also found riding at anchor in beseguiche.", "after manuel i had been told of the discovery of what is now brazil, he sent another and smaller fleet to explore it.", "one of its navigators was amerigo vespucci (for whom the americas would be named), who told cabral of his exploration, confirming that he had indeed made landfall on an entire continent and not merely an island.", "nicolau coelho's caravel departed first from beseguiche and arrived in portugal on 23 june 1501. cabral stayed behind, waiting for pedro de ata\u00edde's missing ship and for the caravel that had been sent to sofala.", "both eventually appeared and cabral arrived in portugal on 21 july 1501, with the other vessels coming home during the following days.", "in all, two ships returned empty, five were fully loaded and six were lost.", "nonetheless, the cargoes carried by the fleet returned up to 800% profit to the portuguese crown.", "once sold, the proceeds covered the outlay in equipping the fleet, covered the cost of the vessels which had been lost, and cleared a profit which itself exceeded the total sum of those costs.", "\"undeterred by the unprecedented losses which he had sustained\", asserts historian james mcclymont, when cabral \"reached the east african coast, pressed forward to the accomplishment of the task which had been assigned to him and was able to inspire the surviving officers and men with like courage.\"", "\"few voyages to brazil and india were so well executed as cabral's\", affirmed historian bailey diffie, which laid down a path leading to the immediate commencement \"of a portuguese seagoing empire from africa to the far east\", and eventually to \"a land empire in brazil\".", "upon cabral's return, king manuel i began planning another fleet to make the journey to india and to avenge the portuguese losses in calicut.", "cabral was selected to command this \"revenge fleet\", as it was called.", "for eight months cabral made all preparations, but for reasons which remain uncertain, he was relieved of command.", "it had apparently been proposed to give another navigator, vicente sodr\u00e9, independent command over a section of the fleet, and cabral strongly opposed this.", "whether he was dismissed or requested himself that he be relieved of command, the result was that when the fleet departed in march 1502, its commander was vasco da gama\u2014a maternal nephew of vicente sodr\u00e9\u2014and not cabral.", "it is known that hostility had developed between a faction supporting da gama and another supporting cabral.", "at some point, cabral left the court permanently.", "the king was greatly irritated by the feud, to such an extent that mentioning the matter in his presence could result in banishment, as it did for one of da gama's supporters.", "despite the loss of favor with manuel i, cabral was able to contract an advantageous marriage in 1503 to dona (lady) isabel de castro, a wealthy noblewoman and descendant of king dom fernando i of portugal.", "her mother was a sister of afonso de albuquerque, one of the greatest portuguese military leaders during the age of discovery.", "the couple had at least four children: two boys (fern\u00e3o \u00e1lvares cabral and ant\u00f3nio cabral) and two girls (catarina de castro and guiomar de castro).", "there were two additional daughters named isabel and leonor according to other sources, which also say that guiomar, isabel and leonor joined religious orders.", "afonso de albuquerque attempted to intercede on cabral's behalf and on 2 december 1514 asked manuel i to forgive him and allow his return to court, but to no avail.", "suffering from recurrent fever and a tremor (possibly malaria) since his voyage, cabral withdrew to santar\u00e9m in 1509. he spent his remaining years there.", "only sketchy information is available as to his activities during that time.", "according to a royal letter dated 17 december 1509, cabral was party to a dispute over a transaction involving property which belonged to him.", "another letter of that same year reported that he was to receive certain privileges for an undisclosed military service.", "in 1518, or perhaps previously, he was raised from fidalgo to knight in the king's council and was entitled to a monthly allowance of 2,437 reais.", "this was in addition to the annual allowance granted to him in 1497, and still being paid.", "cabral died of unspecified causes, most probably in 1520. he was buried in the s\u00e3o jo\u00e3o evangelista chapel of the convento da gra\u00e7a in santar\u00e9m.", "the first permanent portuguese settlement in the land which would become brazil was s\u00e3o vicente, which was established in 1532 by martim afonso de sousa.", "as the years passed, the portuguese would slowly expand their frontiers westward, conquering more lands from both indigenous americans and the spanish.", "brazil had secured most of its present-day borders by 1750 and was regarded by portugal as the most important part of its far-flung maritime empire.", "on 7 september 1822, the heir of portuguese king dom jo\u00e3o vi secured the independence of brazil from portugal and, as dom pedro i, became its first emperor.", "cabral's discovery, and even his resting place in the land of his birth, had been almost completely forgotten during the span of nearly 300 years since his expedition.", "this began to change beginning in the 1840s when emperor dom pedro ii, successor and son of pedro i, sponsored research and publications dealing with cabral's life and expedition through the brazilian historic and geographic institute.", "this was part of the emperor's ambitious larger plan to foster and strengthen a sense of nationalism among brazil's diverse citizenry\u2014giving them a common identity and history as residents of a unique portuguese-speaking empire, surrounded by hispanic-american republics.", "the initial resurgence of interest in cabral had resulted from the rediscovery, in 1839, of his resting place by the brazilian historian francisco adolfo de varnhagen (later viscount of porto seguro).", "the completely neglected state in which cabral's tomb was found nearly led to a diplomatic crisis between brazil and portugal\u2014the latter then ruled by pedro ii's eldest sister, maria ii.", "in 1871, the brazilian emperor\u2014then on a trip to europe\u2014visited cabral's gravesite and proposed an exhumation for scientific study, which was carried out in 1882. in a second exhumation during 1896, an urn containing earth and bone fragments was allowed to be removed.", "although his remains still lay in portugal, the urn was eventually brought to the old cathedral of rio de janeiro in brazil on 30 december 1903. cabral has since become a national hero in brazil.", "in portugal, however, he has been much overshadowed by his rival vasco da gama.", "historian william greenlee argued that cabral's exploration is important \"not only because of its position in the history of geography but because of its influence on the history and economics of the period.\"", "though he acknowledges that few voyages have \"been of greater importance to posterity\", he also says that \"few have been less appreciated in their time.\"", "nevertheless, historian james mcclymont affirmed that \"cabral's position in the history of portuguese conquest and discovery is inexpungable despite the supremacy of greater or more fortunate men.\"", "he concluded that cabral \"will always be remembered in history as the chief, if not the first discoverer of brazil.\"", "a controversy that has occupied scholars for more than a century concerns whether cabral's discovery was by chance or intentional.", "if the latter, that would mean that the portuguese had at least some hint that a land existed to the west.", "the matter was first raised by emperor pedro ii in 1854 during a session of the brazilian historic and geographic institute, when he asked if the discovery might have been intentional.", "until the 1854 conference, the widespread presumption was that the discovery had been an accident.", "early works on the subject supported this view,

atlantic\", there are no irrefutable proofs to support it.", "this opinion is also shared by historian thomas skidmore.", "the debate on whether it was a deliberate voyage of discovery or not is

from what is today cabo de santo agostinho (brazilian state of pernambuco) to the mouth of the amazon river.", "there he encountered another spanish expedition led by lepe, which would reach as far as the oyapock river in march.", "the reason cabral is credited with having discovered brazil, rather than the spanish explorers, is because the visits by pinz\u00f3n and lepe were cursory and had no lasting impact.", "historians capistrano de abreu, francisco adolfo de varnhagen, m\u00e1rio barata and h\u00e9lio vianna concur that the spanish expeditions did not influence the development of what

something less than a full-fledged monarchy: it often calls him negid, for example, meaning \"prince\" or \"chief\", rather than melek, meaning \"king\"; the biblical david sets up none of the complex

possible outcome of economic decisions.", "finally, a sophisticated operations room (opsroom) would provide a space where managers could see relevant economic data, formulate feasible responses to emergencies, and transmit advice and directives to enterprises and factories in alarm situations by using the telex network.", "in conjunction with the system, the cybersyn development team also planned the so-called cyberfolk device system, a closed television circuit connected to an interactive apparatus that would enable the citizenry to actively participate in economic and political

halt.", "government supporters also helped to mobilize trucks and buses but violence served as a deterrent to full mobilization, even with police protection for the strike-breakers.", "allende's

descendants of indigenous people, who supported allende's reforms, and the white elite increased.", "allende raised wages on a number of occasions throughout 1970 and 1971, but these wage hikes were negated by the in-tandem inflation of chile's fiat currency.", "although price rises had also been high under frei (27% a year between 1967 and 1970), a basic basket of consumer goods rose by 120%

1970 elections, but drifted away from those positions during allende's presidency, eventually forming a coalition with the national party)[citation needed], continued to accuse allende of leading chile toward a cuban-style dictatorship, and sought to overturn many of his more radical policies.", "allende and his opponents in congress repeatedly accused each other of undermining the chilean constitution and acting undemocratically.", "allende's increasingly bold socialist policies (partly in response to pressure from some of the more radical members within his coalition), combined with
