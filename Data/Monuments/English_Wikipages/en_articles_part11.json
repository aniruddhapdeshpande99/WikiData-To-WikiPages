educational memorial, one which would incorporate a computer room, exhibits, and a theater.", "she pledged that no memorial would be built which detracted from the dignity of arlington national

competitions tended to generate grandiose schemes which would be inappropriate for the hemicycle.", "vaught agreed with brown's concerns.", "on june 28, 1988, the cfa unanimously approved the

entire cost of the memorial was estimated at $5 million.", "(the idea for statues was later dropped by the memorial's board of directors.", "according to vaught, \"it goes back to the choice we made

outstanding memorial.", "by noon on the second day, the finalists had been chosen.", "a jury report was then drafted for the finalists to use in revising their designs.", "the judging panel also identified an alternate in case one of the three finalists dropped out.", "before the short-list was announced, wmsamf officials noted that the alternate was considered by the judging panel to be very close to making the cut.", "the foundation made the alternate a finalist because it was the only design that located the memorial behind the hemicycle.", "the foundation agreed to include this submission as a fourth candidate in the revision round, although the team would not receive one of the $10,000 prizes.", "the three top finalists and their designs were:", "the fourth entry was by

mention\".", "the four finalists and nine honorable mentions were put on public display during the summer at the national building museum.", "in the revision round, wmsamf asked the finalists to focus on the computerized visitors' center, the auditorium, and the restoration of the hemicycle.", "none of the finalists, the foundation said, successfully addressed all three issues.", "wmsamf asked the finalists to consider placing the visitors' center behind the hemicycle.", "as the revision round began, wmsamf estimated that the memorial would cost $25 million to build.", "however, it only had

to represent the barriers women had to pass through in their military careers.", "it was illuminated because tall or high monuments (arlington house, the lincoln memorial, the washington monument) were also illuminated at night.", "behind the hemicycle, underground, was the computer room and visitors' center.", "it contained a 225-seat auditorium, a bank of computer terminals, and niches for displays.", "the visitors' center was accessed by piercing the hemicycle in four places and creating stairs that led inside.", "transparent bridges criss-crossed the interior of the visitors' center,

of the memorial would begin in november 1991. the cost of the memorial alone (without hemicycle restoration) was estimated at just $15 million, another $10 million was required by law to endow the memorial with maintenance and operational funds.", "unfortunately, the foundation had raised only $700,000 to $750,000.", "the design required the approval of the commission of fine arts, national

too tall and would interfere with the vista between arlington house and the kennedy grave site toward the lincoln memorial, and that their light would detract from the existing monuments.", "the union leader newspaper quoted an unnamed official with an approval agency, \"there's just no way those prisms aren't going to get lopped off.", "they are just too much.\"", "marion weiss defended the memorial, arguing that the visit from arlington house was preserved and the lighting would be very soft.", "robert campbell also defended the design, arguing that a memorial to women was long overdue,

design never received a fair hearing.", "with the design process stalled, vaught focused on fundraising in 1990 and 1991 while a new design could be completed.", "six months after the design controversy broke, the women in military service for america memorial foundation had raised just $1 million.", "wmsamf announced a program in which state legislatures were asked to donate a dollar for

sold, forcing the foundation to extend the deadline for ticket sales to february 1991. wmsamf blamed the slow ticket sales on competition for another news event (secret footage of d.c. mayor marion barry smoking crack cocaine was made public), which made it difficult to get word about the raffle out to the public.", "by mid-january, just 27,000 tickets had been sold, and wmsa had raised a grand total of $2 million toward the memorial's cost.", "additionally, the legality of a raffle varied from state to state, with some states imposing restrictions on legal raffles and others not.", "the also hampered raffle efforts the foundation said.", "ten days before the raffle, just 28,000 tickets had been sold.", "organizers now said they hoped to sell just 100,000 tickets by the mid-february deadline.", "a third problem, the foundation claimed, was a downturn in the real estate market.", "since few people would want to pay the high property taxes on the home, the foundation assumed the

track with fund-raising, congress voted the foundation a two-year extension to complete its fund-raising efforts and get construction started.", "much of vaught's time between november 1989 and early 1992 was spent working with weiss/manfredi to modify the design of the memorial.", "the architects were, according to the washington post, \"distraught\" over the reaction to their design.", "but vaught encouraged them to implement their ideas in an alternative manner.", "in march 1992, wimsa announced it was ready to offer its design to the cfa, ncpc, and other approval agencies.", "the new design modified the hemicycle by restoring a low water feature to the central niche and removing the grass circle, replacing it with a circular reflecting pool and paved plaza.", "the center of the plaza was slightly lowered, and very low terraces led from the edge of the pool to the edge of the plaza.", "four niches were still pierced to create stairs leading up to the terrace, but now an elevator was added as well to make the memorial handicap-accessible.", "the tall illuminated pylons were removed, and in their place were 108 horizontal thick glass panels forming an arc in the back of the hemicycle's terrace.", "these panels formed the skylight for the memorial below, and weiss and manfredi said they would contain quotations from women who served in the military.", "a thin stream of water was intended to flow over the panels, as if \"carrying\" women's voices to the water feature and reflecting pool.", "trees still framed the reflecting pool, but underground, behind the

plaza.", "these had been moved back from the centerline but continued to screen the cemetery main gates.", "the cfa wanted these moved back even more, and the pleaching removed so that almost nothing was screened.", "the trees were intended to form a sort of entrance to the memorial, but the cfa did not like that approach.", "weiss and manfredi also had given more detail to the water feature.",

design.", "at the end of the meeting, the cfa approved the memorial design, but asked that their concerns about the plaza be addressed further.", "the revised plaza design was brought before the cfa

gave its final on april 6.", "in fact, no additional meetings with the cfa were held.", "the mock-ups were not created, the cfa never asked again for them, and weiss and manfredi quietly dropped the

conducted, extreme care was needed to avoid disturbing any of the graves near the memorial site.", "construction began in january 1996. almost 3,500 truckloads of soil were removed, and piles driven

charging $4,000 for use of its space.", "the memorial was still unable to pay about $2 million in construction costs in january 1998. wmsamf had raised $19 million of the $21.5 million in total costs
