sides with plant forms in the centre.", "there are unusual circular openings in the topmost storey, now thought to represent kneading-basins or grain-measuring vessels.", "below a cornice is the

"eurysaces' tomb, at the junction of the via praenestina and via labicana just before entering rome, was in a particularly prominent position, and its trapezoidal form was likely dictated by the space available.", "other burial complexes in the vicinity are known, including the columbarium of statilius taurus, consul at the time of augustus, with over seven hundred loculi or burial niches; and the

final word in this quote, \"apparet\", is often translated as public servant, the actual latin word for a public servant is apparitor.", "apparet is a verb meaning to appear or make apparent, this

\"this is the monument of marcus vergilius eurysaces, baker, contractor, it's obvious.\"", "a relief representing various stages of bread production runs along the top of the tomb.", "the relief depicts, on the south side, the delivery and grinding of grain and sifting of flour; on the north, the mixing and kneading of dough, forming of round loaves, and baking in a domed \"pizza-type\" oven;

breadbasket; and an urn taking the form of such a breadbasket.", "[note 2] theft of the female head from the relief in 1934 and uncertainty as to the present whereabouts of the urn, believed to be somewhere in the museo nazionale romano, mean their study is now conducted from excavation drawings and early photographs.", "reconstructions generally relate these items to the tomb on the grounds of
