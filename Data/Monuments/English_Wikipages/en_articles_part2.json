undertaking.", "the alcon\u00e9tar bridge has been classified as \"historical heritage\" since 1931 by the spanish authorities.", "main feature of the alcon\u00e9tar bridge was the segmental shape of its arches, which were rather uncommon in ancient bridge building: in a survey of roman bridges in hispania, only one in ten showed the same characteristics, the vast majority being of semi-circular design.", "according to prieto, the bridge had sixteen arches, not including the flood openings on the right approach, with the following spans (estimates are in square brackets):", "other sources

one adds the clear span of the arches and assumes, on the basis of the preserved piers, an average pier thickness of 4.4\u00a0m (14\u00a0ft), then the distance between both bridge ramps was 244\u00a0m (801\u00a0ft) (= 178 + 15 x 4.4), which corresponded to a river cross section of 73%.", "by comparison, the corresponding discharge profiles for the roman bridges of c\u00f3rdoba, of m\u00e9rida and

the water surface in the middle of the river, whilst on the left bank a further two piers remained standing, next to which the left abutment followed.", "the parts of the bridge moved to a safe place were essentially (see images): the right bridge ramp with its two arch-shaped flood openings, the piers 1, 2, and 3 with the remains of 4 and 6, as well as the vaults 1 and 3. the other scarce remains were submerged by the flooding of the alcantara reservoir in 1970.", "the approach to the ramp is 42\u00a0m (138\u00a0ft) long and 6.55\u20136.80\u00a0m (21.5\u201322.3\u00a0ft) wide.", "the clear spans of its two segmental arches are 6.95\u00a0m (22.8\u00a0ft) and 7.40\u00a0m (24.3\u00a0ft), which corresponds to a span-to-rise ratio of 4.0 and 3.3 to 1 respectively.", "the accurately fitting inclined contact surface of the springings clearly proves the roman origin of these arches.", "with an extraordinary width of 1.20\u00a0m (3\u00a0ft 11\u00a0in), the voussoirs appear oversized in relation to the span (arch slenderness of 1:5.8 and 6.2 respectively).", "in contrast, the two surviving bridge arches no.", "1 and 3 are instable substitutions, made of carelessly laid rubble.", "the date of these arches is unknown, as with all other repairs; possibly they were built in the period of the knights templar.", "equally evidently of post-classical origin is the masonry of the first two piers above the lower cornice, which projects from all piers at the same height.", "the superstructure of these piers could have been reconstructed for a drawbridge or a tower, which, according to an illustration in the voyage pittoresque, rested upon pier 2. in contrast, the third pier has still preserved its original roman character up to the top at 12.50\u00a0m (41.0\u00a0ft).", "its carefully worked ashlar and the second cornice, which ran along all ancient piers, provide us with the most distinct impression of the original shape of the roman bridge.", "in particular, it is possible to reconstruct relatively precisely the rise of the roman segmental arches on the basis of the angles of the inclined stone supports at the springing level.", "thus, the third arch originally described a circular sector of 95\u00b0, which points to a span-to-rise ratio of about 4\u20135 to 1 for the other segmental arches.", "this value is supported by de labordes' engravings which depict an intact roman segmental arch spanning the adjoining fourth bay as late as the early 19th century.", "along with other early examples, such as limyra bridge and the ponte san lorenzo, the alcon\u00e9tar bridge therefore ranks among the oldest segmental arched bridges in the world.", "its existence demonstrates that, in contrast to what had previously been widely believed and taught, roman bridge builders possessed intimate knowledge of flattened arches.", "the pier thicknesses, measuring 4.25\u00a0m (13.9\u00a0ft), 4.45\u00a0m (14.6\u00a0ft) and 4.55\u00a0m (14.9\u00a0ft), increase slightly towards the middle of the river, while the distances between the piers increase from 7.30\u00a0m (24.0\u00a0ft) to 10.20\u00a0m (33.5\u00a0ft).", "the fifth and ultimate pier, which carries the distinctive nickname \"bishop's table\", takes an advanced position in the riverbed and possesses by far the largest cross-section (8.10\u00a0m (26.6\u00a0ft)).", "it may be of medieval origin and could have served as a base for a watchtower, replacing two ancient arches.", "all five piers are strengthened on the upstream face by pointed cutwaters.", "the facing of the piers consists of local granite ashlar, set in parallel courses without the use of mortar or iron ties (opus quadratum); their interior, as those of the ramps, was filled with roman concrete, a common method applied for roman
