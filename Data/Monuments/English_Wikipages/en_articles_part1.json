building, and four domes that discharged to the facade.", "the staircases also house the water tanks; some of which are snail-shaped.", "the stepped roof of la pedrera, called \"the garden of warriors\" by the poet pere gimferrer because the chimneys appear to be protecting the skylights, has undergone a radical restoration, removing chimneys added in interventions after gaud\u00ed,

valencia tiles.", "one of the chimneys was topped with glass pieces\u00a0\u2013 it was said that gaud\u00ed did that the day after the inauguration of the building, taking advantage of the empty bottles from the party.", "it was restored with the bases of champagne bottles from the early twentieth century.", "the repair work has enabled the restoration of the original impact of the overhangs

segimon, who complained that there was no straight wall to place her steinway piano.", "gaud\u00ed's response was blunt: \"so play the violin.\"", "the result of these disagreements has been the loss

its original position would have been to tear down the monument.", "the result of the debate is unrecorded, but since the monument still stands the proposition was presumably rejected.", "the soviet sculptor vera mukhina (1889\u20131953; designer of the monumental sculpture worker and kolkhoz woman) is sometimes credited with the rescue of the monument, although there is no written evidence to support the fact.", "according to her son, she took part in a meeting where the fate of the monument was discussed, at which her opinion, as reported by her son, was that the monument was of very high artistic value and that its demolition might hurt the most sacred feelings of the latvian people.", "the freedom monument remained, but its symbolism was reinterpreted.", "the three stars were said to stand for the newly created baltic soviet republics \u2013 estonian ssr, latvian ssr, and lithuanian ssr \u2013 held aloft by mother russia, and the monument was said to have been erected after world war ii as a sign of popular gratitude toward the soviet leader joseph stalin for the liberation of the baltic states.", "in the middle of 1963, when the issue of demolition was raised again, it was decided that the destruction of a structure of such artistic and historic value, the building of which had been funded by donations of the residents of latvia, would only cause deep indignation, which in turn would cause tension in society.", "over time the misinterpretation of symbolism also was toned down and by 1988 the monument was said, with somewhat more accuracy, to have been built to \"celebrate the liberation from bondage of the autocracy of the tsar and german barons\", although withholding the fact that the bolshevik red army and the red latvian riflemen were also adversaries in the latvian war of independence.", "despite the soviet government's efforts, on june 14, 1987, about 5,000 people rallied to commemorate the those affected by soviet deportations.", "this event,

riga city council, for restoration.", "the monument was indeed restored in 2006, but this statement was later questioned, as politicians named various other reasons for the change of date, the
