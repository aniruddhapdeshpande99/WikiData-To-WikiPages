the people and finally to that of the nation.", "this transition between increasingly broader and generic concepts is due to the indistinct traits of the non-identification of the soldier.", "the

altar of the fatherland is always guarded by a guard of honour and two flames that burn perpetually in braziers.", "the guard is provided with military personnel of the various weapons of the italian armed forces, which alternate every ten years.", "the allegorical meaning of the perpetually burning flames is linked to their symbolism, which is centuries old, since it has its origins in classical antiquity, especially in the cult of the dead.", "a fire that burns eternally symbolizes the memory, in this case of the sacrifice of the unknown soldier moved by patriotic love, and his everlasting memory of the italians, even in those who are far from their country.", "the two perennial braziers next to the tomb of the unknown soldier is placed a plaque whose text reads \"italians abroad to the

ii national monument is indicated with two other names: \"(mole del) vittoriano\" and \"altare della patria\", which are now the most used names to call the monument.", "from 1921, when the unknown soldier was buried under the statue of the goddess rome in the part of the vittoriano that is called \"altare della patria\", the expression began to indicate not only the place of burial of the soldier, or the personification of all the fallen and lost in war, but the whole structure due to the strong popular sentiment for the symbolic unknown soldier.", "set against the external base of the vittoriano, on the sides of the entrance to piazza venezia, are the \"fountains of the two seas\" which are dedicated to the adriatic sea and the tyrrhenian sea.", "both are inserted in a flower bed

peninsula.", "this way the whole country is represented, even geographically.", "the exterior staircases of the vittoriano adapt to the ascending sides of the northern slope of the capitoline hill and

fatherland and of the italian unknown soldier, which represent the first raised platform of the vittoriano, as well as its symbolic centre.", "the path along the staircase continues even beyond the

propylaea.", "the artistic gate of access to the vittoriano, which is the work of manfredo manfredi, has the particularity of being \"hidden\", that is, of being able to slide vertically underground

entrance gate has a length of 40\u00a0m (131\u00a0ft) and a weight of 10,500 tons.", "on both sides of the entrance stairway, are a series of sculptures that accompany the visitor towards the altar of the fatherland.", "the first sculptures that meet are two sculptured groups in gilded bronze, with subjects inspired by the thought of giuseppe mazzini, the thought and the action (respectively, to the left and right of the staircase for those coming from piazza venezia), followed by two sculptural groups (also in this case one on each side) depicting as many winged lions and finally, on the top of the staircase, before the beginning of the terrace of the altar of the fatherland, two winged victorys.", "the thought and the action have been fundamental in the italian unification process, as they are necessary to change the course of history and to transform a society.", "the overall shape of the two sculptural groups recalls the intrinsic characteristics of the two concepts: the action has a triangular and angular profile, while the thought has a circular shape.", "the two winged lions represent the initiation of the patriots who decide to join the italian unification enterprise motivated by ardor and strength, which also control their instinctive side\u2014otherwise the patriots would slide towards the obfuscation of their abilities if the instinct were left completely free.", "the winged victories, in addition to recalling the military and cultural successes of the roman era, symbolize allegorically the good luck of national unity.", "at the end of the entrance stairway, immediately after the statues of the winged victories, opens the terrace of the altar of the fatherland, the first raised platform of the vittoriano, which is dominated centrally by the statue of the goddess rome and the shrine of the unknown soldier.", "on the terrace of the altar of the fatherland are also the botticino marble sculptural groups that symbolize the moral values of the italians, or the ideal principles that make the nation firm.", "the four groups have a height of 6\u00a0m (20\u00a0ft) and are located to the right and left of the entrance to the terrace of the altar of the fatherland (two on each side), sideways to the statues of the thought and of the action and in correspondence of the fountains of two seas, along the parapets that overlook piazza venezia.", "the concepts expressed by these four sculptural groups, the force, the concord, the sacrifice and the right, are the tangible emanation of the thought and the action.", "at the sides of the altar of the fatherland, the staircase resumes dividing into two symmetrical ramps parallel to the tomb of the unknown soldier.", "both reach a pronaos where two large doors open (one on each side, both positioned symmetrically and laterally to the unknown soldier, and each in correspondence with one of the two propylaea) that lead to the interior spaces of the vittoriano.", "above each door are two statues; on the left door are the politics and the philosophy, while on the right door are two statues depicting the war and the revolution.", "from the two shelves where the doors open to give access to the interior spaces, two further flights of stairs start that converge, directly behind the altar of the fatherland, towards the base of the equestrian statue of victor emmanuel ii\u2014the latter is located on the second large elevated platform, in order of height, of the vittoriano.", "behind it, the stairway resumes its ascent in the direction of the portico, reaching a small shelf, from which two staircases start laterally leading to the entrance of a propylaeum.", "before reaching the entrances of the propylaea, each of the two staircases is interrupted, creating a small intermediate shelf, which allows access to the terrace of the redeemed cities\u2014the third large and last elevated platform of the vittoriano\u2014directly behind the equestrian statue of victor emmanuel ii and immediately below the colonnade of the portico.", "the redeemed cities are those united to italy following the treaty of rapallo (1920) and the treaty of rome (1924), peace agreements at the end of the first world war.", "these municipalities are trieste, trento, gorizia, pola, fiume and zara.", "following the paris treaties of 1947, pola, fiume and zara moved on to yugoslavia and, after the dissolution of the latter, to croatia.", "after the conflict, gorizia was divided into two parts\u2014one part remained in italy while the other, which was renamed \"nova gorica\", passed first to yugoslavia and then to slovenia.", "each redeemed city is represented by an altar against the back wall, which bears the corresponding municipal coat of arms.", "the six altars were placed on the terrace between 1929 and 1930.", "at the centre of the row of altars of the redeemed cities, engraved on the stylobate, is a monumental inscription carved on the occasion of the solemn ceremony of the unknown soldier (4 november 1921) which contains the text of the victory bulletin, an official document written after the armistice of villa giusti with which the general

identified.", "located on the top of the entrance stairway, it was designed by the brescian sculptor angelo zanelli, who won a competition specially held in 1906. it is formed from the side of the tomb of italian unknown soldier that faces the outside of the building (the other side, which faces inside the vittoriano, is located in a crypt), from the sacellum of the statue of the goddess rome (which is exactly above the tomb of the unknown soldier) and two vertical marble reliefs that descend from the edges of the aedicula containing the statue of the goddess rome and which run downwards laterally to the tomb of the unknown soldier.", "the statue of the goddess roma present at the vittoriano interrupted a custom in vogue until the 19th century, by which the representation of this subject was with exclusively warlike traits.", "angelo zanelli, in his work, decided to further characterize the statue by also providing the reference to athena, greek goddess of wisdom and the arts, as well as of war.", "the great statue of the deity emerges from a golden background.", "the presence of the goddess roma in the vittoriano underlines the irremissible will of the unification of italy patriots to have the rome as the capital of italy, an essential concept, according to the common feeling, from the history of the peninsula and the islands of italian culture.", "the general conception of the bas-reliefs located laterally to the statue of the goddess rome, one to his left and the other to his right, recalls virgil's bucolics and georgics, which complete the triptych of the altar of the fatherland with the statue of the roman divinity.", "the allegorical meaning of the bas-reliefs that are inspired by the works of virgil is linked to the desire to conceptually render the italian soul.", "in the georgics, the reference to the aeneid is in fact present, and in both the works the industriousness in the work of the italians is recalled.", "the bas-relief on the left of the altar of the fatherland represents the triumph of labour and the one on the right symbolizes the triumph of the patriotic love where both converge scenically towards the statue of the goddess rome.", "after the altar of the fatherland is the equestrian statue of victor emmanuel ii, a bronze work by enrico chiaradia and architectural centre of the vittoriano.", "the personifications of the noble italian cities are carved on the marble base of the statue.", "the statue is bronze, 12\u00a0m (39\u00a0ft) high, 10\u00a0m (33\u00a0ft) long, and weighs 50 tons.", "including the marble base, the entire sculptural group is 24.80\u00a0m (81\u00a0ft) high.", "the equestrian statue of victor emmanuel ii is the only non-symbolic representation of the vittoriano, given that it is the representation of the homonymous monarch.", "in classical antiquity the equestrian statues were aimed at the exaltation of the portrayed subject, whose warlike virtues were emphasized.", "furthermore, riding and controlling a steed, the character's ability to control primordial instincts was communicated\u2014in this way, the subject was also recognized as civic virtues.", "also the placement of the statue at the architectural centre of the vittoriano, above the altar of the fatherland and in front of the colonnade of the portico, is not fortuitous\u2014in classical antiquity the equestrian statues were often situated in front of colonnades, public squares, temples or along the triumphal streets; in places, therefore, fundamental for their centrality.", "finally, the presence of the basement on which the personifications of the noble cities are carved is linked to the same archaic traditions.", "on the base of the equestrian statue of victor emmanuel ii are sculptural depictions of 14 italian noble cities, or rather the capitals of italian states founded before the savoy monarchy.", "it is of the most important statues in italy, and of those that were once capitals of ancient italian pre-unification monarchies, or of maritime republics, all of which are precedent and therefore historically converging towards the savoy monarchy\u2014for this reason they are considered \"mothers noble\"s of unification of italy.", "the 14 sculptural representations of the noble cities are deliberately placed at the base of the equestrian statue of victor emmanuel ii, which metaphorically symbolizes the nature of historical foundations of italy.", "in a broader sense, they also represent the concept that the unity of the homeland, as a whole, rests on a basis constituted by the municipalities.", "unlike those dedicated to the regions of italy, the statues depicting the 14 cities are all the work of the same sculptor, eugenio maccagnani.", "continuing to climb the stairway beyond the equestrian statue of victor emmnauel ii, is the most imposing and striking architectonic element\u2014the large portico with corinthian-style columns, slightly curved, located on the top of the monument, and inserted between two temple propylaea called \"sommoportico\" due to its elevated position.", "the propylaea are the two small porticos projecting with respect to the portico which are located at its lateral ends that constitute the entrances.", "the portico is 72\u00a0m (236\u00a0ft) long and is centrally supported by 16 15\u00a0m (49\u00a0ft) tall columns

roman forum near the vittoriano.", "each propylaeum has a bronze statue depicting quadrigae, each one hosting a winged victory.", "the architectural and expressive synergies of the triumphal arches

messengers descended from heaven by the divinities who flank the winner of a military battle as their favourite.", "the two quadrigae, as the latin inscriptions placed on the pediments of the underlying propylaea expressly declare, symbolize the freedom of the citizens (\"civium libertati\", right) and the unity of the homeland (\"patriae unitati\", left), the two concepts pivots that inform the entire monument and are attributed to the sovereign victor emmmanuel ii.", "the implicit message is that italy, once again a single political group and gained independence, leaving behind the glories of rome and the pomp of the papal court, is ready to spread a new italian renaissance articulated on the moral virtues represented allegorically in the vittoriano.", "the concepts \"freedom of citizens\" and \"unity of the homeland\" also summarize the fundamental themes that characterized the beginning and the end of the contribution given by victor emmanuel ii to the unification of italy.", "having ascended the throne for a few months, he published the proclamation of moncalieri (20 november 1849) which confirmed the survival of the liberal regime even in the repressive period following the wave of revolutions of 1848. his political work had ended with the capture of rome (20 september 1870), which became the capital, although the unification of trentino-alto adige and julian march (annexed only in 1919 after the first world war) were still missing.", "the quadrigas, already planned in the original project, were built and positioned in 1927.

propylea, and two at the entrance to the left propylea.", "each entrance leads to a large quadrangular vestibule, in dialogue with the outside due to a colonnade, and from the vestibules one enters the interior spaces of the portico.", "these rooms are decorated with mosaics, important works of floral liberty and pictorial symbolism, which cover the lunettes and the two domes of the propylaea.",

given to persons or causes that are unworthy.", "moreover, loyalty can lead patriots to support policies that are immoral and inhumane.", "thus, nathanson argues, patriotic loyalty can sometimes rather be a vice than a virtue, when its consequences exceed the boundaries of what is otherwise morally desirable.", "such loyalties, in nathanson's view, are erroneously unlimited in their scopes,

whistleblowing thus encompass a conflicting multiplicity of loyalties, where the traditional loyalty of the employee to the employer conflicts with the loyalty of the employee to his or her community, which the employer's business practices may be adversely affecting.", "vandekerckhove reports that different scholars resolve the conflict in different ways, some of which he, himself, does not find to be satisfactory.", "duska resolves the conflict by asserting that there is really only one proper object of loyalty in such instances, the community, a position that vandekerckhove counters by arguing that businesses are in need of employee loyalty.", "john corvino, associate professor of philosophy at wayne state university takes a different tack, arguing that loyalty can sometimes be a vice, not a virtue, and that \"loyalty is only a virtue to the extent that the object of loyalty is good\" (similar to nathanson).", "vandekerckhove calls this argument \"interesting\" but \"too vague\" in its description of how tolerant an employee should be of an employer's shortcomings.", "vandekerckhove suggests that duska and corvino combine, however, to point in a direction that makes
